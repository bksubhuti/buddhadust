					<h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Editor's Note:</h4>

					<p>There is a major mess-up in the numbering of AN 2 up passed sutta #289, the second chapter of Vagga XVII.<br/>
					To begin with the Pali is different in PTS, BJT and VRI.<br/>
					Woodward and the PTS text in the Pali has it for 289 and following:<br/>
					"...to bring about 1. The excellence and well-bring of the Order;<br/>
					2. The control of ill-conditioned monks and the comfort of good monks<br/>
					...3...etc.<br/>
					the following have been enjoined on his disciples. [Woodward and PTS omit what would be required for their ordering, the: 'What following?']<br/>
					1. The Obligations<br/>
					2. The Recitation of the Obligations<br/>
					3. and the following 27 concepts."<br/>
					His conclusion is a repeat of the question, not the usual statement of the conclusion.<br/>
					BJT has it in the only way it makes sense:<br/>
					289 ~:<br/>
					"...to bring about this pair of results the [Obligation] was enjoined on his disciples...what two?
					The excellence and well-bring of the Order."<br/>
					"...to bring about this pair of results the [Obligation] was enjoined on his disciples...what two?<br/>
					The control of ill-conditioned monks and the comfort of good monks<br/>
					...3...etc.<br/>
					"...to bring about this pair of results the [the recitation of the Obligation] was enjoined on his disciples...what two?<br/>
					The excellence and well-bring of the Order."<br/>
					"...to bring about this pair of results the [the recitation of the Obligation] was enjoined on his disciples...what two?<br/>
					The control of ill-conditioned monks and the comfort of good monks<br/>
					...3...etc.<br/>
					And on through the remaining 27 giving for each, each of the pairs, one sutta for each.<br/>
					Correcting Woodward to comply with the text went beyond the scope of the intent here to fully present the suttas according to Woodward by expanding to fill out abbreviated passages and so this alternative page was created for those wishing to see this section in the correctly expanded form following Woodward's vocabulary.</p>
