					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk who is well known,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					if possessed of three qualities,<br/>
					lives to the harm of many folk,<br/>
					to the misery of many folk,<br/>
					to the loss,<br/>
					harm<br/>
					and misery<br/>
					of devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three qualities?</p>

					<p class="f4">He encourages others to act contrary to the ordinances of Dhamma,<br/>
					he encourages others to speak contrary to the ordinances of Dhamma,<br/>
					he encourages others to have ideas contrary to Dhamma.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three qualities whereby<br/>
					a monk who is well known,<br/>
					lives to the harm of many folk,<br/>
					to the misery of many folk,<br/>
					to the loss,<br/>
					harm<br/>
					and misery<br/>
					of devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a monk who is well known,<br/>
					if possessed of three qualities,<br/>
					lives to the benefit of many folk,<br/>
					to the happiness <span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span> of many folk,<br/>
					to the profit,<br/>
					benefit<br/>
					and happiness<br/>
					of devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not encourage others to act contrary to the ordinances of Dhamma,<br/>
					he does not encourage others to speak contrary to the ordinances of Dhamma,<br/>
					he does not encourage others to have ideas contrary to Dhamma."</p>
