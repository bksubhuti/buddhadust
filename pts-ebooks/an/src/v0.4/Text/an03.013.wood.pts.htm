					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons are seen to exist in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who longs not,<br/>
					he who longs<br/>
					and he who has done with longings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person that longs not?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion, monks,<br/>
					suppose a certain man is born into a low family,<br/>
					the family of a scavenger<br/>
					or a hunter<br/>
					or a basket-weaver<br/>
					or a wheelwright<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					or a sweeper,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					or in the family of some wretched man<br/>
					hard put to it to find a meal<br/>
					or earn a living,<br/>
					where food and clothes<br/>
					are hard to get.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover he is ill-favoured,<br/>
					ugly,<br/>
					dwarfish,<br/>
					sickly,<br/>
					purblind,<br/>
					crooked,<br/>
					lame,<br/>
					or paralyzed,<br/>
					with never a bite or sup,<br/>
					nor any clothes,<br/>
					vehicle,<br/>
					bed,<br/>
					dwelling<br/>
					or lights,<br/>
					no perfumes<br/>
					or flower-garlands.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So and so of the ruling caste<br/>
					has been anointed by the rulers<br/>
					with the ruler's consecration.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But it never occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder<br/>
					will the rulers anoint me<br/>
					with the ruler's consecration?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, monks, is called<br/>
					'a person that longs not.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person that longs?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, there is the elder son of a rajah,<br/>
					a ruler duly anointed,<br/>
					and he is fit to be consecrated,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					but has not been,<br/>
					and has reached the age of discretion.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So and so of the ruling caste<br/>
					has been anointed by the rulers<br/>
					with the ruler's consecration.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder<br/>
					will the rulers anoint me<br/>
					with the ruler's consecration?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br/>
					'a person that longs.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person<br/>
					that has done with longings?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[93]</b></span> In this connexion, suppose there is a rajah,<br/>
					of the ruling caste,<br/>
					duly anointed<br/>
					with the ruler's consecration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So and so of the ruling caste<br/>
					has been duly anointed<br/>
					with the ruler's consecration<br/>
					by the rulers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But it does not occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder<br/>
					will the rulers anoint me<br/>
					with the rider's consecration?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The longing for consecration<br/>
					which he had when he was unanointed<br/>
					has utterly ceased in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br/>
					'a person that has done with longings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three persons<br/>
					that are seen to exist in the world</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks,<br/>
					these three sorts of monks<br/>
					are seen to exist in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one that longs not,<br/>
					the one that longs,<br/>
					and the one that has done with longings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person that longs not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one is immoral,<br/>
					an evil-doer,<br/>
					impure,<br/>
					of suspicious behaviour,<br/>
					of covert deeds.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He is no recluse,<br/>
					though he pretends to be:<br/>
					no liver of the righteous life,<br/>
					though he claims to be:<br/>
					rotten within and full of lusts,<br/>
					a rubbish heap of filth is he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such a monk,<br/>
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					has himself in this very life<br/>
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br/>
					and release by insight,<br/>
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But it never occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder shall I,<br/>
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					myself in this very life<br/>
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br/>
					and release by insight,<br/>
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abide therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br/>
					'a person that longs not.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person that longs?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion we have a monk<br/>
					who is moral<br/>
					and of a lovely nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such a monk,<br/>
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					has himself in this very life<br/>
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br/>
					and release by insight,<br/>
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder shall I,<br/>
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					myself in this very life<br/>
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br/>
					and release by insight,<br/>
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abide therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br/>
					'a person that longs.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person<br/>
					that has done with longings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here we have the arahant,<br/>
					destroyer of the <i>āsavas</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such a monk,<br/>
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					has himself in this very life<br/>
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br/>
					and release by insight,<br/>
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But it never occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder shall I,<br/>
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					myself in this very life<br/>
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br/>
					and re- <span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span> lease by insight,<br/>
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abide therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks,<br/>
					the longing for release<br/>
					which was his when unreleased<br/>
					is now allayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br/>
					'the person that has done with longings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the three persons who are found existing in the world."</p>
