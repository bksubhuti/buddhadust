					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a rajah who is a world-monarch,<br/>
					a just and righteous ruler, -<br/>
					even he is not without a rajah."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At these words a certain monk said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who then, lord, is ruler over a world-monarch,<br/>
					a just and righteous ruler?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dhamma, monk," replied the Exalted One,<br/>
					and went on to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, monk, a rajah who is a world-monarch,<br/>
					a just and righteous ruler,<br/>
					in dependence on Dhamma,<br/>
					honouring Dhamma,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monk, a rajah who is a world-monarch,<br/>
