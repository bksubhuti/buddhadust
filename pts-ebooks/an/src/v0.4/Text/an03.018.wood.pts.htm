					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if Wanderers holding other views should thus question you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it for the sake of rebirth in the Deva-World<br/>
					that Gotama, the ascetic,<br/>
					lives the righteous life?'</p>

					<p class="f4">-thus questioned would ye not be annoyed,<br/>
					distressed<br/>
					or disgusted?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So then, monks,<br/>
					it would seem that ye are annoyed,<br/>
					distressed,<br/>
					disgusted<br/>
					with the idea of deva-life,<br/>
					deva-beauty,<br/>
					the idea of deva-bliss,<br/>
					fame<br/>
					and sovereignty.</p>

					<p class="f4">How much more should ye not be annoyed, distressed, disgusted<br/>
					with the idea of immorality in deed,<br/>
					how much more should ye not be annoyed, distressed, disgusted<br/>
					with the idea of immorality in speech,<br/>
					how much more should ye not be annoyed, distressed, disgusted<br/>
					with the idea of immorality in thought?"</p>
