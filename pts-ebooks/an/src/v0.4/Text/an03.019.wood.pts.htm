					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of three characteristics<br/>
					a shopkeeper is incapable<br/>
					of acquiring wealth he had not before,<br/>
					of holding what he gets,<br/>
					or increasing what he holds.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the shopkeeper<br/>
					at early dawn attends not closely to his work,<br/>
					at midday attends not closely to his work,<br/>
					at eventide attends not closely to his work.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three characteristics<br/>
					possessed of which<br/>
					a shopkeeper is incapable<br/>
					of acquiring wealth he had not before,<br/>
					of holding what he gets,<br/>
					or increasing what he holds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[100]</b></span> Just so, monks, possessed of three characteristics<br/>
					a monk is incapable of acquiring a state of profit,<br/>
					of holding it when gotten<br/>
					or increasing a state of profit when he gets it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

						

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks,<br/>
					at early dawn the monk does not concentrate on the mark<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of his meditation exercise,<br/>
					at midday he does not concentrate on the mark of his meditation exercise,<br/>
					at eventide he does not concentrate on the mark of his meditation exercise.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is owing to these three characteristics that he is incapable of acquiring a state of profit,<br/>
					of holding it when gotten<br/>
					or increasing a state of profit when he gets it.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>
