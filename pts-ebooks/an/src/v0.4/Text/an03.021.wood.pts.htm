					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Saviṭṭha<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> and Koṭṭhita the Great<br/>
					went to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					and on coming to him greeted him courteously.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having greeted him courteously,<br/>
					they took a seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side,<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta said this to the venerable Saviṭṭha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend Saviṭṭha, there are these three persons to be found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">One who has testified to the truth with body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					one who has won view,<br/>
					and one released by faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three persons to be found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now sir, of these three<br/>
					which seems to you most excellent and choice?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, reverend Sāriputta,<br/>
					there are these three persons to be found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these three<br/>
					I prefer the one released by faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because in this one<br/>
					the faculty of faith is most developed."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					asked the same question<br/>
					of the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great, who replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">"To me the one who has testified to the truth with body<br/>
					seems most excellent and choice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because in this one<br/>
					the faculty of concentration is most developed."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great<br/>
					asked the same question<br/>
					of the venerable Sāriputta, who replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend Koṭṭhita, there are these three persons<br/>
					to be found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these three he who has won view<br/>
					seems to me the most excellent and choice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, sir, in this one<br/>
					the faculty of insight is most developed."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the venerable Sāriputta to the two others:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, sirs, we have all three<br/>
					expressed our views<br/>
					according to our several leanings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose we go together<br/>
					to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him let us tell him <span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span> of this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">According as the Exalted One shall decide it,<br/>
					so will we uphold."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, sir," said the other two<br/>
					to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">So all three went to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Sāriputta told the Exalted One<br/>
					<i>[all the talk they had had on the subject].</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is no easy matter, Sāriputta,<br/>
					to decide off-hand<br/>
					which of these three persons<br/>
					is the most excellent and choice.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may well be that this person<br/>
					who is released by faith<br/>
					is on the path to arahantship;<br/>
					that this one who has testified to the truth with body<br/>
					is a once-returner or a non-returner;<br/>
					that this one who has won view<br/>
					is also a once-returner or a non-returner.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is no easy thing, Sāriputta,<br/>
					to decide off-hand about this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may well be that this person<br/>
					who has testified to the truth with body<br/>
					is on the path to arahantship;<br/>
					that the other two are once-returners or non-returners.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or again it may well be that this person<br/>
					who has won view<br/>
					is on the path to arahantship;<br/>
					while the two others are once-returners or non-returners.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed it is no easy task, Sāriputta,<br/>
					to decide off-hand which of these three persons<br/>
					is most excellent and choice."</p>
