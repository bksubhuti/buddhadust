					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons<br/>
					are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a person who is to be shunned as loathsome,<br/>
					not to <span class="f2 g"><b>[109]</b></span> be followed,<br/>
					served<br/>
					and honoured.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a person who is to be regarded with indifference,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					not to be followed,<br/>
					served<br/>
					and honoured.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a person who is to be followed,<br/>
					served<br/>
					and honoured.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what sort, monks, is the one<br/>
					who is to be shunned?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person is immoral,<br/>
					an evil-doer,<br/>
					impure,<br/>
					of suspicious behaviour,<br/>
					of covert deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is no recluse,<br/>
					though he pretends to be one:<br/>
					he is no liver of the righteous life,<br/>
					though he pretends to be:<br/>
					rotten within<br/>
					and full of lusts,<br/>
					a rubbish-heap of filth is he.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, monks,<br/>
					is to be shunned as loathsome,<br/>
					not to be followed,<br/>
					served<br/>
					and honoured.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, even though one do not profess adherence<br/>
					to the views of such a man,<br/>
					nevertheless an ill report<br/>
					spreads abroad about one,<br/>
					that he is a man who associates with evil-doers,<br/>
					a man who has bad friends,<br/>
					one who consorts with the wicked.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, suppose a snake<br/>
					goes into a dunghill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he does not bite<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					(the one who takes him out),<br/>
					yet he befouls him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, monks,<br/>
					though one do not profess adherence<br/>
					to the views of such a man,<br/>
					nevertheless an ill report<br/>
					spreads abroad about one,<br/>
					that he is a man who associates with evil-doers,<br/>
					a man who has bad friends,<br/>
					one who consorts with the wicked.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks,<br/>
					such an one is to be shunned as loathsome,<br/>
					not to be followed,<br/>
					served<br/>
					and honoured.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>


					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the person who is to be treated with indifference?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>
					is irritable and turbulent.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When anything,<br/>
					however trifling,<br/>
					is said to him<br/>
					he becomes enraged,<br/>
					gets angry and quarrelsome:<br/>
					he resents it,<br/>
					and displays anger,<br/>
					hatred<br/>
					and sulkiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when a festering sore,<br/>
					if struck by a stick or sherd,<br/>
					discharges matter all the more,<br/>
					even so a certain person<br/>
					is irritable and turbulent.</p>

					<p class="f4">When anything,<br/>
					however trifling,<br/>
					is said to him<br/>
					he becomes enraged,<br/>
					gets angry and quarrelsome:<br/>
					he resents it,<br/>
					and displays anger,<br/>
					hatred<br/>
					and sulkiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a firebrand of tinduka<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> wood,<br/>
					if struck <span class="f2 g"><b>[110]</b></span> by a stick or sherd,<br/>
					fizzles and sputters all the more,<br/>
					even so a certain person<br/>
					is irritable and turbulent.</p>

					<p class="f4">When anything,<br/>
					however trifling,<br/>
					is said to him<br/>
					he becomes enraged,<br/>
					gets angry and quarrelsome:<br/>
					he resents it,<br/>
					and displays anger,<br/>
					hatred<br/>
					and sulkiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a cesspit<br/>
					stirred with a stick or sherd<br/>
					gives out a stench<br/>
					more noisome than before,<br/>
					even so a certain person<br/>
					is irritable and turbulent.</p>

					<p class="f4">When anything,<br/>
					however trifling,<br/>
					is said to him<br/>
					he becomes enraged,<br/>
					gets angry and quarrelsome:<br/>
					he resents it,<br/>
					and displays anger,<br/>
					hatred<br/>
					and sulkiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a person, monks,<br/>
					is to be regarded with indifference<br/>
					not to be followed,<br/>
					served<br/>
					and honoured.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because one thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He might curse me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"He might abuse me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"He might do me some injury."</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks,<br/>
					such a person is to be treated with indifference,<br/>
					he is not to be followed,<br/>
					served<br/>
					and honoured.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the person who is to be followed,<br/>
					served<br/>
					and honoured?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case<br/>
					a certain person is virtuous,<br/>
					of a lovely nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one should be followed,<br/>
					served<br/>
					and honoured.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, although one may not profess<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> adherence to his views,<br/>
					yet a fair report spreads abroad<br/>
					that one is a man who associates with the lovely,<br/>
					a man who has worthy friends,<br/>
					a man who consorts with the worthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore such an one is to be followed,<br/>
					served<br/>
					and honoured.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the three persons<br/>
					found existing in the world.</p>
