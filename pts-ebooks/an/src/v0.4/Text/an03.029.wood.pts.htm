					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three persons<br/>
					found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The blind,<br/>
					the one-eyed,<br/>
					the two-eyed.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the blind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br/>
					has not the eye to acquire wealth unattained,<br/>
					or to make the wealth he has increase.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has not the eye<br/>
					fit to see states that are good and bad,<br/>
					to see states that are blameworthy and praiseworthy,<br/>
					states mean and exalted,<br/>
					states resembling light and darkness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called 'the blind.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the one-eyed?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person has the eye to acquire wealth unattained,<br/>
					and to make the wealth he has increase,<br/>
					but has not the eye<br/>
					to see states that are good and bad,<br/>
					to see states that are blameworthy and praiseworthy,<br/>
					states mean and exalted,<br/>
					states resembling light and darkness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one is called 'the one-eyed.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span> And of what sort, monks, is the two-eyed?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person has both<br/>
					the eye to acquire wealth unattained<br/>
					and the eye to make the wealth he has increase,<br/>
					and the eye to see states that are good and bad,<br/>
					to see states that are blameworthy and praiseworthy,<br/>
					states mean and exalted,<br/>
					states resembling light and darkness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one is called 'the two-eyed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three persons<br/>
					found existing in the world."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The blind, of sight bereft, hath no such wealth,<br/>
							Nor works good deeds, unlucky in both ways.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
							And then again 'tis said the one-eyed man,<br/>
							Conjoined<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> with right and wrong, searches for wealth<br/>
							With tricks and fraud and lies: worldly, purse-proud,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
							And clever to gain wealth is he, and hence<br/>
							Departing is afflicted sore in Hell.<br/>
							But best of all's the being with two eyes:<br/>
							His wealth, with right exertion rightly won,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
							He gives away: with best intent, unwavering,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
							In a blessed home he's born, nor sorrows there.<br/>
							So from the blind and one-eyed keep aloof,<br/>
							And join thyself to worthy two-eyed man.</p>
