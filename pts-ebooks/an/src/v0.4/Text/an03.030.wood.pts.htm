					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three persons<br/>
					found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The topsy-turvy-brained,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					the scatter-brained,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[113]</b></span> And of what sort, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br/>
					frequents the monastery<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					to hear Dhamma from the lips of the monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">The monks teach him Dhamma<br/>
					that is lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely in the ending,<br/>
					both in spirit<br/>
					and in letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">They make plain the holy life<br/>

					<p class="f4">Just as when a pot is turned upside down,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

							He, oft and oft resorting to the monks,<br/>
							Hears all their talk, beginning, middle, end,<br/>
							And, while he sits, can grasp the letter of it:<br/>
							But, rising from his seat, misunderstands,<br/>
							Forgetting even what he grasped before.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Better the man of comprehensive brain.<br/>

							Keeps it, with best intent, unwavering,<br/>
							In Dhamma skilled and what conforms thereto.<br/>
							This is the man to make an end of Ill.</p>
