					<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="f4"><b>(a)</b></span> Ānanda</h3>

					

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[115]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"May it be, lord, that a monk can acquire such concentration<br/>
					that in this body, together with its consciousness,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					he has no notion of 'I' or 'mine,'<br/>
					or any tendency to vain conceit:<br/>
					that likewise in all external objects<br/>
					he has no such <span class="f2 g"><b>[116]</b></span> notion or tendency:<br/>
					may it be that he can so abide<br/>
					in the attainment of release of the heart,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					that he has no such notion or tendency?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It may be so, Ānanda that a monk can acquire such concentration<br/>
					that in this body, together with its consciousness,<br/>
					he has no notion of 'I' or 'mine,'<br/>
					or any tendency to vain conceit:<br/>
					that likewise in all external objects<br/>
					he has no such notion or tendency:<br/>
					it may be that he can so abide<br/>
					in the attainment of release of the heart,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					that he has no such notion or tendency."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, by what process can it be<br/>
					that a monk can acquire such concentration<br/>
					that in this body, together with its consciousness,<br/>
					he has no notion of 'I' or 'mine,'<br/>
					or any tendency to vain conceit:<br/>
					that likewise in all external objects<br/>
					he has no such notion or tendency:<br/>
					that it may be that he can so abide<br/>
					in the attainment of release of the heart,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					that he has no such notion or tendency?"</p>

					<p class="f4">In this matter, Ānanda, a monk has this idea:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the calm,<br/>
					this is the excellent state, to wit,<br/>
					— rest from all activities,<br/>
					the forsaking of all substrate (of rebirth),<br/>
					the destruction of craving,<br/>
					passionlessness,<br/>
					making to cease,<br/>
					Nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk can acquire such concentration<br/>
					that in this body, together with its consciousness,<br/>
					he has no notion of 'I' or 'mine,'<br/>
					or any tendency to vain conceit:<br/>
					that likewise in all external objects<br/>
					he has no such notion or tendency:<br/>
					that it may be that he can so abide<br/>
					in the attainment of release of the heart,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					that he has no such notion or tendency.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Ānanda, in this connexion<br/>
					I thus spoke in the Chapter on the Goal<br/>
					in (the sutta called) The Questions of Puṇṇaka:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'By searching in the world things high and low,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
							He who hath nought<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> to stir him in the world,<br/>
							Calm and unclouded, cheerful, freed of longing,<br/>
							He hath crossed over birth and eld, I say.'"</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>


					<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="f4"><b>(b)</b></span> Sāriputta</h3>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta went to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sāriputta, I may teach Dhamma in brief,<br/>
					and again I may teach it in detail,<br/>
					and I may teach it both in brief and in detail.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is those who understand that are hard to find."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the time, O Wellfarer,<br/>
					for the Exalted One to teach Dhamma in brief,<br/>
					in detail<br/>
					and in both ways!</p>

					<p class="f4">There will be those who will understand Dhamma."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Sāriputta, you must train yourself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In this body together with its consciousness,<br/>
					there shall be no notion of "I" and "mine,"<br/>
					no tendency to vain conceit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise in all external objects<br/>
					there shall be no such notion or tendency.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will so abide in the attainment of the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					that we have no notion of "I" and "mine,"<br/>
					no tendency to vain conceit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how you must train yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">In so far as a monk has no notion of 'I' and 'mine,'<br/>
					no tendency to vain conceit,<br/>
					likewise in all external objects<br/>
					has no such notion or tendency,<br/>
					and he abides the attainment of the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					he is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A monk who has cut off craving,<br/>
					broken the bond:<br/>
					one who, by perfect comprehension of conceit,<br/>
					has made an end of Ill.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, in this connexion, Sāriputta,<br/>
					I spoke in the chapter on The Goal<br/>
					in (the sutta called) The Questions of Udaya:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'The abandoning of lust<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> and grief,<br/>
							Both these, and sloth's destruction,<br/>
							Restraint of mental restlessness<br/>
							And pure tranquillity of mind<br/>
							And lawful thoughts in equipoise, —<br/>
							"Release by knowledge" this I deem<br/>
							And "breaking up of ignorance.'"</p>
