					<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Of Āḷavī<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h3>

					

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Āḷavī,<br/>
					at Cowpath in Siṅsapa Grove,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					lodging on the leaf-strewn ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Hatthaka of Āḷavī<br/>
					was wandering there afoot,<br/>
					and as he went along<br/>
					he saw the Exalted One in that place,<br/>
					seated on the ground strewn with leaves.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing him he approached<br/>
					and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated Hatthakka of Āḷavī<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, does the Exalted One live happily?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, my lad, I live happily.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one of those who live happily in the world."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, sir, the winter nights are cold,<br/>
					the dark half of the month<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is the time of snowfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hard is the ground<br/>
					trampled <span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span> by the hoofs of cattle,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					thin the carpet of fallen leaves,<br/>
					sparse are the leaves of the tree,<br/>
					cold are the saffron robes<br/>
					and cold the gale of wind that blows."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Still, my lad,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					I live happily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of those who live happy in the world<br/>
					I am one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, my lad,<br/>
					I will question you about this<br/>
					and do you reply as you think fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, my lad?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a housefather or housefather's son<br/>
					has a house with a gabled roof,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					plastered inside and out,<br/>
					with well-fitting doors and casements.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein is a couch<br/>
					spread with a long-fleeced woolen rug,<br/>
					a bed-spread of white wool,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					a coverlet embroidered with flowers,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>
					spread with a costly skin of antelope,<br/>
					having a canopy overhead<br/>
					and a scarlet cushion at each end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is a lamp burning<br/>
					and four wives to wait upon him<br/>
					with all their charms.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, my lad?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would he live happily or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">How think you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, he would, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one of those<br/>
					who live happily in the world."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Well now, my lad,<br/>
					what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would there not arise<br/>
					in that housefather or housefather's son<br/>
					torments of body or of mind<br/>
					that are born of lust<br/>
					so that, tortured by them,<br/>
					he would live unhappily?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They would arise, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, my lad,<br/>
					as to those torments of body or of mind<br/>
					born of lust,<br/>
					tortured by which he would live unhappily,<br/>
					that lust has been abandoned by the Tathāgata,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made unable to become again,<br/>
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why I live happily.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span> Again, would there not arise<br/>
					in that housefather or housefather's son<br/>
					torments of body or of mind<br/>
					that are born of malice<br/>
					so that, tortured by them,<br/>
					he would live unhappily?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They would arise, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, my lad, as to those torments of body or of mind<br/>
					born of malice,<br/>
					tortured by which he would live unhappily,<br/>
					that malice has been abandoned by the Tathāgata,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made unable to become again,<br/>
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why I live happily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, would not there arise<br/>
					in that housefather or housefather's son<br/>
					torments of body or of mind<br/>
					that are born of delusion<br/>
					so that, tortured by them,<br/>
					he would live unhappily?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They would arise, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, my lad, as to those torments of body or of mind<br/>
					born of delusion,<br/>
					tortured by which he would live unhappily,<br/>
					that delusion has been abandoned by the Tathāgata,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made unable to become again,<br/>
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why I live happily."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Yea, happily he lives, the Brāhman<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> set free<br/>
							Whom lusts defile not, who is cooled and loosed from bonds,<br/>
							Who hath all barriers burst, restraining his heart's pain.<br/>
							Happy the calm one lives who wins the peace of mind.'</p>
