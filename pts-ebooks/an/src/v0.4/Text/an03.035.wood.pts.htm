					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three deva-messengers.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion<br/>

					he is reborn in the Waste,<br/>
					the Way of Woe,<br/>
					the Downfall,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the warders of Purgatory<br/>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me act nobly in deed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then the other says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, sire, I could not.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I was negligent.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, this Great Hell<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> (is thus described):</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Once upon a time, monks,<br/>

					thus suffer retribution.</p>

					<p class="f4">O that I could win birth<br/>

					<p class="f4">O that a Tāthagata<br/>
					were born into the world,<br/>
					an Arahant<br/>
					who is a Fully Enlightened One!</p>

					<p class="f4">O that I might sit at the feet<br/>
					of that Exalted One<br/>
					and then that Exalted One would teach me Dhamma,<br/>
					and then I might learn Dhamma<br/>
					from that Exalted One!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I say this,<br/>
					not hearing it from some recluse or brahmin;<br/>
					nay, but what I myself have known<br/>
					and seen<br/>
					and heard,<br/>
					that do I declare unto you."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">They who, by deva-messengers tho' warned,<br/>
							Are proudly<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> careless and indifferent,<br/>
							Born in a mean estate, must suffer long.<br/>
							Good men, by deva-messengers when warned,<br/>
							Are never slothful in the Ariyan Dhamma;<br/>
							Seeing the risk of clinging to this world,<br/>
							Knowing it for the cause of birth and death,<br/>
							By ending birth and death, freed utterly,<br/>
							They have won calm, those happy ones,<br/>
							Have won Nibbāna in this very life:<br/>
