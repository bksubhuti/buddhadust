					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, on the eighth day<br/>
					of the lunar half-month<br/>
					the ministers who are councillors<br/>
					of the Four Great Kings<br/>
					perambulate this world<br/>
					to see whether many folk among men<br/>
					pay reverence to mother and father,<br/>
					to recluses and brahmins;<br/>
					and show deference to the elders of the clan,<br/>
					observe the Sabbath,<br/>
					keep the vigil<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					and do good works.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the fourteenth day<br/>
					(of the lunar half-month)<br/>
					the sons of the Four Great Kings<br/>
					perambulate this world<br/>
					to see whether many folk among men<br/>
					pay reverence to mother and father,<br/>
					to recluses and brahmins;<br/>
					and show deference to the elders of the clan,<br/>
					observe the Sabbath,<br/>
					keep the vigil<br/>
					and do good works.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the fifteenth day,<br/>
					that day<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> which is the Sabbath,<br/>
					the Four Great Kings in person<br/>
					perambulate this world<br/>
					to see whether many folk among men<br/>
					pay reverence to mother and father,<br/>
					to recluses and brahmins;<br/>
					and show deference to the elders of the clan,<br/>
					observe the Sabbath,<br/>
					keep the vigil<br/>
					and do good works.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, if few be those among men<br/>
					pay reverence to mother and father,<br/>
					to recluses and brahmins;<br/>
					and show deference to the elders of the clan,<br/>
					observe the Sabbath,<br/>
					keep the vigil<br/>
					and do good works,<br/>
					the Four Great Kings<br/>
					report the matter to the Devas of the Thirty-Three,<br/>
					as they sit in conclave<br/>
					in the Hall of Righteousness,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good my lords,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					few among men<br/>
					pay reverence to mother and father,<br/>
					to recluses and brahmins;<br/>
					and show deference to the elders of the clan,<br/>
					observe the Sabbath,<br/>
					keep the vigil<br/>
					and do good works.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the Devas of the Thirty-Three<br/>
					are displeased and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, sirs,<br/>
					the Deva-hosts will diminish<br/>
					and the Asura-hosts will be increased.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks,<br/>
					if many are they among men<br/>
					who pay reverence to mother and father,<br/>
					to recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					who show deference to the elders of the clan,<br/>
					who observe the Sabbath,<br/>
					keep the vigil<br/>
					and do good works,<br/>
					then the Four Great Kings<br/>
					report the matter to the Devas of the Thirty-Three,<br/>
					as they sit in conclave<br/>
					in the Hall of Righteousness, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good my lords,<br/>
					many are they among men<br/>
					who pay reverence to mother and father,<br/>
					to recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					who show deference to the elders of the clan,<br/>
					who observe the Sabbath,<br/>
					keep the vigil<br/>
					and do good works.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span> Thereat, monks, the Devas of the Thirty-Three are glad and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, sirs,<br/>
					the Deva-hosts will be increased<br/>
					and the Asura-hosts will decrease.'"</p>
