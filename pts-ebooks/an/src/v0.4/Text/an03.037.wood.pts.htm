					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, monks, Sakka, lord of the Devas,<br/>
					was instructing<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Devas of the Thirty-Three,<br/>
					and on that ocoasion uttered this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'He who would be like unto me should keep<br/>
							The fourteenth, fifteenth day and eke the eighth<br/>
							Of the half-month, likewise the extra fast,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
							To observance of the precepts eight well given.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, this verse was ill sung,<br/>
					not well sung<br/>
					by Sakka, lord of the Devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was wrongly,<br/>
					not rightly uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">How so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, Sakka, lord of the Devas,<br/>
					was not rid of passion,<br/>
					not rid of malice,<br/>
					not rid of delusion:<br/>
					whereas a monk who is arahant,<br/>
					one in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br/>
					who has lived the life,<br/>
					done what was to be done,<br/>
					who has laid down the burden,<br/>
					attained his own welfare,<br/>
					utterly destroyed the fetter of becoming,<br/>
					who is perfectly released by knowledge, -<br/>
					by such an one this saying of:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'He who would be like unto me should keep<br/>
							The fourteenth, fifteenth day and eke the eighth<br/>
							Of the half-month, likewise the extra fast,<br/>
							To observance of the precepts eight well given.'</p>

					<p class="f4">were fitly uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that monk is rid of passion,<br/>
					rid of malice,<br/>
					rid of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, monks, Sakka,<br/>
					lord of the Devas,<br/>
					was instructing the Devas of the Thirty-Three,<br/>

					<p class="f4">It was wrongly,<br/>
					not rightly uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">How so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, Sakka, lord of the Devas,<br/>
					was not released from birth,<br/>
					old age<br/>
					and death,<br/>
					from sorrow,<br/>
					lamentation<br/>
					and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span> He was not released<br/>

					<p class="f4">He was not released from Ill,<br/>
					I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">were fitly uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that monk is fully released from birth,<br/>
					old age<br/>
					and death,<br/>
					from sorrow,<br/>
					lamentation<br/>
