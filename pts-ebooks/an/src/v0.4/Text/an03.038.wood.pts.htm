					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I was delicately nurtured,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					exceeding delicately nurtured,<br/>
					delicately nurtured beyond measure.</p>

					<p class="f4">For instance,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					in my father's house<br/>
					lotus-pools were made thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">one of blue lotuses,<br/>
					one of red lotuses,<br/>
					another of white lotuses,<br/>
					just for my benefit.</p>

					<p class="f4">No sandal-wood powder did I use<br/>
					that was not from Kasi:<br/>
					of Kasi cloth was my turban made:<br/>
					of Kasi cloth was my jacket,<br/>
					my tunic<br/>
					and my cloak.</p>

					<p class="f4">By night and day<br/>
					a white canopy was held over me,<br/>
					lest cold or heat,<br/>
					dust or chaff<br/>
					or dew,<br/>
					should touch me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks,<br/>
					I had three palaces:<br/>
					one for winter,<br/>
					one for summer,<br/>
					and one for the rainy season.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In the four months of the rains<br/>
					I was waited on by minstrels,<br/>
					women all of them.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I came not down from my palace<br/>
					in those months.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, whereas in other men's homes<br/>
					broken rice<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> together with sour gruel<br/>
					is given as food to slave-servants,<br/>
					in my father's home<br/>
					they were given rice,<br/>
					meat<br/>
					and milk-rice<br/>
					for their food.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, monks,<br/>
					thus blest with much prosperity,<br/>
					thus <span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span> nurtured with exceeding delicacy,<br/>
					this thought occurred:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely one of the uneducated manyfolk,<br/>
					though himself subject to old age and decay,<br/>
					not having passed beyond old age and decay,<br/>
					when he sees another broken down with age,<br/>
					is troubled,<br/>
					ashamed,<br/>
					disgusted,<br/>
					forgetful that he himself is such an one.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now I too am subject to old age and decay,<br/>
					not having passed beyond old age and decay.</p>

					<p class="f4">Were I to see another broken down with old age,<br/>
					I might be troubled,<br/>
					ashamed<br/>
					and disgusted.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would not be seemly in me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, -<br/>
					as I considered the matter,<br/>
					all pride in my youth deserted me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'One of the uneducated many-folk,<br/>
					though himself subject to disease,<br/>
					not having passed beyond disease,<br/>
					when he sees another person diseased,<br/>
					is troubled,<br/>
					ashamed<br/>
					and disgusted,<br/>
					forgetful that he himself is such an one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I too am subject to disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have not passed beyond disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Were I to see another diseased,<br/>
					I might be troubled,<br/>
					ashamed,<br/>
					disgusted.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would not be seemly in me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, as I considered the matter,<br/>
					all pride in my health deserted me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'One of the uneducated manyfolk,<br/>
					though himself subject to death,<br/>
					not having passed beyond death,<br/>
					when he sees another person subject to death<br/>
					is troubled,<br/>
					disgusted<br/>
					and ashamed,<br/>
					forgetful that he himself is such an one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I too am subject to death.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have not passed beyond death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Were I to see another subject to death,<br/>
					I might be troubled,<br/>
					ashamed,<br/>
					disgusted.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would not be seemly in me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, as I considered the matter,<br/>
					all pride in my life deserted me."</p>
