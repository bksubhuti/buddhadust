					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the inhabitants of a village or suburb<br/>
					where virtuous hermits dwell for their support<br/>
					beget much merit in three ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">In deed,<br/>
					word<br/>
					and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three ways<br/>
					the inhabitants of a village or suburb<br/>
					where virtuous hermits dwell for their support<br/>
					beget much merit."</p>
