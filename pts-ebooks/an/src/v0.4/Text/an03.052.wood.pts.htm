					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now two broken-down old brahmins,<br/>
					aged,<br/>
					far gone in years,<br/>
					who had reached life's end,<br/>
					one hundred and twenty years of age,<br/>
					came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him they saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they sat at one side those brahmins said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We are brahmins, master Gotama,<br/>
					old brahmins,<br/>
					aged,<br/>
					far gone in years,<br/>
					who have reached life's end,<br/>
					one hundred and twenty years of age,<br/>
					but we have done no noble deeds,<br/>
					no meritorious deeds,<br/>
					no deeds that can bring assurance to our fears.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Gotama cheer us!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Gotama comfort us,<br/>
					so that it may be a profit<br/>
					and a blessing to us<br/>
					for a long time!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed you brahmins are old,<br/>
					aged,<br/>
					far gone in years,<br/>
					who have reached life's end,<br/>
					one hundred and twenty years of age,<br/>
					but you have done no noble deeds,<br/>
					no meritorious deeds,<br/>
					no deeds that can bring assurance to your fears.</p>

					<p class="f4">All ablaze, brahmins, is this world<br/>
					with old age,<br/>
					sickness<br/>
					and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since this is so,<br/>
					self-restraint in body,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and thought<br/>
					(practised) in this life: -<br/>
					let this be refuge,<br/>
					cave of shelter,<br/>
					island of defence,<br/>
					resting-place<br/>
					and support<br/>
					one's comfort in the life to come.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When a house is burning, goods removed therefrom,<br/>
							Not what are burned, will be of use to him<br/>
							Who doth remove them. So the world is burned<br/>
							By eld and death. Then save thyself by giving.<br/>
							What's given is well saved.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The self-restraint of body, speech and thought<br/>
							In this life practised, meritorious deeds,<br/>
							These make for happiness when one is dead.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The gāthās are at <i>JA.</i> iii, 471 = <i>S.</i> i, 31 (<i>K.S.</i> i, 42). Text and <i>Comy.</i> read <i>sunīhataṃ,</i> <i>JA.</i> and <i>Comy.</i> <i>nībhataṃ.</i></p>
