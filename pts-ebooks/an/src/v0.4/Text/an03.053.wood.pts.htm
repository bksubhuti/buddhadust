					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> brahmin came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to the saying</p>

					<p class="f4">'Seen in this life<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is Dhamma,'</p>

					<p class="f4">master Gotama,<br/>
					pray how far is Dhamma seen in this life?</p>

					<p class="f4">How far is it a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be realized for themselves<br/>
					by the wise?"</p>
