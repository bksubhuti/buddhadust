					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Jānussoṇi,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the brahmin, came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Seen in this life is Nibbāna'</p>

					<p class="f4">is the saying, master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, master Gotama, how far is Nibbāna seen in this life?</p>

					<p class="f4">How far is it a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be realized for themselves<br/>
					by the wise?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahmin, one who is ablaze with lust,<br/>
					overwhelmed with lust,<br/>

					he no longer practises wickedness in act,<br/>
