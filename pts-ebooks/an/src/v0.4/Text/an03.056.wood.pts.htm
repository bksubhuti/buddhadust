					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain brahmin of great wealth came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span> "Master Gotama, I have beard the saying<br/>
					of brahmins of olden days,<br/>
					men aged,<br/>
					far gone in years,<br/>
					themselves the teachers of teachers,<br/>
					that once upon a time<br/>
					this world was in truth so crowded with people, -<br/>
					one might think it to be the Waveless Deep,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					that villages,<br/>
					suburbs<br/>
					and royal cities<br/>
					were close enough for a cock to walk from one to another.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, master Gotama,<br/>
					what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					of the apparent loss and decrease<br/>
					of human beings?</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that villages are no longer villages,<br/>
					suburbs no longer suburbs,<br/>
					towns no longer towns,<br/>
					and districts are depopulated?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, brahmin,<br/>
					people are ablaze with unlawful lusts,<br/>
					overwhelmed by depraved longings,<br/>
					obsessed by wrong doctrines.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus ablaze,<br/>
					overwhelmed<br/>
					and obsessed<br/>
					they seize sharp knives<br/>
					and take each other's lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many men come by their end.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin, is the reason,<br/>
					that is the cause<br/>
					of the apparent loss and decrease<br/>
					of human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why villages are no longer villages,<br/>
					suburbs no longer suburbs,<br/>
					towns no longer towns,<br/>
					and districts are depopulated.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, brahmin,<br/>
					since folk are ablaze with unlawful lusts,<br/>
					overwhelmed by depraved longings,<br/>
					obsessed by wrong doctrines,<br/>
					on such as these<br/>
					the sky rains not down steadily.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is hard to get a meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">The crops are bad,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					afflicted with mildew<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					and grown to mere stubs.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly many come <span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span> by their end.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin, is the reason,<br/>
					that is the cause<br/>
					of the apparent loss and decrease<br/>
					of human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why villages are no longer villages,<br/>
					suburbs no longer suburbs,<br/>
					towns no longer towns,<br/>
					and districts are depopulated.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, brahmin, since folk are ablaze with unlawful lusts,<br/>
					overwhelmed by depraved longings,<br/>
					obsessed by wrong doctrines,<br/>
					on such miscreants<br/>
					the Yakkhas loose non-human monsters.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby many come by their end.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is the reason,<br/>
					this is the cause<br/>
					of the apparent loss and decrease<br/>
					of human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why villages are no longer villages,<br/>
					suburbs no longer suburbs,<br/>
					towns no longer towns,<br/>
					and districts are depopulated."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, master Gotama!<br/>
					Excellent, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br/>
					or shows forth what is hidden,<br/>
					or points out the way to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or holds up a light in the darkness,<br/>
					that they who have eyes ay see objects, —<br/>
					even so in divers ways<br/>
					hath the Norm been set forth by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, master Gotama,<br/>
					do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama,<br/>
					to Dhamma<br/>
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama<br/>
					accept me as a lay-follower<br/>
					from this day forth<br/>
					so long as life shall last,<br/>
					as one who has taken refuge in him."</p>
