					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Jāṇussoṇi,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the brahmin, came to see the Exalted One..</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, he who has a sacrifice to make,<br/>
					or an offering to the dead,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					or a gift of barley in milk,<br/>
					or a gift fit for mendicants,<br/>
					should give it to those brahmins<br/>
					who are possessors of the threefold lore."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, brahmin,<br/>
					how do brahmins describe one<br/>
					who has the threefold lore?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, master Gotama,<br/>
					a brahmin is well born on both sides,<br/>
					of pure descent from mother and father<br/>
					as far back as seven generations,<br/>
					unsmirched,<br/>
					without reproach in respect of birth,<br/>
					one given to study,<br/>
					one who knows the charms by heart,<br/>
					a past master in the three Vedas,<br/>
					the indexes together with the ritual,<br/>
					the treatise on phonology (as fourth)<br/>
					and the legendary sayings (as fifth):<br/>
					he is a man learned in the idioms<br/>
					and the grammar,<br/>
					one perfect in the science of world-speculation<br/>
					and the signs of the great being.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, master Gotama,<br/>
					is how the brahmins describe<br/>
					a brahmin who has the threefold lore."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, brahmin, this description<br/>
					of a brahmin who has the threefold lore is one thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">The description of him who has the threefold lore<br/>
					in the discipline of the Ariyan<br/>
					is quite another thing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, master Gotama,<br/>
					is one the possessor of the threefold lore<br/>
					in the discipline of the Ariyan?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for me if the worthy Gotama would teach me<br/>
					according to what method he is so possessed!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, brahmin, do you listen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind attentively.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, master,"<br/>
					replied Jāṇussoṇi the brahmin to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein a monk, aloof from sensuality,<br/>
					aloof from evil states,<br/>
					enters on the first musing<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of solitude,<br/>
					zestful<br/>
					and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					he enters on that inward calm,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of mind,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful<br/>
					and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second musing,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					he abides indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences ease through the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having entered on the third musing,<br/>
					which the Ariyans describe in these terms:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He who is indifferent and mindful dwells happily,' -</p>

					<p class="f4">he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the abandoning of ease,<br/>
					by the abandoning of discomfort,<br/>
					by the ending of the happiness and unhappiness<br/>
					that he had before,<br/>
					entering on that state<br/>
					which is neither pleasant nor painful,<br/>
					that utter purity of mindfulness<br/>
					reached by indifference,<br/>
					which is the fourth musing,<br/>
					he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then, with mind thus composed,<br/>
					made pure and translucent,<br/>
					stainless and with its taints vanished away,<br/>
					made pliant and workable,<br/>
					fixed and unperturbed,<br/>
					(applies and) bends down his mind<br/>
					to acquiring knowledge of his former births.</p>

					<p class="f4">In divers ways he recalls his former births, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br/>
					two births,<br/>
					three, four, five,<br/>
					ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,<br/>
					a hundred,<br/>
					a thousand,<br/>
					a hundred thousand births:<br/>
					the various destructions of aeons,<br/>
					the various renewals of aeons,<br/>
					both the destructions and renewals of aeons, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I lived there,<br/>
					was named thus,<br/>
					was of such a clan,<br/>
					of such a caste,<br/>
					was thus supported,<br/>
					had such and such pleasant and painful experiences,<br/>
					had such length of days,<br/>
					disappeared thence<br/>
					and arose elsewhere:<br/>
					there too I lived,<br/>
					was named thus,<br/>
					was of such a clan,<br/>
					of such a caste,<br/>
					was thus supported,<br/>
					had such and such pleasant and painful experiences,<br/>
					had such length of days,<br/>
					disappeared thence<br/>
					and arose elsewhere.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he calls to mind<br/>
					in all their specific details,<br/>
					in all their characteristics,<br/>
					in many various ways,<br/>
					his previous states of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first knowledge be attains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance has vanished,<br/>
					knowledge arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gone is the darkness,<br/>
					arisen is the light,<br/>
					as it does for one who abides earnest,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and composed in the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then, with mind thus composed,<br/>
					made pure and translucent,<br/>
					stainless and with its taints vanished away,<br/>
					made pliant and workable,<br/>
					fixed and unperturbed,<br/>
					(applies and) bends down his mind<br/>
					to acquiring knowledge of the fall and rise of beings<br/>
					from one existence to another.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the deva-sight,<br/>
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br/>
					he beholds beings deceasing<br/>
					and rising up again,<br/>
					beings both mean and excellent,<br/>
					fair and foul,<br/>
					gone to a happy state,<br/>
					gone to a woeful state<br/>
					according to their deeds<br/>
					(so as to say):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas! these worthies,<br/>
					given to the practice of evil deeds,<br/>
					of evil words,<br/>
					of evil thoughts,<br/>
					scoffing at the Noble Ones,<br/>
					of perverted views<br/>
					and reaping the fruits of their perverted views, -<br/>
					these beings,<br/>
					on the dissolution of body after death<br/>
					arose again in the Waste,<br/>
					the Woeful Way,<br/>
					the Downfall,<br/>
					in Purgatory!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ah, these worthies,<br/>
					given to the practice of good deeds,<br/>
					of good words,<br/>
					of good thoughts,<br/>
					not scoffing at the Noble Ones,<br/>
					but of sound views<br/>
					and reaping the fruits of their sound views, -<br/>
					these beings,<br/>
					on the dissolution of the body after death<br/>
					arose again in the Happy Lot,<br/>
					in the Heaven World.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the deva-sight,<br/>
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br/>
					he beholds beings deceasing<br/>
					and rising up again,<br/>
					beings both mean and excellent,<br/>
					fair and foul,<br/>
					gone to a happy state,<br/>
					gone to a woeful state<br/>
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second knowledge he attains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance has vanished,<br/>
					knowledge arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gone is the darkness,<br/>
					arisen is the light,<br/>
					as it does for one who abides earnest,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and composed in the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then, with mind thus composed,<br/>
					made pure and translucent,<br/>
					stainless and with its taints vanished away,<br/>
					made pliant and workable,<br/>
					fixed and unperturbed,<br/>
					(applies and) bends down his mind<br/>
					to acquiring knowledge of the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is, the truth that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is, the truth that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is, the truth that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ending of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is, the truth that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ending of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These are āsavas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of the āsavas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the destruction of the āsavas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, thus knowing,<br/>
					thus seeing,<br/>
					his mind is released from the asava of sensuality:<br/>
					his mind is released from the asava of becoming,<br/>
					from the asava of nescience.</p>

					<p class="f4">By release comes the knowledge that he is released,<br/>
					so that he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is what I had to do,<br/>
					there is no more for me of this state of things.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third knowledge he attains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance has vanished,<br/>
					knowledge arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gone is the darkness,<br/>
					arisen is the light,<br/>
					as it does for one who abides earnest,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and composed in the self.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'This man with morals and religion blest,<br/>
							Who has the self composed, is tranquillized,<br/>
							With mind subdued, one-pointed, fully calmed.<br/>
							Who knows his former birth, sees heaven and hell,<br/>
							Who hath attained destruction of rebirth,<br/>
							Master of supernormal power, a sage, -<br/>
							If any brahmin hath this threefold lore,<br/>
							That is the one I call "Tevijja-brahmin,"<br/>
							Not one so called by men in empty words.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin,<br/>
					is how one possesses the threefold lore<br/>
					in the discipline of the Ariyan."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, master Gotama,<br/>
					this one is quite different from the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why! master Gotama,<br/>
					he who has the threefold lore of the brahmins<br/>
					is not worth one-sixteenth part<br/>
					of him who has it in the discipline of the Ariyan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, <span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span> master Gotama!<br/>
					Excellent it is, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br/>
					or shows forth what is hidden,<br/>
					or points out the way to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or holds up a light in the darkness,<br/>
					that they who have eyes ay see objects, —<br/>
					even so in divers ways<br/>
					hath the Norm been set forth by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, master Gotama,<br/>
					do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama,<br/>
					to Dhamma<br/>
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama<br/>
					accept me as a lay-follower<br/>
					from this day forth<br/>
					so long as life shall last,<br/>
					as one who has taken refuge in him."</p>
