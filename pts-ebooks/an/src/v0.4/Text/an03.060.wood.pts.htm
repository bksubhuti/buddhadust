					<p><span class="f2">[168]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Saṅgārava,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the brahmin, came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Master Gotama, we brahmins,<br/>
					let me tell you,<br/>
					offer sacrifice<br/>
					and cause others to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, master Gotama<br/>
					whoso offers sacrifice<br/>
					or causes others to do so,<br/>
					one and all are proficient<br/>
					in a practice of merit<br/>
					that affects many persons;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					that is,<br/>
					which results from offering sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br/>
					he who goes forth<br/>
					as a Wanderer from this or that family,<br/>
					from the home to the homeless life,<br/>
					tames only the single self,<br/>
					calms only the single self,<br/>
					leads to Nibbāna<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					only the single self.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what I say is,<br/>
					thus he is proficient in a practice of merit<br/>
					that affects only one person,<br/>
					as a result of his going forth (as a Wanderer)."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Well, brahmin, as to that I will question you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you answer as you think fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion<br/>
					a Tathāgata arises in the world,<br/>
					an Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					Wellfarer,<br/>
					World-knower,<br/>
					incomparable Charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>
					Teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He says thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come! this is the way,<br/>
					this the practice,<br/>
					proficient in which<br/>
					I make known that incomparable <span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span> bliss<br/>
					which is steeped in the holy life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					by my own powers of comprehension realizing it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come ye also!</p>

					<p class="f4">Practise so that ye too<br/>
					may be proficient therein,<br/>
					so that ye too<br/>
					by your own powers of comprehension<br/>
					may realize it<br/>
					and abide therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this teacher teaches Dhamma<br/>
					and others too practise to attain that end.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover there are many hundreds,<br/>
					many thousands,<br/>
					many hundreds of thousands of such.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">Since this is so,<br/>
					is it a practice of merit<br/>
					affecting only one person<br/>
					or many persons;<br/>
					that is,<br/>
					the result of going forth as a Wanderer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">It affects many persons,<br/>
					this going forth."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. At these words<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said this<br/>
					to the brahmin Saṅgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of these two practices, brahmin,<br/>
					which appeals to you as being the simpler,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					the less troublesome,<br/>
					of greater fruit,<br/>
					profit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br/>
					the brahmin Saṅgārava said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just like the worthy Gotama<br/>
					and the worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					both are to me<br/>
					worthy of honour and praise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said<br/>
					to the brahmin Saṅgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not ask you that, brahmin,<br/>
					as to whom you honour and praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am asking you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Which of the two practices appeals to you<br/>
					as being the simpler<br/>
					and less troublesome,<br/>
					of greater fruit<br/>
					of greater profit?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Again the brahmin Saṅgārava said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just like the worthy Gotama<br/>
					and the worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					both are to me<br/>
					worthy of honour and praise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said<br/>
					to the brahmin Saṅgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not ask you that, brahmin,<br/>
					as to whom you honour and praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am asking you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Which of the two practices appeals to you<br/>
					as being the simpler<br/>
					and less troublesome,<br/>
					of greater fruit<br/>
					of greater profit'"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Again the brahmin Saṅgārava said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just like the worthy Gotama<br/>
					and the worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					both are to me<br/>
					worthy of honour and praise."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[153]</b></span> 3. Thereupon the Exalted One thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even for a third time the brahmin,<br/>
					on being asked a pertinent<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> question by Ānanda,<br/>
					evades<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> it,<br/>
					does not reply to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I release them<br/>
					from their difficulty."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to the brahmin Saṅgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tell me, brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">What was the topic of conversation today<br/>
					when the royal party sat together in company<br/>
					in the rajah's palace?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This was the topic of conversation, master Gotama: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'In former times, you know,<br/>
					monks were fewer in number:<br/>
					but those possessed of supernormal powers<br/>
					being more numerous,<br/>
					they showed the marvel of more-power.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But now it is just the opposite.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That was the topic of conversation today, master Gotama,<br/>
					when the royal party sat together in company<br/>
					in the rajah's palace."</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Now as to that, brahmin,<br/>
					there are these three marvels.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The marvel of more-power,<br/>
					the marvel of thought-reading,<br/>
					the marvel of teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brahmin, is the marvel of more-power?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one enjoys sorts of more-power<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> in divers ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/>
					from being many he becomes one:<br/>
					manifest or invisible<br/>
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/>
					through a rampart,<br/>
					through a mountain,<br/>
					as if through the air:<br/>
					he plunges into the earth<br/>
					and shoots up again<br/>
					as if in water:<br/>
					he walks upon the water<br/>
					without parting it<br/>
					as if on solid ground:<br/>
					he travels through the air<br/>
					sitting crosslegged,<br/>
					like a bird upon the wing:<br/>
					even this moon and sun,<br/>
					though of such mighty power and majesty, -<br/>
					he handles them<br/>
					and strokes them with his hand:<br/>
					even as far as the Brahma <span class="f2 g"><b>[154]</b></span> world<br/>
					he has power with his body.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br/>
					'the marvel of more-power.'</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And what, brahmin,<br/>
					is the marvel of thought-reading?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this case<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> a certain one<br/>
					can declare by means of a sign:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahmin,<br/>
					perhaps a certain one<br/>
					does not declare such things by means of a sign,<br/>
					but he does so after hearing a voice from men<br/>
					or non-humans<br/>
					or from devas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/>
					and says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again, brahmin,<br/>
					perhaps a certain one<br/>
					does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br/>
					or on hearing a voice from men<br/>
					or non-humans<br/>
					or from devas,<br/>
					but he does so (judging) from some sound he has heard,<br/>
					an utterance intelligently made<br/>
					by one who is reasoning intelligently.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So hearing he declares:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span> Then again, brahmin,<br/>
					in this case suppose a certain one<br/>
					does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br/>
					or on hearing a voice from men<br/>
					or non-humans<br/>
					or from devas,<br/>
					or by (judging) from some sound he has heard,<br/>
					an utterance intelligently made<br/>
					by one who is reasoning intelligently<br/>
					yet maybe,<br/>
					when he has attained a state of concentration<br/>
					which is void of thought applied and sustained,<br/>
					one's mind can read another's thoughts<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span><br/>
					and know thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'According to the nature<br/>
					of the thinkings of this worthy,<br/>
					on such and such objects<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span><br/>
					will he immediately<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span> direct his thoughts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br/>
					'the marvel of mind-reading.'</p>

					<p class="f4">6. And what, brahmin,<br/>
					is the marvel of teaching?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one teaches thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reason thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandon this state,<br/>
					acquire that state<br/>
					and abide therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br/>
					'the marvel of teaching.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the three marvels.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now of these three marvels,<br/>
					which appeals to you<br/>
					as the more wonderful and excellent"?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of these marvels, master Gotama,<br/>
					the marvel of more-power —</p>

					<p class="f4">from being one he becomes many,<br/>
					from being many he becomes one:<br/>
					manifest or invisible<br/>
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/>
					through a rampart,<br/>
					through a mountain,<br/>
					as if through the air:<br/>

					even this moon and sun,<br/>
					though of such mighty power and majesty, -<br/>
					he handles them<br/>
					and strokes them with his hand:<br/>
					even as far as the Brahma world<br/>
					he has power with his body —</p>

					<p class="f4">he who performs it has the experience thereof;<br/>
					it is a possession of him who performs it —</p>

					<p class="f4">seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then again as to the marvel of thought-reading —</p>

					<p class="f4">That a certain one<br/>
					can declare by means of a sign:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>
					so it is<br/>
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, though he does not declare such things by means of a sign,<br/>
					but he does so after hearing a voice from men<br/>
					or non-humans<br/>
					or from devas,<br/>
					and says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>

					yet maybe,<br/>

					<p class="f4">also seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as to the marvel of teaching<br/>
					wherein a certain one teaches thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reason thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandon this state,<br/>
					acquire that state<br/>
					and abide therein.' —</p>

					<p class="f4">of these three marvels<br/>
					this one appeals to me<br/>
					as the more wonderful and excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is strange, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful<br/>
					how well the worthy Gotama<br/>
					has spoken of this thing!</p>

					<p class="f4">We do hold the worthy Gotama<br/>
					to possess all three marvels.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the worthy Gotama<br/>
					enjoys sorts of more-power in divers ways, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/>
					from being many he becomes one:<br/>
					manifest or invisible<br/>
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/>
					through a rampart,<br/>

					he handles them<br/>
					and strokes them with his hand:<br/>
					even as far as <span class="f2 g"><b>[156]</b></span> the Brahma world<br/>
					he has power with his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the worthy Gotama's mind<br/>
					can read another's thoughts<br/>
					when he has attained a state of concentration<br/>
					void of thought applied and sustained,<br/>
					so as to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">According to the nature<br/>
					of the thinkings of this worthy,<br/>
					on such and such objects<br/>
					will he immediately direct his thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, surely the worthy Gotama<br/>
					teaches thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reason thus,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind thus,<br/>
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandon this state,<br/>
					acquire that state<br/>
					and abide therein.'" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, brahmin,<br/>
					your words come close<br/>
					and challenge me to a statement!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless I will satisfy you<br/>
					by replying.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do indeed enjoys sorts of more-power in divers ways, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one I become many,<br/>
					from being many I become one:<br/>
					manifest or invisible<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then again, brahmin,<br/>

					<p class="f4">I do so instruct."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, master Gotama,<br/>
					is there any other single monk<br/>
					possessed of these three marvellous powers<br/>
					besides the worthy Gotama?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, indeed, brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">The monks possessed of these three marvellous powers<br/>
					are not just one or two<br/>
					or three, four, or five hundred,<br/>
					but much more than that in number."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, master Gotama,<br/>
					where are those monks now dwelling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this very Order of Monks, brahmin."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br/>

					or points out the way to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or holds up a light in the darkness,<br/>
					that they who have eyes ay see objects, —<br/>

					<p class="f4">I myself, master Gotama,<br/>
					do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama,<br/>

					<p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama<br/>
