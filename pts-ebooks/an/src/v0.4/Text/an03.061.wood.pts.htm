					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three grounds of sectarian tenets,<br/>
					which, though strictly questioned, investigated and discussed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> by wise men,<br/>
					persist in a traditional doctrine<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of inaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[1]</b> There are certain recluses and brahmins who teach thus, who hold this view; —</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever weal or woe or neutral feeling is experienced,<br/>
					all that is due to some previous action.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There are others who teach: -</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[2]</b> Whatsoever weal or woe or neutral feeling is experienced,<br/>
					all that is due to the creation of a Supreme Deity.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[1]</b> Now, monks, as to those recluses and brahmins<br/>

					that whatsoever weal or woe or neutral feeling is experienced,<br/>
					all is due to former action?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned by me they reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, we do.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I say to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So then, owing to a previous action,<br/>
					men will become murderers, thieves, unchaste, liars, slanderers, abusive, babblers, covetous, malicious, and perverse in view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for those who fall back<br/>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now as to the first of these,<br/>
					in what connexion did I speak of six elements?</p>

					<p class="f4">The six elements are these:</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of earth,<br/>
					the element of water,<br/>
					that of heat,<br/>
					that of air,<br/>
					the element of space,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> and<br/>
					the element of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what I meant when I spoke of the six elements.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what connexion did I speak of six spheres of contact?</p>

					<p class="f4">The six spheres of contact are these:</p>

					<p class="f4">The sphere of eye-contact,<br/>
					that of ear-,<br/>
					nose-,<br/>
					tongue-,<br/>
					body-, and<br/>
					the sphere of mind-contact</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what I meant when I spoke of six spheres of contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what connexion did I speak of these eighteen applications of mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing an object with the eye one's thoughts are concerned with the object,<br/>
					whether it give ground for pleasure,<br/>
					pain or neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> an object with the ear one's thoughts are concerned with the object,<br/>

					whether it give ground for pleasure,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Contacting an object with the body one's thoughts are concerned with the object,<br/>
					whether it give ground for pleasure,<br/>
					pain or neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contacting a mental object with the mind one's thoughts are concerned<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> with the object,<br/>
					whether it give ground for pleasure,<br/>
					pain or neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[160]</b></span> That is what I meant when I spoke of the eighteen applications of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as to these four Ariyan truths, in what connexion did I mention them?</p>

					<p class="f4">Based on the six elements, monks, there is descent into the womb.</p>

					<p class="f4">This descent taking place,<br/>
					name-and-shape come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by name-and-shape is the sixfold sphere (of sense).</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by the sixfold sphere is contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by contact is feeling.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now to him who has feeling, monks, I make known:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is i11.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I make known:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of i11.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I make known:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the making i11 to cease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I make known:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the making i11 to cease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth of i11?</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is i11,<br/>
					old age and decay,<br/>
					sickness,<br/>
					death,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					grief,<br/>
					woe,<br/>
					lamentation and despair are i11.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not to get what one desires is i11.</p>

					<p class="f4">In short, the five groups based on grasping are i11.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called "the Ariyan truth of the arising of ill."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth of the making i11 to cease?</p>

					<p class="f4">From the utter fading out and ending of ignorance,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the making i11 to cease?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just this Ariyan Eightfold Way, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view,<br/>

					right action,<br/>
