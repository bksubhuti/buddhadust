					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Monks, the uneducated manyfolk speaks of these three terrors<br/>
					that part mother and son.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">There comes a time<br/>
					when a great fire breaks out.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it breaks out,<br/>
					villages,<br/>
					suburbs<br/>
					and towns are burned.</p>

					<p class="f4">When these are burning,<br/>
					the mother cannot reach her son,<br/>
					and the son cannot reach his mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first terror<br/>
					that the uneducated manyfolk speaks of.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then again, monks,<br/>
					there comes a time<br/>
					when a mighty rain falls.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this happens,<br/>
					a great flood is caused.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the flood comes,<br/>
					villages,<br/>
					suburbs<br/>
					and towns are swept away.</p>

					<p class="f4">When these are being swept away,<br/>
					a mother cannot reach her son,<br/>
					and the son cannot reach his mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second terror<br/>

					and the country-folk mount their carts<br/>
					and drive away.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this happens,<br/>
					amid the scattering of the country-folk in carts,<br/>
					a mother cannot reach her son,<br/>
					and the son cannot reach his mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third terror<br/>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">A mother cannot bear<br/>

					<p class="f4">She says,</p>

					<p class="f4">Let not my son get sick.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let me get sick.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. But, monks, there is a way,<br/>
					there is a practice<br/>
					that leads to the abandoning,<br/>
					to the overpassing<br/>

					that part mother and son,<br/>
					a way which joins mother and son.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is that way,<br/>
					what is that practice<br/>
					which leads to the abandoning,<br/>
					to the overpassing<br/>
					of these three terrors<br/>
					that part mother and son,<br/>
					a way which joins mother and son?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just this Eightfold Way, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right concentration,</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the way,<br/>
					that is the practice<br/>
					which leads to the abandoning,<br/>
					to the overpassing<br/>
					of these three terrors<br/>
					that part mother and son,<br/>
					a way which joins mother and son."</p>
