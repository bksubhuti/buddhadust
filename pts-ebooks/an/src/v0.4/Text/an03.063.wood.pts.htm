					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was journeying about among the Kosalans,<br/>
					attended by a great company of monks,<br/>
					and he came to Venāgapura,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> a brahmin village of the Kosalans.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span> Now the brahmin housefathers of Venāgapura<br/>
					heard the news that Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					son of the Sakyans,<br/>
					who went forth as a Wanderer from the Sakyan clan,<br/>
					was come to Venāgapura.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there went abroad<br/>
					a fair report about Gotama,<br/>
					that Exalted One,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is he,<br/>
					that Arahant<br/>
					who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					Wellfarer,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes known this world<br/>
					together with the world of devas,<br/>
					Maras<br/>
					and Brahmas,<br/>
					together with the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					both of devas and mankind,<br/>
					having himself come to know it thoroughly for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches Dhamma<br/>
					that is lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely in the ending,<br/>
					both in letter and spirit;<br/>
					in all its fulness<br/>
					he preaches the holy life<br/>
					that is utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed for us<br/>
					if we could get the sight<br/>
					of arahants such as these."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then the brahmin housefathers of Venāgapura<br/>
					came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br/>
					some saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some greeted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some raising their joined palms to their foreheads<br/>
					in respect to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some proclaimed their name and clan<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">While others,<br/>
					without saying anything,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					just sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as he thus sat<br/>
					Vacchagotta<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> the brahmin of Venāgapura,<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "It is wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, master Gotama,<br/>
					how serene is the worthy Gotama's air,<br/>
					how clear and translucent<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> his complexion!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as the yellow <span class="f2 g"><b>[164]</b></span> jujube fruit<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> in autumn<br/>
					is clear and translucent,<br/>
					even so is the worthy Gotama's complexion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as a palm-tree fruit<br/>
					just loosed from the stalk<br/>
					is clear and translucent,<br/>
					even so is the worthy Gotama's complexion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a trinket of red gold,<br/>
					wrought in a crucible by a clever goldsmith,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					deftly beaten<br/>
					and laid on a yellow cloth,<br/>
					shines and blazes and glitters,<br/>
					even so the worthy Gotama's senses are calmed,<br/>
					his complexion is clear and translucent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br/>
					as to those couches,<br/>
					both high and broad,<br/>
					such as the sofa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					the divan,<br/>
					together with their coverlets of goat's hair,<br/>
					of divers colours,<br/>
					whiter coverlets,<br/>
					coverlets of wool besprent with flowers,<br/>
					quilts of cotton-wool,<br/>
					embroidered counterpanes<br/>
					and rugs furred on both sides,<br/>
					rugs furred on one side,<br/>
					coverlets gem-studded<br/>
					and of silk,<br/>
					(and other luxurious appointments such as)<br/>

					horse<br/>
					and chariot,<br/>
					rugs of antelope skins,<br/>

					all such seats,<br/>
					both high and low,<br/>
					doubt-less<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> the worthy Gotama can get as he pleases,<br/>
					can get them without toil and trouble."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Brahmin, as to those couches,<br/>
					both high and broad,<br/>
					such as the sofa,<br/>
					the divan,<br/>
					together with their coverlets of goat's hair,<br/>
					of divers colours,<br/>
					whiter coverlets,<br/>

					both high and low,<br/>
					indeed we Wanderers get them hardly,<br/>
					and if gotten<br/>
					they are not to be made use of.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brahmin, there are these three couches,<br/>
					both high and broad,<br/>
					which I can get both here and now<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> as I please,<br/>
					without toil and trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[165]</b></span> They are the high, broad couch celestial,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
					high, broad couch sublime,<br/>
					and the high, broad couch of the Ariyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three couches<br/>
					I get here and now as I please,<br/>
					without toil and trouble."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">5. "Pray, master Gotama,<br/>
					of what sort is that high, broad couch celestial<br/>
					which the worthy Gotama gets here and now as he pleases<br/>
					without toil and trouble?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, brahmin,<br/>
					when I am living dependent<br/>
					on a certain village or suburb,<br/>
					I get myself robed in the forenoon,<br/>
					and taking bowl and outer robe<br/>
					I enter that village or suburb to beg.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I return from my alms-round<br/>
					and have eaten my meal,<br/>
					I make for the edge of a forest.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There I gather together<br/>
					whatever grasses or leaves there are<br/>
					into one place<br/>
					and sit down cross-legged,<br/>
					holding my body straight<br/>
					and setting mindfulness in front of me.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus aloof from sense-desires,<br/>
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br/>
					I enter on the first musing<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					I enter on that inward calm,<br/>
					that single-minded purpose,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second musing,<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br/>
					I become balanced<br/>
					and remain mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experience with the body<br/>
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and I enter on the third musing<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br/>
					I enter and abide in the fourth musing,<br/>
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br/>
					a state of perfect purity<br/>
					of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[166]</b></span> Now, brahmin, when I have reached such a state,<br/>
