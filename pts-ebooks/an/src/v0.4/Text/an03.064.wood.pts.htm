					<p><span class="f2">[185]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[167]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					on the hill Vulture's Peak.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Sarabha<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> so called,<br/>
					the Wanderer,<br/>
					who had not long since deserted this Dhamma-Discipline,<br/>
					was thus speaking in the company<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> at Rājagaha:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span> "I understand the 'Dhamma'<br/>
					of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br/>
					that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then a number of monks,<br/>
					having robed themselves,<br/>
					taking bowl and outer robe,<br/>
					entered Rājagaha to beg.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those monks heard Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>
					so speaking<br/>
					in the company at Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">So when they had done their begging-rounds<br/>
					and had returned and eaten their meal,<br/>
					they went to the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					they said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>
					has not long since deserted this Dhamma-Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">At Rājagaha he is thus speaking in the company:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I understand the "Dhamma"<br/>
					of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br/>
					that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, it would be well<br/>
					if the Exalted One were to go to Snake River bank,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					to the Wanderers' Park<br/>
					where is Sarabha the Wanderer,<br/>
					out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One consented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. So the Exalted One,<br/>
					rising up from his solitary meditation at eventide,<br/>
					went to Snake River bank,<br/>
					to visit Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>
					in the Wanderers' Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On reaching this<br/>
					he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so<br/>
					the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to Sarabha the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, as I hear, Sarabha,<br/>
					that you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I understand the "Dhamma"<br/>
					of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br/>
					that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br/>
					the Exalted One spoke to Sarabha the Wanderer, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Speak, Sarabha!</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that you have understood<br/>
					the 'Dhamma' of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons?</p>

					<p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete<br/>
					I will complete it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is complete<br/>
					I shall receive it gladly."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span> And a second time Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then for the third time<br/>
					the Exalted One spoke to Sarabha the Wanderer, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sarabha, it is by me<br/>
					that the 'Dhamma' of the Sakyans' sons<br/>
					who are recluses<br/>
					has been revealed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Speak, Sarabha!</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that you have understood<br/>
					the 'Dhamma' of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons?</p>

					<p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete<br/>
					I will complete it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is complete<br/>
					I shall receive it gladly."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Thereupon the Wanderers of Rājagaha<br/>
					said this to Sarabha the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, whatever you may have to ask Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					he gives you the opportunity to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Speak, reverend Sarabha!</p>

					<p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete,<br/>
					Gotama the recluse will complete it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is complete,<br/>
					he will receive it gladly."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Sarabha the Wanderer remained silent,<br/>
					confused,<br/>
					hanging his head,<br/>
					looking downwards,<br/>
					a disappointed man,<br/>
					unable to make reply.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">5. So the Exalted One,<br/>
					seeing him in this condition,<br/>
					said to those Wanderers:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wanderers,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> if any one should say to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You have not perfect knowledge of these things,<br/>
					though you claim to be fully enlightened,'</p>

					<p class="f4">I should closely examine him,<br/>
					question him<br/>
					and talk with him.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He, thus closely examined,<br/>
					questioned<br/>
					and talked with,<br/>
					would surely and inevitably<br/>
					be reduced to one of these three conditions: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Either he would shelve the question by another,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					and direct the talk to an alien subject;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would display anger,<br/>
					malignity<br/>
					and sulkiness;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would sit silent,<br/>
					confused,<br/>
					hanging his head,<br/>
					looking downwards,<br/>
					a disappointed man,<br/>
					unable to make reply,<br/>
					just as now does Sarabha the Wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span> Wanderers, if any one were to say to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The "Dhamma" preached by you<br/>
					for the purpose of utterly destroying Ill<br/>
					does not lead those who act accordingly<br/>
					to such a goal,'</p>

					<p class="f4">I should closely examine him,<br/>
					question him<br/>
					and talk with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, thus closely examined,<br/>
					questioned<br/>
					and talked with,<br/>
					would surely and inevitably<br/>
					be reduced to one of these three conditions: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Either he would shelve the question by another,<br/>
					and direct the talk to an alien subject;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would display anger,<br/>
					malignity<br/>
					and sulkiness;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would sit silent,<br/>
					confused,<br/>
					hanging his head,<br/>
					looking downwards,<br/>
					a disappointed man,<br/>
					unable to make reply,<br/>
					just as now does Sarabha the Wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, having thrice<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> uttered his lion's roar<br/>
					in the Wanderers' Park<br/>
					on the bank of Snake River,<br/>
					departed through the air.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">6. Now not long after the departure of the Exalted One<br/>
					those Wanderers assailed Sarabha the Wanderer on all sides<br/>
					with a torrent of abuse,<br/>
					and poking fun at him said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sarabha, even as a decrepit jackal<br/>
					in the great forest,<br/>
					thinking to utter a lion's roar,<br/>
					can only let out just a jackal's scream,<br/>
					so you, friend Sarabha,<br/>
					thinking to utter the lion's roar<br/>
					which none but Gotama the recluse can utter, -<br/>
					you give just such a jackal's scream.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend Sarabha, just as a poor little hen<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
					thinks to crow like a cock,<br/>
					and after all lets out just a poor little hen's cackle,<br/>
					so you, friend Sarabha,<br/>
					thinking to utter the cock-crow<br/>
					that none but Gotama the recluse can utter,<br/>
					let out just a poor little hen's cackle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend Sarabha, just as a young bull-calf,<br/>
					when the cow-pen is empty,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					thinks he bellows deeply (like an old bull),<br/>
					so you, friend Sarabha,<br/>
					think to utter the deep bellow<br/>
					that none but Gotama the recluse can utter."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus did those Wanderers assail Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>
					with a torrent of abuse,<br/>
					poking fun at him.</p>
