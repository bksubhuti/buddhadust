					<p><span class="f2">[188]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One,<br/>
					while going his rounds among the Kosalans<br/>
					with a great <span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span> company of monks, came to Kesaputta,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> a district of the Kosalans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard it said that Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					the Sakyans' son who went forth as a wanderer from the Sakyan clan,<br/>
					had reached Kesaputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this good report was noised abroad about Gotama, that Exalted One, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He it is, the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					Wellfarer,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It were indeed a good thing to get sight of such arahants!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Kālāmas of Kesaputta came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On reaching him, some saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side:<br/>
					some greeted the Exalted One courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side:<br/>
					some raising their joined palms to the Exalted One<br/>
					sat down at one side:<br/>
					some proclaimed their name and clan<br/>
					and did likewise;<br/>
					while others without saying anything<br/>
					just sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as they thus sat<br/>
					the Kālāmas of Kesaputta said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Sir, certain recluses and brahmins come to Kesaputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to their own view,<br/>
					they proclaim and expound it in full:<br/>
					but as to the view of others,<br/>
					they abuse it,<br/>
					revile it,<br/>
					depreciate<br/>
					and cripple it.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, sir, other recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					on coming to Kesaputta,<br/>
					do likewise.</p>

					<p class="f4">When we listen to them, sir,<br/>
					we have doubt and wavering<br/>
					as to which of these worthies is speaking truth<br/>
					and which speaks falsehood."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Yes, Kālāmas, you may well doubt,<br/>
					you may well waver.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a doubtful matter wavering does arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now look you, Kālāmas.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Be ye not misled by report<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					or tradition<br/>
					or hearsay.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not misled by proficiency in the <span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span> collections,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					nor by mere logic or inference,<br/>
					nor after considering reasons,<br/>
					nor after reflection on and approval of some theory,<br/>
					nor because it fits becoming,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					nor out of respect for a recluse (who bolds it).</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Kālāmas, when you know for yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">These things are unprofitable,<br/>
					these things are blameworthy,<br/>
					these things are censured by the intelligent;<br/>
					these things, when performed and undertaken,<br/>
					conduce to loss and sorrow, -</p>

					<p class="f4">then indeed do ye reject them, Kālāmas.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Now what think ye, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">When greed arises within a man,<br/>
					does it arise to his profit or to his loss?</p>

					<p class="f4">'To his loss, sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, Kālāmas, does not this man, thus become greedy,<br/>
					being overcome by greed<br/>
					and losing control of his mind, -<br/>
					does he not kill a living creature,<br/>
					take what is not given,<br/>
					go after another's wife,<br/>

					and lead another into such a state<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">5. "Now what think ye, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">When malice arises within a man,<br/>
					does it arise to his profit or to his loss?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"To his loss, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, Kālāmas, does not this man, thus become malicious,<br/>
					being overcome by malice<br/>
					and losing control of his mind, -<br/>
					does he not kill a living creature,<br/>
					take what is not given,<br/>
					go after another's wife,<br/>
					tell lies<br/>
					and lead another into such a state<br/>
					as causes his loss and sorrow for a long time?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does, indeed, sir."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">6. "Now what think ye, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">When illusion arises within a man,<br/>
					does it arise to his profit or to his loss?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"To his loss, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And does not this man, thus deluded,<br/>
					being overcome by delusion<br/>
					and losing control of his mind, -<br/>
					does he not kill a living creature,<br/>
					take what is not given,<br/>
					go after another's wife,<br/>
					tell lies<br/>
					and lead another into such a state<br/>
					as causes his loss and sorrow for a long time?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[173]</b></span> "He does, sir."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">7. "Well then, Kālāmas, what think ye?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are these things profitable or unprofitable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Unprofitable, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are they blameworthy or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Blameworthy, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are they censured by the intelligent or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They are censured, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If performed and undertaken,<br/>
					do they conduce to loss and sorrow or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They conduce to loss and sorrow, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just so, me-thinks."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">8. "So then, Kālāmas, as to my words to you just now:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Be ye not misled by report or tradition or hearsay.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not misled by proficiency in the collections,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Are these things profitable or unprofitable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They do conduce to happiness, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just so, methinks."</p>

					<p class="f4">14. "So then, Kālāmas, as to my words to you just now:</p>

					<p class="f4">15. Now, Kālāmas, he who is an Ariyan disciple<br/>
