					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three topics of discourse.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">One may talk of past time, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus it was in past time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or one may talk of future time, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus it will be in future time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or one may talk of the present time, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus it is now at present.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it may be understood of a person by his conversation whether he is competent<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> or incompetent to discuss.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, if this person, on being asked a question, does not give a categorical reply to a question requiring it:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					does not give a discriminating reply to a question requiring it:<br/>
					does not reply by a counter-question to, a question requiring it,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span> and does not waive a question which should be waived,<br/>
					— then, monks, such a person is incompetent to discuss.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if this person on being asked these four sorts of questions<br/>
					gives the proper reply,<br/>
					then he is competent to discuss.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, it may be understood of a person by his conversation<br/>
					whether he is competent or incompetent to discuss.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this person on being asked a question<br/>
					does not abide by conclusions,<br/>
					whether right or wrong,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					does not abide by an assumption,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					does not abide by recognized arguments,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					does not abide by usual procedure,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					— in such case, monks,<br/>
					this person is incompetent to discuss.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if he does all these,<br/>
					he is competent to discuss.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, it may be understood of a person by his conversation<br/>
					whether he is competent or incompetent to discuss.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this person, on being asked a question,<br/>
					evades the question by another,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					or turns it off the point,<br/>
					or displays vexation, malice and sulkiness,<br/>
					in such case, monks,<br/>
					he is incompetent to discuss.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if on the other hand he does none of these things,<br/>
					he is competent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again, monks, it may be understood of a person by his conversation<br/>
					whether he is competent or incompetent to discuss.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on being asked a question,<br/>
					he loads with abuse<br/>
					and beats down the questioner,<br/>
					laughs him to scorn<br/>
					and catches him up when he falters,<br/>
					— such an one is incompetent to discuss.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if he does none of these things,<br/>
					he is competent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it may be understood of a person by his conversation<br/>
					whether he is assured<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> or unassured.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who lends not an ear, is unassured.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He who lends an ear is assured.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He, being assured,<br/>
					fully understands one <span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span> thing,<br/>
					comprehends one thing,<br/>
					abandons one thing,<br/>
					realizes one thing.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">So doing he reaches the perfect release.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the profit of talk,<br/>
					this is the profit of deliberation,<br/>
					of assurance,<br/>
					of giving ear to advice,<br/>
					namely, the release of mind without grasping."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">When talk is barred by anger, bias, pride<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
							Men follow a way not Ariyan and seek<br/>
							For one another's faults, rejoice to hear<br/>
							A word ill spoken, a slip o' the tongue, — delight<br/>
							Each in the other's oonfusion and defeat.<br/>
							That way of talk the Ariyan follows not.<br/>
							If fain to speak, the wise man, since he knows<br/>
							The time, the way of speech the Ariyans use,<br/>
							The practice proper for expounding Dhamma,<br/>
							That sage will use such talk: not barred by wrath,<br/>
							Unbiased, with unruffled mind; not spiteful,<br/>
							Not arbitrary-minded, not detracting;<br/>
							But with full knowledge speaking he speaks well,<br/>
							Pleased with right speech, not gleeful at a slip.<br/>
							Not studying censure, catching not at faults:<br/>
							Reviles not, crushes not, nor speaks at random.<br/>
							O! I good men's words alike instruct and please:<br/>
							Thus Ariyans talk. Such is the Ariyan speech.<br/>
							And knowing this the wise will humbly speak.'</p>
