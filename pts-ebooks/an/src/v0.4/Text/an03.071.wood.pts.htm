					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāvatthī was the occasion (for this conversation).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now one Channa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> a Wanderer,<br/>
					came to see the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously<br/>
					and, after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					Channa the Wanderer said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend Ānanda, do you (people) preach<br/>
					the abandoning of passion,<br/>
					of malice<br/>
					and delusion?"</p>

					<p class="f4"> <span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span> "We do indeed, reverend sir."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing what disadvantage therein<br/>
					do you preach<br/>
					the abandoning of passion,<br/>
					of malice<br/>
					and delusion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Why, sir, one who is overwhelmed by passion,<br/>
					losing control of mind,<br/>
					plans things which trouble himself,<br/>
					which trouble others,<br/>
					which trouble both himself and others,<br/>
					and so experiences<br/>
					mental suffering and dejection.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if passion be abandoned<br/>
					he does not lose control of mind,<br/>
					plan things which trouble himself,<br/>
					which trouble others,<br/>
					which trouble both himself and others,<br/>
					and so does not experience<br/>
					mental suffering and dejection.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, sir, one who is overwhelmed by passion<br/>
					practises immorality<br/>
					practises immorality in deed,<br/>
					practises immorality word<br/>
					practises immorality thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if passion be abandoned<br/>
					he does not practises immorality in deed,<br/>
					he does not practises immorality in word<br/>
					he does not practises immorality in thought.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, sir, one who is overwhelmed by passion<br/>
					understands not, as it really is, his own profit,<br/>
					understands not, as it really is, the profit of others,<br/>
					understands not, as it really is, the profit of self and others.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if passion be abandoned<br/>

					he understands, as it really is, the profit of others,<br/>
					he understands, as it really is, the profit of self and others.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, sir, passion is the cause of blindness,<br/>
					of not seeing,<br/>
					of not knowing,<br/>
					of loss of insight:<br/>
					it is joined with vexation,<br/>
					it does not conduce to Nibbāna.</p>
