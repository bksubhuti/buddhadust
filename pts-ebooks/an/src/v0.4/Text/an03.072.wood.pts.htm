					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying at Kosambī, in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain housefather, <span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span> who was a follower of an ascetic mendicant,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came to see tbe venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br/>
					he greeted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					he said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					whose doctrine is well taught?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who are rightly conducted in the world?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who are well-farers in the world?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, housefather, in this matter<br/>
					I will put you a question.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you answer my question<br/>
					as you think fit.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, housefather?</p>

					<p class="f4">They who preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of passion,<br/>
					they who preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of malice<br/>
					they who preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of delusion, —<br/>
					is their doctrine well preached or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">How think you of this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The doctrine of they who preach<br/>
					the abandoning of passion,<br/>
					the doctrine of they who preach<br/>
					the abandoning of malice<br/>
					the doctrine of they who preach<br/>
					the abandoning of delusion, sir,<br/>
					is well preached.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is my opinion."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Now what think you, housefather?</p>

					<p class="f4">They who so conduct themselves<br/>
					as to abandon passion,<br/>
					they who so conduct themselves<br/>
					as to abandon malice<br/>
					they who so conduct themselves<br/>
					as to abandon delusion, —<br/>
					are they well conducted in the world?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is your opinion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They who so conduct themselves<br/>
					as to abandon passion,<br/>
					they who so conduct themselves<br/>
					as to abandon malice<br/>
					they who so conduct themselves<br/>
					as to abandon delusion, sir,<br/>
					certainly they are well conducted in the world."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Now what think you, housefather?</p>

					<p class="f4">They whose passion is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br/>
					they whose whose malice is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br/>
					they whose whose delusion is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time, —<br/>
					are such well-farers in the world or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is your opinion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They whose passion is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br/>
					they whose whose malice is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br/>
					they whose whose delusion is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time, such, sir,<br/>
					are well-farers in the world, methinks."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. 'Then you have admitted this much:</p>

					<p class="f4">They who preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of passion,<br/>
					they who preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of malice<br/>
					they who preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of delusion, —<br/>
					their doctrine is well preached.</p>

					<p class="f4">They who so conduct themselves<br/>
					as to abandon passion,<br/>
					they who so conduct themselves<br/>
					as to abandon malice<br/>
					they who so conduct themselves<br/>
					as to abandon delusion, —<br/>
					are well conducted in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">They whose passion is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br/>
					they whose whose malice is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br/>
					they whose whose delusion is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time, —<br/>
					are well-farers in the world."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous!</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is no trumpeting of one's own creed,<br/>
					no depreciation of another's <span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span> creed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					but just teaching of Dhamma<br/>
					in its proper sphere.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">You have spoken of (man's) welfare,<br/>
					and self is not brought in question.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Now you yourself, worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of passion,<br/>
					preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of malice<br/>
					preach a doctrine<br/>
					for the abandoning of delusion<br/>
					and your doctrine is well preached.</p>

					<p class="f4">You conduct yourself<br/>
					so as to abandon passion,<br/>
					you conduct yourself<br/>
					so as to abandon malice<br/>
					you conduct yourself<br/>
					so as to abandon delusion, —<br/>
					and you are well conducted in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">In you, worthy Ānanda, passion is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br/>
					malice is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br/>
					delusion is abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made such as not to become,<br/>
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time,<br/>
					surely you are a well-farer in the world.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Excellent, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if one should raise the fallen,<br/>
					open up what is hidden,<br/>
					point out the way<br/>
					to one gone astray,<br/>
					hold up a shining light<br/>
					so that they who have eyes<br/>
					may see forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus has Dhamma been expounded<br/>
					by the worthy Ānanda<br/>
					in divers ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, worthy Ānanda,<br/>
					do go for refuge to the Buddha,<br/>
					to Dhamma,<br/>
					to the Order of Monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let master Ānanda accept me<br/>
					as a lay-follower<br/>
					from this day forth<br/>
					so long as life shall last<br/>
					as one who has so taken refuge."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Attho ca vutto attā ca anupanīto.</i> <i>Comy.</i> takes this to mean, 'You have given an answer to my question, but you do not say "I myself have such virtues."' The same phrase occurs at <i>A.</i> iii, 359 (where <i>Comy.</i> says nothing). There is, I think, no reference here to the soul-theory.</p>
