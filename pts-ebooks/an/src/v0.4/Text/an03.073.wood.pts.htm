					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br/>
					near Kapilavatthu, in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>
					the Exalted One was just recovered from sickness,<br/>
					not long recovered from sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahānāma the Sakyan<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br/>
					he saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[199]</b></span> "For a long time, lord,<br/>
					I have known Dhamma which teaches thus: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Knowledge belongs to the man of composed mind,<br/>
					not to the restless-minded.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, does concentration come first,<br/>
					then knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or does knowledge come first,<br/>
					then concentration?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here is the Exalted One<br/>
					just recovered from sickness,<br/>
					quite lately recovered,<br/>
					and here is this Mahānāma the Sakyan<br/>
					asking him questions on a profound subject.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I take him aside<br/>
					and acquaint him with Dhamma.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					took Mahānāma the Sakyan by the arm,<br/>
					led him aside<br/>
					and said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Mahānāma, a learner's morality has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					likewise an adept's morality.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way a learner's concentration<br/>
					and that of an adept<br/>
					have been spoken of by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also the insight of a learner<br/>
					and that of an adept<br/>
					have been spoken of by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Now what is<br/>
					the learner's morality?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Mahānāma, a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligations;<br/>
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct<br/>
					he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br/>
					he takes up and trains himself<br/>
					in the rules of morality.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the learner's morality.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And what, Mahānāma, is<br/>
					the learner's concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein. Mahānāma, a monk,<br/>
					aloof from sense-desires,<br/>
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br/>
					enters on the first musing<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					he enters on that inward calm,<br/>
					that single-minded purpose,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second musing,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br/>
					he becomes balanced<br/>
					and remains mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences with the body<br/>
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he enters on the third musing<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br/>
					a state of perfect purity<br/>
					of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the learner's concentration.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">6. And what, Mahānāma, is<br/>
					the learner's insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Mahānāma, a monk understands,<br/>
					as it really is,</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the making of Ill to cease'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice<br/>
					that leads to the ending of III'.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the learner's insight.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Mahānāma,<br/>
					that Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					thus equipped with morality,<br/>
					concentration<br/>
					and insight,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					by the destruction of the āsavas<br/>
					himself having come to know<br/>
					thoroughly in this very <span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span> life<br/>
					the heart's release<br/>
					and the release by insight<br/>
					which is free from the āsavas,<br/>
					having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">(This is the state of the adept.)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Mahānāma,<br/>
					a learner's morality<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					an adept's morality<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					a learner's concentration<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					an adept's concentration<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					a learner's insight<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					an adept's insight<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One."</p>
