					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī,<br/>
					in Great Grove,<br/>
					at the House with the Peaked Gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Abhaya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> and Paṇḍitakumāraka, the Licchavīs,<br/>
					came to visit the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br/>
					they saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus sat,<br/>
					Abhaya the Licchavī said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, Nātha's son, the Unclothed,<br/>
					claims to be all-knowing,<br/>
					all-seeing,<br/>
					and to have all-comprising<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">He says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whether I walk<br/>
					or stand<br/>
					or sleep<br/>
					or wake,<br/>
					my knowledge and vision<br/>
					are always and without a break<br/>
					present before me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He proclaims the making an end of former deeds<br/>
					by ascetic practice,<br/>
					and the breaking down of<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> the power of fresh deeds<br/>
					by inaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus by the destruction of deeds<br/>
					will result the destruction of Ill:<br/>
					by the destruction of Ill,<br/>
					the destruction of feeling:<br/>
					by the destruction of feeling<br/>
					all Ill will be exhausted.</p>

					<p class="f4">So by this visible process<br/>
					one passes beyond (the round of existence).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What, sir, does the Exalted One say about this?"</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[201]</b></span> 2. "Abhaya, these three ways<br/>
					of cleansing by wearing out<br/>
					are well proclaimed by that Exalted One<br/>
					who knows,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> who sees,<br/>
					that Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					for the cleansing of beings,<br/>
					for their crossing beyond sorrow and lamentation,<br/>
					for the destruction of grief and woe,<br/>
					for the winning of the Method,<br/>
					for the realizing of Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Abhaya, a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligations;<br/>
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct<br/>
					he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br/>
					he takes up and trains himself<br/>
					in the rules of morality.</p>

						

					<p class="f4">He performs no fresh action,<br/>
					he makes an end of former action<br/>
					which has affected him.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the (first way of) cleansing<br/>
					by wearing out,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					a visible process,<br/>
					not a matter of time,<br/>
					but one that invites to come and see,<br/>
					that leads onwards (to the Goal),<br/>
					to be understood by the intelligent<br/>
					each for himself.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Abhaya, that monk, thus possessed of morality, aloof from sensual desires,<br/>
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br/>
					enters on the first musing<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					he enters on that inward calm,<br/>
					that single-minded purpose,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second musing,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br/>
					he becomes balanced<br/>
					and remains mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences with the body<br/>
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he enters on the third musing<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br/>
					a state of perfect purity<br/>
					of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">He performs no fresh action,<br/>
					he makes an end of former action<br/>
					which has affected him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the (second way of) cleansing<br/>
					by wearing out,<br/>
					a visible process,<br/>
					not a matter of time,<br/>
					but one that invites to come and see,<br/>
					that leads onwards (to the Goal),<br/>
					to be understood by the intelligent<br/>
					each for himself.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Abhaya, that monk, thus possessed morality,<br/>
					concentration<br/>
					and insight,<br/>
					by the destruction of the āsavas<br/>
					himself having come to know<br/>
					thoroughly in this very life<br/>
					the heart's release<br/>
					and the release by insight<br/>
					which is free from the āsavas,<br/>
					having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He performs no fresh action,<br/>
					he makes an end of former action<br/>
					which has affected him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the (third way of) cleansing<br/>
					by wearing out,<br/>
					a visible process,<br/>
					not a matter of time,<br/>
					but one that invites to come and see,<br/>
					that leads onwards (to the Goal),<br/>
					to be understood by the intelligent<br/>
					each for himself.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Abhaya, are the three ways<br/>
					of cleansing by wearing out,<br/>
					well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					who knows, who sees,<br/>
					that Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					for the cleansing of beings,<br/>
					for their crossing beyond sorrow and lamentation,<br/>
					for the destruction of grief and woe,<br/>
					for the winning of the Method,<br/>
					for the realizing of Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. At these words Paṇḍitakumāraka the Licchavī said this to Abhaya the Licchavī:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Abhaya, my good fellow!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Do you approve of the venerable Ānanda's good words<br/>
