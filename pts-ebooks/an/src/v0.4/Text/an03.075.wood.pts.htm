					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī,<br/>
					in Great Grove,<br/>
					at the House with the Peaked Gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat thus<br/>
					the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, one for whom you have fellow-feeling<br/>
					and those who think you should be listened to,<br/>
					whether friends<br/>
					or intimates<br/>
					or kinsmen<br/>
					or blood relations, -<br/>
					such ought to be advised about,<br/>
					grounded on,<br/>
					established in three particulars.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">2. They should be advised about,<br/>
					grounded on,<br/>
					established in<br/>
					unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is,<br/>
					the Exalted One,<br/>
					the Arahant,<br/>
					who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Wellfarer,<br/>
					World-Knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer of beings to be tamed,<br/>
					Teacher of Devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha is the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They should be advised about,<br/>
					grounded on,<br/>

					unwavering loyalty to Dhamma, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a real thing, not a matter of time.</p>

					<p class="f4">It invites one to come and see it.</p>

					<p class="f4">It leads one onwards.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is to be understood by the intelligent for themselves.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">They should be advised about,<br/>
					grounded on,<br/>
					established in<br/>
					unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well conducted<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>
					walking uprightly<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>
					walking in the right way<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>
					to wit, the four pairs of human beings,<br/>
					the eight sorts of human beings:<br/>
					that Order of disciples of the Exalted One<br/>
					is worthy of respect,<br/>
					offerings and gifts,<br/>
