					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī,<br/>
					in Great Grove,<br/>
					at the House with the Peaked Gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat thus<br/>
					the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What think you, Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">Will every sort of moral practice,<br/>
					way of living,<br/>
					sanctity of life<br/>
					and excellence of service<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					have a like fruit hereafter?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would not say, lord,<br/>
					that it is inevitably so."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, then, do you go into particulars."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"For instance, lord,<br/>
					that moral practice,<br/>
					way of living,<br/>
					sanctity of life<br/>
					and excellence of service<br/>
					which increase unprofitable states<br/>
					and decrease profitable states<br/>
					in him who observes <span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span> them, -<br/>
					such moral practice,<br/>
					way of living,<br/>
					sanctity of life<br/>
					and excellence of service<br/>
					are without fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">But,<br/>
					that moral practice,<br/>
					way of living,<br/>
					sanctity of life<br/>
					and excellence of service<br/>
					which increase profitable states<br/>
					and decrease unprofitable states<br/>
					in him who observes them, -<br/>
					such moral practice,<br/>
					way of living,<br/>
					sanctity of life<br/>
					and excellence of service<br/>
					do have this fruit."</p>

					<p class="f4">So said the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					and the Teacher agreed with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Teacher agrees with me",<br/>
					rose up from his seat,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/>
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the venerable Ānanda was gone<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, Ānanda is a learner.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet it would not be easy<br/>
					to find his equal in insight."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>
