					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī,<br/>
					in Great Grove,<br/>
					at the House with the Peaked Gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, there are these three sorts of scents<br/>
					whose savour spreads along with the wind,<br/>
					but not against the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Root-scent,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					heart-wood scent<br/>
					and the scent of flowers.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three sorts of scents<br/>
					whose savour spreads along with the wind,<br/>
					but not against the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any sort of scent<br/>
					whose savour spreads with the wind,<br/>
					against the wind<br/>
					and both ways alike?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is such a scent, Ānanda."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is that scent, lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "In this connexion, Ānanda,<br/>
					in whatsoever village or district<br/>
					there is a woman or a man<br/>
					who has taken refuge in the Buddha,<br/>
					Dhamma<br/>
					and the Order,<br/>
					who abstains from slaying,<br/>
					stealing,<br/>
					wrong practice in sensual lust,<br/>
					from falsehood,<br/>
					from addiction to intoxicants<br/>
					that cause sloth:<br/>
					who is virtuous,<br/>
					of a lovely nature,<br/>
					who dwells at home<br/>
					with heart free from the taint of stinginess,<br/>
					who is open-handed,<br/>
					pure-handed,<br/>
					delighting in giving up,<br/>
					one to ask a favour of,<br/>
					one who delights in sharing gifts with others, -<br/>
					of such an one<br/>
					recluses and hermits sing the praises<br/>
					in all quarters, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In such and such a village or district<br/>

					<p class="f4">Moreover the Devas and non-humans<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					sing his praises in <span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span> thus:</p>
