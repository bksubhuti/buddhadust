					<p> <span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span> </p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					salauted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side he said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the presence of the Exalted One, lord,<br/>
					in his very presence<br/>
					I have received this saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ānanda, Abhibhu, the disciple of the Buddha Sikhin,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					standing in the Brahma world,<br/>
					could make its thousand realms hear his voice.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, how far can the Arahant,<br/>
					the Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					make his voice heard?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He was just a disciple,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Immeasurable are the Tathāgatas."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time the venerable Ānanda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the presence of the Exalted One, lord,<br/>
					in his very presence<br/>
					I have received this saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ānanda, Abhibhu, the disciple of the Buddha Sikhin,<br/>
					standing in the Brahma world,<br/>
					could make its thousand realms hear his voice.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far can the Arahant,<br/>
					the Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					make his voice heard?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the Exalted one said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He was just a disciple,Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Immeasurable are the Tathāgatas."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time the venerable Ānanda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the presence of the Exalted One, lord,<br/>
					in his very presence<br/>
					I have received this saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ānanda, Abhibhu, the disciple of the Buddha Sikhin,<br/>
					standing in the Brahma world,<br/>
					could make its thousand realms hear his voice.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far can the Arahant,<br/>
					the Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					make his voice heard?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then answered the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Have you ever heard, Ānanda,<br/>
					of the system of the thousand lesser<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> worlds?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time for this, O Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the time for this, O Well-farer, -<br/>
					for the Exalted One to speak!</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing the Exalted One<br/>
					the monks will bear it in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span> "Then, Ānanda,<br/>
					do you listen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Attend closely<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, lord," replied the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					to the Exalted One,<br/>
					who said:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "As far as moon and sun move in their course<br/>
					and light up all quarters with their radiance,<br/>
					so far extends the thousandfold world-system.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein are a thousand moons,<br/>
					a thousand suns,<br/>
					a thousand Sinerus, lords of mountains:<br/>
					a thousand Rose-Apple Lands,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					a thousand Western Ox-wainsa<br/>
					thousand Northern Kurus,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					a thousand Eastern Videhas;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					four thousand mighty Oceans,<br/>
					four thousand Mighty Ruler<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span>,<br/>
					a thousand Four Great Rulers,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					a thousand heavens of the Thirty-Three,<br/>
					a thousand Yama worlds,<br/>
					a thousand heavens of the Devas of Delight,<br/>
					a thousand heavens of the Devas that delight in creation,<br/>
					the same of those Devas that delight in others' creations,<br/>
					and a thousand Brahma worlds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda,<br/>
					is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The system of the thousand lesser worlds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A system a thousandfold the size of this<br/>
					is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Twice-a-thousand Middling Thousandfold World-system.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A system a thousandfold the size of this is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Thrice-a-thousand Mighty Thousandfold World-system.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, if he wished it,<br/>
					the Tathāgata could make his voice heard<br/>
					throughout this last-named world-system,<br/>
					or<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> even further,<br/>
					if he chose."</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Pray, lord, how could that be done?</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this connexion, Ānanda,<br/>
					the Tathāgata suffuses with <span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span> radiance the Thrice-a-thousand Mighty Thousandfold World-system.</p>

					<p class="f4">When its inhabitants perceive this,<br/>
					then the Tathāgata would give utterance<br/>
					and make the sound heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he would do it."</p>

					<p class="f4">5. At these words the venerable Ānanda exclaimed to the venerable Udāyin:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"It is indeed a gain for me!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well gotten indeed by me it is<br/>
					that my teacher is of such mighty power and majesty!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereupon the venerable Udayin said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is it to you, friend Ānanda,<br/>
					that your teacher should be of such mighty power and majesty?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Exalted One said to the venerable Udayin:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say not so, Udayin!</p>

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Udayin!</p>

					<p class="f4">If Ānanda were to make an end<br/>
					without attaining perfect freedom from passion,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					yet by virtue of his heart of faith<br/>
					he would seven times win rule among the Devas,<br/>
					seven times would he win rule in this Rose-Apple Land.</p>

					<p class="f4">Howbeit, Udayin, in this very life<br/>
					Ānanda shall attain to final passing away."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The second of the seven traditional Buddhas.

Sikhin had a pair of disciples, chief, elect, named Abhibhu and Sambhava ... (and Abhibhu said) 'I profess, lord, that using just such speech as if I were speaking in the midst of our Order, I am able, as I stand in the Brahma world, to make its thousand realms hear my voice.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>Pubba-videhā,</i> the eastern. These make up a <i>cakkavāla</i> with Mt. Meru in the midst, a flat-world-system.

					<hr class="demi"/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> No Nidana is given. In the first sutta previously where the location is given it is for Ānanda, who is then residing in Vesālī, in the Great Grove, at the House with the Peaked Gable. The following suttas all begin with "There then ... ," So it is probably that Gotama was residing there or nearby. Sutta 73, however has him residing among the Saakyans near Kapilavatthu, in Banyan Park. </p>
