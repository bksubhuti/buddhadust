					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three preliminaries<br/>
					are to be carried out by a yeoman farmer.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the yeoman farmer must first of all<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> well plough and harrow his field,<br/>
					and when these things are done<br/>
					he must sow his seed at the proper season.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done this<br/>
					he lets in the water<br/>
					and lets it out again<br/>
					in proper season.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three preliminaries.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. In the same way, monks,<br/>
					these three preliminaries<br/>
					are to be carried out by a monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The undertaking of the training<br/>
					in the higher morality,<br/>
					the undertaking of the training<br/>
					in the higher thought<br/>
					the undertaking of the training<br/>
					in the higher insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Keen shall be our desire<br/>
					to undertake the training<br/>
					in the higher morality:<br/>
					keen shall be our desire<br/>
					to undertake the training<br/>
					in the higher thought,<br/>
					keen shall be our desire<br/>
					to undertake the training<br/>
					in the higher insight.'</p>
