					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, this recital to be made twice a month<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span> amounts to more than one hundred and fifty rules<br/>
					wherein are trained<br/>
					clansmen who are eager for their welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now all these combine together<br/>
					to make these three forms of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The higher morality,<br/>
					the higher thought<br/>
					and the higher insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein are combined<br/>
					one and all of these rules.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now, Monks, in this matter<br/>
					a monk keeps the laws of morality in full,<br/>
					he is moderately given to mental concentration,<br/>
					moderately given to striving for insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever minor, trifling observances<br/>
					he may transgress,<br/>
					he is cleared of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not declare him<br/>
					to be rendered unfit because of them,<br/>
					for he strictly observes<br/>
					the rudiments of the holy life,<br/>
					the constituents of the holy life:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is established in morality,<br/>
					he trains himself in the rules of training<br/>
					by undertaking them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one,<br/>
					by destroying three fetters<br/>
					is a stream-winner,<br/>
					is destined to seven more births at most:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					seven times more at most<br/>
					he fares and wanders up and down<br/>
					among devas and mankind<br/>
					and then makes an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, such an one again,<br/>
					by destroying three fetters,<br/>
					is reborn in a good family.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He fares and wanders up and down<br/>
					in two or three families<br/>
					and then makes an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, such an one again,<br/>
					by destroying three fetters,<br/>
					is a "one-seeder":<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					he just takes one rebirth as a man<br/>
					and then makes an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This monk, by destroying three fetters<br/>
					and weakening those of lust,<br/>
					malice<br/>
					and delusion,<br/>
					is a once-returner.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes back to this world<br/>
					only once and makes an end of Ill.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Again, Monks, in this matter<br/>
					a monk keeps the laws of morality in full,<br/>
					he practises concentration in full,<br/>
					but he is moderately given to striving for insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever minor, trifling observances<br/>
					he may transgress,<br/>
					he is cleared of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not declare him<br/>
					to be rendered unfit because of them,<br/>
					for he strictly observes<br/>
					the rudiments of the holy life,<br/>
					the constituents of the holy life:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is established in morality,<br/>
					he trains himself in the rules of training<br/>
					by undertaking them.</p>

					<p class="f4">By destroying the five fetters<br/>
					binding to rebirth (in the lower worlds)<br/>
					he is "one who goes upstream,"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					he goes to the Pure Abodes.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, by destroying these five fetters,<br/>
					he attains release without much trouble.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, by destroying these five fetters,<br/>
					he attains release with some little trouble.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, by destroying these five fetters,<br/>
					he attains release by reduction of his time.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, by destroying these five fetters,<br/>
					he attains release midway.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Again, monks, a monk keeps the laws of morality in full,<br/>
					he practises concentration in full,<br/>
					he practises the acquiring of insight in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever minor, trifling observances<br/>
					he may transgress,<br/>
					he is cleared of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not declare him<br/>
					to be rendered unfit because of them,<br/>
					for he strictly observes<br/>
					the rudiments of the holy life,<br/>
					the constituents of the holy life:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is established in morality,<br/>
					he trains himself in the rules of training<br/>
					by undertaking them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, by destroying the āsavas,<br/>
					in this very life<br/>
					himself knowing it thoroughly<br/>
					realizes the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					and attaining it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span> Thus, monks, the partial fulfiller (of observances)<br/>
					attains partially:<br/>
					the perfect observer<br/>
					attains in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not barren of result<br/>
					are these rules of the training,<br/>
					I declare."</p>
