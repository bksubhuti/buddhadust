					<hr/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, this recital to be made twice a month<br/>
					amounts to more than one hundred and fifty rules<br/>
					wherein are trained<br/>
					clansmen who are eager for their welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now all these combine together<br/>
					to make these three forms of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The higher morality,<br/>
					the higher thought<br/>
					and the higher insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein are combined<br/>
					one and all of these rules.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now, Monks, in this matter<br/>
					a monk keeps the laws of morality in full,<br/>
					he practises concentration in full,<br/>
					he practises the acquiring of insight in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever minor, trifling observances<br/>
					he may transgress,<br/>
					he is cleared of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not declare him<br/>
					to be rendered unfit because of them,<br/>
					for he strictly observes<br/>
					the rudiments of the holy life,<br/>
					the constituents of the holy life:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is established in morality,<br/>
					he trains himself in the rules of training<br/>
					by undertaking them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, by destroying the āsavas,<br/>
					in this very life himself comes to know<br/>
					thoroughly the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					and attaining it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Yet if he attain not,<br/>
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					by destroying the five fetters<br/>
					that bind (to the lower worlds)<br/>
					he attains release midway.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If he attain not,<br/>
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br/>
					by destroying the five fetters<br/>
					that bind (to the lower worlds)<br/>
					he wins release by reduction of his time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If he attain not,<br/>
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br/>
					by destroying the five fetters<br/>
					that bind (to the lower worlds)<br/>
					he wins release without much trouble.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If he attain not,<br/>
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br/>
					by destroying the five fetters<br/>
					that bind (to the lower worlds)<br/>
					he wins release with some little trouble.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If he attain not,<br/>
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br/>
					by destroying the five fetters<br/>
					that bind (to the lower worlds)<br/>
					he wins release he is one who goes upstream<br/>
					who goes to the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, if he attain not that,<br/>
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br/>
					yet by destroying three fetters<br/>
					and weakening those of lust,<br/>
					malice<br/>
					and delusion,<br/>
					he is a once-returner:<br/>
					once more coming back to this world<br/>
					he makes an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, if he attain not,<br/>
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br/>
					by destroying three fetters<br/>
					he is a "one-seeder":<br/>
					he takes just one birth as a man<br/>
					and then makes an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, if he attain not,<br/>
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br/>
					yet by destroying three fetters<br/>
					he is reborn in a good family:<br/>
					he fares and wanders up and down<br/>
					in two or three families<br/>
					and makes an end of III.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, if he attain not,<br/>
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br/>
					by the destruction of three fetters<br/>
					he is destined to seven more births at most:<br/>
					he fares and wanders up and down<br/>
					among devas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> and mankind<br/>
					seven times at most<br/>
					and then makes an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, he who observes in full<br/>
					attains in full:<br/>
					he who observes partially<br/>
					attains partially.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not barren of result<br/>
					are the rules of the training,<br/>
					I declare."</p>
