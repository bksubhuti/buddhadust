					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three forms of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span> The training in the higher morality,<br/>
					that in the higher thought<br/>
					and that in the higher insight.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher morality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk lives virtuous,<br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligations;<br/>
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct<br/>
					he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br/>
					he takes up and trains himself<br/>
					in the rules of morality.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the training in the higher morality.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, remote from sensual desires,<br/>
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br/>
					enters on the first musing<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					he enters on that inward calm,<br/>
					that single-minded purpose,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second musing,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br/>
					he becomes balanced<br/>
					and remains mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences with the body<br/>
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he enters on the third musing<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br/>
					a state of perfect purity<br/>
					of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the training in the higher thought.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk understands, as it really is, the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice leading to the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the training in the higher insight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three forms of training."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="demi"/>

						

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Here 'higher consciousness' would be a more appropriate rendering for adhi-citta, since 'thought' has ceased in this trance.</p>
