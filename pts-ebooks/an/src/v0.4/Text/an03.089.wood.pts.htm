					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three forms of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The training in the higher morality,<br/>
					that in the higher thought<br/>
					and that in the higher insight.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher morality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk lives virtuous,<br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligations;<br/>
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct<br/>
					he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br/>
					he takes up and trains himself<br/>
					in the rules of morality.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the training in the higher morality.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, remote from sensual desires,<br/>
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br/>
					enters on the first musing<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					he enters on that inward calm,<br/>
					that single-minded purpose,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second musing,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br/>
					he becomes balanced<br/>
					and remains mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences with the body<br/>
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he enters on the third musing<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br/>
					a state of perfect purity<br/>
					of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the training in the higher thought.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, by destroying the āsavas,<br/>
					himself in this very life<br/>
					comes to know thoroughly<br/>
					the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight<br/>
					which is without the āsavas,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					"the training in the higher insight."</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three forms of training.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whoso hath zeal, courage and energy,<br/>
							Is apt to meditate, alert of mind,<br/>
							Guarding the forces of his body well<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
							Let him pursue the threefold higher walk,<br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span> Loftiest code of conduct, mind, insight,<br/>

							Mastered with infinite concentration<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> rapt,<br/>
							This do they call the training and the course<br/>

							Brave hero<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> faring to the Way's High End.<br/>
							To him when consciousness doth near its end,<br/>
