					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was going his rounds among the Kosalans<br/>
					together with a great company of monks,<br/>
					and on coming to Pankadhā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					a district of the Kosalans,<br/>
					there abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Now Pankadhā is a district of the Kosalans.)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					a certain monk named Kassapa,<br/>
					of the Kassapa clan,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					was resident at Pankadhā,<br/>
					and it happened that the Exalted One was instructing,<br/>
					inciting<br/>
					and gladdening the monks<br/>
					with a religious talk<br/>
					suitable to the keeping of the <span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span> precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk Kassapa,<br/>
					while the Exalted One was tbus engaged,<br/>
					did not approve,<br/>
					was dissatisfied (and kept thinking):</p>

					<p class="f4">"This recluse is much too scrupulous."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">2. So the Exalted One,<br/>
					after staying at Pankadhā as long as he wished,<br/>
					set forth on his rounds towards Rājagaha,<br/>
					and on arrival<br/>
					took up his quarters there<br/>
					and was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					on Vultures' Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk Kassapa<br/>
					of the Kassapa clan,<br/>
					not long after the departure of the Exalted One,<br/>
					felt remorse and regret,<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a loss to me!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is indeed no gain to me!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is ill-gotten by me!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is indeed a thing<br/>
					not well gotten by me that,<br/>
					when the Exalted One was instructing,<br/>
					inciting<br/>
					and gladdening the monks<br/>
					with a religious talk<br/>
					suitable to the keeping of the precepts,<br/>
					I did not approve<br/>
					but was dissatisfied,<br/>
					and thought:<br/>
					'This recluse is much too scrupulous'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now I were to go to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					were to explain my transgression to him as such."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. So the monk Kassapa<br/>
					of the Kassapa clan<br/>
					set his lodging in order,<br/>
					took bowl and outer robe<br/>
					and set off for Rājagaha<br/>
					and thence to where the Exalted One was staying<br/>
					on Vultures' Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br/>
					he saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					Kassapa the monk said this<br/>
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord,<br/>
					the Exalted One was going his rounds among the Kosalans<br/>
					together with a great company of monks,<br/>
					and on coming to Pankadhā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					a district of the Kosalans,<br/>
					there abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					I was resident at Pankadhā,<br/>
					and it happened that the Exalted One was instructing,<br/>
					inciting<br/>
					and gladdening the monks<br/>
					with a religious talk<br/>
					suitable to the keeping of the precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I,<br/>
					while the Exalted One was instructing,<br/>
					inciting<br/>
					and gladdening the monks<br/>
					with a religious talk<br/>
					suitable to the keeping of the precepts,<br/>
					did not approve,<br/>
					was dissatisfied (and kept thinking):</p>

					<p class="f4">'This recluse is much too scrupulous.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/>
					after staying at Pankadhā as long as he wished,<br/>
					set forth on his rounds<br/>
					towards Rājagaha,<br/>
					and on arrival took up his quarters there<br/>
					and was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					on Vultures' Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I,<br/>
					not long after the departure of the Exalted One,<br/>
					felt remorse and regret,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'It is a loss to me!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is indeed no gain to me!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is ill-gotten by me!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is indeed a thing<br/>
					not well gotten by me that,<br/>
					when the Exalted One was instructing,<br/>
					inciting<br/>
					and gladdening the monks<br/>
					with a religious talk<br/>
					suitable to the keeping of the precepts,<br/>
					I did not approve<br/>
					but was dissatisfied,<br/>
					and thought:<br/>
					"This recluse is much too scrupulous".</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now I were to go to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					were to explain my transgression to him as such.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span> Transgression, lord, overcame me,<br/>
					such was my folly,<br/>
					my infatuation,<br/>
					my wrong-doing,<br/>
					in that,<br/>
					while the Exalted One was instructing,<br/>
					inciting<br/>
					and gladdening the monks<br/>
					with a religious talk<br/>
					suitable to the keeping of the precepts,<br/>
					I did not approve<br/>
					but was dissatisfied,<br/>
					and thought:<br/>
					'This recluse is much too scrupulous'.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One, lord,<br/>
					accept my confession from me<br/>
					who have transgressed,<br/>
					to be a restraint upon me in the future."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Verily, Kassapa, transgression overcame you,<br/>
					such was your folly,<br/>
					your infatuation,<br/>
					your wrong-doing,<br/>
					in that,<br/>
					while I was instructing,<br/>
					inciting<br/>
					and gladdening the monks<br/>
					with a religious talk<br/>
					suitable to the keeping of the precepts,<br/>
					you did not approve<br/>
					but were dissatisfied,<br/>
					and thought:<br/>
					'This recluse is much too scrupulous'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, Kassapa,<br/>
					since you have seen your transgression as such<br/>
					and made confession as is right,<br/>
					we do accept this of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Growth verily, Kassapa, is this<br/>
					in the discipline of an Ariyan,<br/>
					when, having seen one's transgression as such,<br/>
					he makes confession thereof as is right,<br/>
					and in future practises self-restraint.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Now, Kassapa,<br/>
					if an elder monk be not desirous of the training,<br/>
					if he speak not in praise<br/>
					of undertaking the training,<br/>
					and if other monks also<br/>
					are not desirous of the training<br/>
					and he do not incite them to undertake it,<br/>
					and if he speak not in praise thereof<br/>
					what is true and real<br/>
					at the proper time<br/>
					to those monks who are desirous of the training, -<br/>
					of such an elder monk, Kassapa,<br/>
					I utter no praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because other monks would keep company with him, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Master speaks in praise of him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those who should keep company with him<br/>
					would come to share his views.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they should do so<br/>
					it would be to their loss and sorrow for many a day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Kassapa,<br/>
					I speak not in praise of such an elder monk.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Again, Kassapa, if a monk of middle standing be not desirous of the training,<br/>
					if he speak not in praise<br/>
					of undertaking the training,<br/>
					and if other monks also<br/>
					are not desirous of the training<br/>
					and he do not incite them to undertake it,<br/>
					and if he speak not in praise thereof<br/>
					what is true and real<br/>
					at the proper time<br/>
					to those monks who are desirous of the training, -<br/>

					I utter no praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they should do so<br/>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Kassapa,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If likewise a novice be not desirous of the training,<br/>
					if he speak not in praise<br/>
					of undertaking the training,<br/>
					and if other monks also<br/>
					are not desirous of the training<br/>
					and he do not incite them to undertake it,<br/>

					<p class="f4">7. But, Kassapa, if an elder monk be desirous of the training,<br/>
					if he speak in praise of undertaking the training,<br/>
					if he incite other monks,<br/>
					not so desirous,<br/>
					to undertake it,<br/>
					if he speak in praise of it<br/>
					praise which is true and real<br/>
					at the proper <span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span> time<br/>
					to those who are so desirous, -<br/>
					of such an one I utter praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because other monks would keep company with him, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Master praises him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now they who should keep company with him<br/>
					would come to share his views.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they should do so<br/>
					it would be to their profit and happiness for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Kassapa,<br/>
					I speak in praise of such an elder monk.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Again, Kassapa, if a monk of middle standing be desirous of the training,<br/>
					if he speak in praise of undertaking the training,<br/>
					if he incite other monks,<br/>
					not so desirous,<br/>

					if he speak in praise of it<br/>

					<p class="f4">Again, Kassapa, if a novice monk be desirous of the training,<br/>
