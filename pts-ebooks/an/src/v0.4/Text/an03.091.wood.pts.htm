					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three urgent<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> duties of a yeoman farmer.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the yeoman farmer<br/>
					gets his field well ploughed and harrowed<br/>
					very quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so<br/>
					he puts in his seed<br/>
					very quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done that<br/>
					he lets the water in<br/>
					and turns it off<br/>
					very quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are his three urgent duties.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, that yeoman farmer<br/>
					has no such magic power or authority<br/>
					as to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my crops spring up today.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tomorrow let them ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the following day let them ripen.'</p>

					<p class="f4">No!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the due season<br/>
					which makes them do this.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. In the same way<br/>
					there are these three urgent duties of a monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The undertaking of the training<br/>
					in the higher morality,<br/>
					in the higher thought<br/>
					and in the higher insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are his three urgent duties.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the monk<br/>
					has no such magic power or authority<br/>
					as to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Today let my mind be released from the āsavas without grasping,<br/>
					or tomorrow,<br/>
					or the day following.'</p>

					<p class="f4">No!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the due season<br/>
					which releases his mind,<br/>
					as he undergoes the training<br/>
					in the higher morality,<br/>
					in the higher thought<br/>
					and in the higher insight.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span> Wherefore, monks,<br/>
					thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Keen shall be our desire<br/>
					to undertake the training<br/>
					in the higher morality,<br/>
					in the higher thought<br/>
					and in the higher insight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how ye must train yourselves."</p>
