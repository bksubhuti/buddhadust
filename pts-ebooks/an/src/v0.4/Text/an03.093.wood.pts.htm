					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three companies.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The distinguished,<br/>
					the discordant<br/>
					and the harmonious company.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the distinguished company?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, in whatsoever company<br/>
					the elder monks are not luxurious,<br/>
					are not lax,<br/>
					not leaders in backsliding,<br/>
					not shirkers of the burden of the secluded life,<br/>
					but make an effort to win the unattained,<br/>
					to reach the goal not reached,<br/>
					to realize the unrealized, -<br/>
					the generation that follows<br/>
					comes to depend upon their view: -<br/>
					this, monks, is called<br/>
					'the distinguished company.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. And what, monks, is the discordant company?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, in whatsoever company<br/>
					the monks dwell quarrelsome,<br/>
					wrangling,<br/>
					disputatious,<br/>
					wounding each other<br/>
					with the weapons of the tongue, -<br/>
					such a company is called<br/>
					'discordant.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And what, monks, is the harmonious company?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, in whatsoever company<br/>
					the monks dwell together in unity,<br/>
					courteous,<br/>
					without quarrelling,<br/>
					like milk and water mixed,<br/>
					looking on each other<br/>
					with the eye of affection, -<br/>
					such a company is called<br/>
					'harmonious.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Now, monks, at such time<br/>
					as the monks dwell in harmony,<br/>
					courteous<br/>
					without quarrelling,<br/>
					like milk and water mixed,<br/>
					looking on each other<br/>
					with the eye of affection,<br/>
					at such time<br/>
					they beget much merit:<br/>
					at such time, monks,<br/>
					they dwell in the Brahmā-way:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					that is to say,<br/>
					in one who is delighted<br/>
					in the heart's release by sympathy<br/>
					there is <span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span> born joyousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body of the joyous one is calmed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He whose body is calmed feels happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind of the happy man is balanced.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Just as when, monks,<br/>
					on a mountain<br/>
					the rain falls in heavy drops,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					that water flowing onwards<br/>
					according to the slope<br/>
					fills up the mountain-clefts<br/>
					and rifts<br/>
					and gullies,<br/>
					and the mountain-clefts<br/>
					and rifts<br/>
					and gullies when filled<br/>
					fill up the little pools,<br/>
					and the little pools when filled<br/>
					fill up the big pools,<br/>
					and the big pools when filled<br/>
					fill up the small rivers:<br/>
					and the small rivers when filled<br/>
					fill up the large rivers,<br/>
					and the large rivers when filled<br/>
					fill up the sea, -<br/>
					even so at such time<br/>
					as the monks dwell together in unity,<br/>
					courteous,<br/>
					without quarrelling,<br/>
					like milk and water mixed,<br/>
					looking on each other<br/>
					with the eye of affection,<br/>
					at such time they beget much merit:<br/>
					at such time, monks,<br/>
					they dwell in the Brahmā-way:<br/>
					that is to say:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one who is delighted<br/>
					in the heart's release by sympathy<br/>
					there is born joyousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body of the joyous one is calmed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He whose body is calmed feels happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind of the happy man is balanced.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three companies."</p>
