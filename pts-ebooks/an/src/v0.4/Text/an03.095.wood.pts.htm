					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Possessed of three qualities, monks,<br/>
					a rajah's noble thoroughbred steed<br/>
					is worthy of the rajah,<br/>
					a royal possession,<br/>
					and is reckoned an attribute of royalty.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the rajah's noble thoroughbred<br/>
					is blessed with beauty,<br/>
					with strength<br/>
					and speed.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three qualities,<br/>
					possessed of which<br/>
					a rajah's noble thoroughbred steed<br/>
					is worthy of the rajah,<br/>
					a royal possession,<br/>
					and is reckoned an attribute of royalty.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. In like manner, monks,<br/>
					possessed of three things<br/>
					a monk is worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of hospitality,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					of salutations with clasped hands,<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Beauty (of life),<br/>
					strength (of character)<br/>
					and speed (of insight).</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And how is a monk blessed<br/>
					with beauty (of life)?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is moral,<br/>
					he lives restrained<br/>
					with the restraint of the obligations,<br/>
					proficient in the practice of good conduct;<br/>
					seeing danger in trifling faults,<br/>
					he trains himself in the rules<br/>
					by undertaking them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he has beauty (of life).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. And how is a monk blessed<br/>
					with strength (of character)?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells ardent in energy,<br/>
					ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br/>
					to acquire good qualities,<br/>
					strenuously exerting himself,<br/>
					not throwing off the burden<br/>
					in good qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he has strength.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And how is a monk blessed with speed?</p>

						

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, by destroying the five fetters that bind to the lower worlds,<br/>
					is reborn spontaneously (in the Pure Abodes),<br/>
					destined there to pass away,<br/>
					not to return hither from that world.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way a monk is blessed with speed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these three qualities a monk is worthy of offerings<br/>
					worthy of hospitality,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					of salutations with clasped hands,<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world."</p>
