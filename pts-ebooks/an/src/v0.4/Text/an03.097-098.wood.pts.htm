					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a bran-new fibre-cloth<br/>

					painful to handle<br/>

					<p class="f4">So likewise is one of <span class="f2 g"><b>[225]</b></span> middling wear<br/>

					<p class="f4">Just as that fibre-cloth<br/>
