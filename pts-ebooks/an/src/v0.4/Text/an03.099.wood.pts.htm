					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if anyone should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br/>

					<p class="f4">"That water in the cup, lord,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Well, monks, just in the same way<br/>
