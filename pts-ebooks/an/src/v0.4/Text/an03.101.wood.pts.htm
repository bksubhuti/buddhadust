					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Before my enlightenment, monks,<br/>
					when I was yet but a Bodhisat,<br/>
					this occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, I wonder,<br/>
					is the satisfaction in the world,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					what is the misery in the world,<br/>
					what is the escape therefrom?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, this occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That condition in the world<br/>
					owing to which pleasure arises,<br/>
					owing to which arises happiness, -<br/>
					that is the satisfaction in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">That impermanence,<br/>
					that suffering,<br/>
					that changeability in the world, -<br/>
					that is the misery in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">That restraint,<br/>
					that riddance of desire and passion in the world,<br/>
					that is the escape therefrom.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. So long, monks,<br/>
					as I did not thoroughly comprehend,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the satisfaction in the world as such,<br/>
					the misery in the world as such,<br/>
					the escape therefrom as such,<br/>
					so long did I not discern the meaning<br/>
					of<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> being enlightened<br/>
					with perfect enlightenment<br/>
					unsurpassed in the world<br/>
					with its devas,<br/>
					its Maras and Brahmās,<br/>
					together with the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					of devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, when I fully comprehended,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the satisfaction in the world as such,<br/>
					the misery in the world as such,<br/>
					the escape therefrom as such, -<br/>
					then did I discern the meaning<br/>

					with its devas,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then did knowledge and insight arise in me, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sure is my heart's release.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my last birth.</p>
