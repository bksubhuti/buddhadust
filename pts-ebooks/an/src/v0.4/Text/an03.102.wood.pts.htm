					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now herein,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> monks,<br/>
					if there were not satisfaction to be found in the world,<br/>
					beings would not be attached to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But since there is satisfaction in the world,<br/>
					beings are attached thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were not misery in the world,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But since there is misery in the world,<br/>
					beings are repelled by the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were no escape from the world,<br/>
					beings could not escape therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">But since there is an escape from the world,<br/>
					beings do escape therefrom.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, in so far as beings have not fully come to know,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the satisfaction in the world as such,<br/>
					the misery therein as misery,<br/>
					the escape therefrom as such,<br/>
					just so far have they not dwelt free from,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					detached from,<br/>
					released from,<br/>
					with heart unconfined by<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					the world<br/>
					and the devas,<br/>
					the Maras,<br/>
					and Brahmās,<br/>
					together with the host of recluses and brahmins<br/>
					of devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, when beings have fully come to know,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the satisfaction in the world as such,<br/>
					the misery in the world as such,<br/>
					the escape from the world as such, -<br/>
					then, monks, they dwell free,<br/>
					detached,<br/>
					released from,<br/>
					with heart unconfined by the world<br/>
					and the devas,<br/>
					the Maras,<br/>
					and Brahmās,<br/>
					together with the host of recluses and brahmins<br/>
					of devas and mankind.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> under- <span class="f2 g"><b>[239]</b></span> stand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the satisfaction,<br/>
					the misery in the world,<br/>
					and the escape therefrom,<br/>
					such recluses and brahmins<br/>
					in my opinion<br/>
					are not to be regarded as recluses<br/>
					among recluses,<br/>
					nor as brahmins<br/>
					among brahmins:<br/>
					nor have those worthies come to know<br/>
					fully of themselves<br/>
					in this very life<br/>
					the real meaning of recluseship<br/>
					or of brahminhood,<br/>
					nor attaining thereto<br/>
					do they dwell therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, whatsoever recluses and brahmins<br/>
					do so understands it really is,<br/>
