					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Anāthapiṇḍika the housefather came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Housefather, when the thought is unguarded,<br/>
					bodily action also is unguarded,<br/>
					speech and mental action also are unguarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and mental action are unguarded<br/>
					they are saturated with lust.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When these are thus saturated with lust<br/>
					they are rotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they are rotten<br/>
					one's death is not auspicious,<br/>
					one has no happy ending.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather,<br/>
					just as when a peaked house is unthatched<br/>
					the peak is not protected,<br/>
					the roof-beams are not protected,<br/>
					the wall is not protected.</p>

					<p class="f4">The peak,<br/>
					roof-beams<br/>
					and wall are saturated,<br/>
					they are rotten.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, when thought is unguarded,<br/>
					bodily action is unguarded,<br/>
					bodily action also is unguarded,<br/>
					speech and mental action also are unguarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action, speech and mental action are unguarded<br/>
					they are saturated with lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">When these are thus saturated with lust<br/>
					they are rotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they are rotten<br/>
					one's death is not auspicious,<br/>
					one has no happy ending.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, housefather,<br/>
					when thought is guarded,<br/>
					bodily action also is guarded,<br/>
					speech and mental action also are guarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action and the rest are guarded,<br/>
					bodily action, speech and mental action are not saturated with lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">When that is so they are not rotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they are not rotten<br/>
					one's death is auspicious,<br/>
					he has a happy ending.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when a peaked house is well thatched,<br/>
					the peak, roof-beams and wall are protected,<br/>
					they are not saturated,<br/>
					they are not rotten;<br/>
					even so, housefather,<br/>
					when thought is guarded,<br/>
					bodily action also is guarded,<br/>
					speech and mental action also are guarded.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action and the rest are guarded,<br/>
					bodily action, speech and mental action are not saturated with lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">When that is so they are not rotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they are not rotten<br/>
					one's death is auspicious,<br/>
					he has a happy ending."</p>
