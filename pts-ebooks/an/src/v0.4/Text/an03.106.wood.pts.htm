					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Anāthapiṇḍika the housefather came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat the Exalted One said this to the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Housefather, when thought is warped,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					bodily action also is warped,<br/>
					speech and mental action are also warped.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and mental action are warped<br/>
					one's death is not auspicious,<br/>
					one has no happy ending.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, housefather, when a peaked house is ill-thatched,<br/>
					the peak,<br/>
					the roof-beams are warped,<br/>
					the wall is askew.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so housefather, when thought is warped,<br/>
					bodily action also is warped,<br/>
					speech and mental action are also warped.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and mental action are warped<br/>
					one's death is not auspicious,<br/>
					one has no happy ending.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But housefather, when thought is not warped,<br/>
					bodily action also is not warped,<br/>
					speech and mental action are also not warped.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and mental action are not warped<br/>
					one's death is auspicious,<br/>
					one has a happy ending.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, housefather, when a peaked house is well-thatched,<br/>
					the peak,<br/>
					the roof-beams are not warped,<br/>
					the wall is not askew.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so housefather, when thought is not warped,<br/>
					bodily action also is mot warped,<br/>
					speech and mental action are also not warped.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and mental action are not warped<br/>
					one's death is auspicious,<br/>
					one has a happy ending.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Vyapanna,</i> lit. 'gone wrong'; gen. trans. 'malevolent.' <i>Comy.</i> <i>pakatī-bhāvaṃ pajahitvā ṭhitaṃ.</i> Hence the trans. must vary when the word is applied to timber.</p>
