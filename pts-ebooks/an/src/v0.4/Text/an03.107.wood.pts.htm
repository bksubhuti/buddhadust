					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

						

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three causes<br/>
					of the origin of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Lust is a cause of the origin of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Malice is a cause of the origin of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delusion is a cause of the origin of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">An action done in lust,<br/>
					born of lust,<br/>
					caused by lust,<br/>
					originated by lust<br/>
					is not profitable:<br/>
					it is blameworthy,<br/>
					it has sorrow for its result,<br/>
					it conduces to the arising of (further) action,<br/>
					not to the ceasing of action.</p>

					<p class="f4">An action done with malice,<br/>
					born of malice,<br/>
					caused by malice,<br/>
					originated by malice<br/>
					is not profitable:<br/>
					it is blameworthy,<br/>
					it has sorrow for its result,<br/>
					it conduces to the arising of (further) action,<br/>
					not to the ceasing of action.</p>

					<p class="f4">An action done in delusion,<br/>
					born of delusion,<br/>
					caused by delusion,<br/>
					originated by delusion<br/>
					is not profitable:<br/>
					it is blameworthy,<br/>
					it has sorrow for its result,<br/>
					it conduces to the arising of (further) action,<br/>
					not to the ceasing of action.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the three causes of action."</p>
