					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three causes of the origin of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Absence of malice is a cause (which prevents the arising) actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Absence of delusion is a cause (which prevents the arising) actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">An action done without lust,<br/>
