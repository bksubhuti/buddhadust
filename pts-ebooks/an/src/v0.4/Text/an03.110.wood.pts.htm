					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

						
						
					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three causes (which prevent the arising) of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Desire for things<br/>
					which in the past<br/>
					were based on desire,<br/>
					is not generated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Desire for things<br/>
					which in the future<br/>
					will be based on desire,<br/>
					is not generated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Desire for things<br/>
					which in the present time<br/>
					are based on desire,<br/>
					is not generated.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. And how, monks, is desire for things<br/>
					which in the past<br/>
					were based on desire,<br/>
					not generated?</p>

					<p class="f4">One fully understands<br/>
					the future result<br/>
					of things which in the past<br/>
					were based on desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Foreseeing this result<br/>
					one turns away from it,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					and so doing,<br/>
					conceiving no desire<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> for it in the heart,<br/>
					one penetrates it by insight<br/>
					and sees it plain.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how desire for things<br/>
					which in the past<br/>
					were based on desire,<br/>
					is not generated.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And how, monks, is desire<br/>
					which in the future<br/>
					will be based on desire,<br/>
					is not generated?</p>

					<p class="f4">One fully understands<br/>
					the future result<br/>
					of things yet to come<br/>
					which are based on desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Foreseeing this result<br/>
					one turns away from it,<br/>
					and so doing,<br/>
					conceiving no desire for it in the heart,<br/>
					one penetrates it by insight<br/>
					and sees it plain.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how desire for things<br/>
					which in the future<br/>
					will be based on desire,<br/>
					is not generated.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. And how, monks, is desire<br/>
					for things present,<br/>
					which are based on desire,<br/>
					not generated?</p>

					<p class="f4">One fully understands<br/>
					the future result<br/>
					of present things,<br/>
					based on desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Foreseeing this result<br/>
					one turns away from it,<br/>
					and so doing,<br/>
					conceiving no desire for it in the heart,<br/>
					one penetrates it by insight<br/>
					and sees it plain.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how desire<br/>
					for things present<br/>
					which are based on desire<br/>
					is not generated.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three causes<br/>
					(which prevent the arising) of actions."</p>
