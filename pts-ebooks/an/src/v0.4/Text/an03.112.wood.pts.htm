					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the appearance of three persons<br/>
					is hard to find in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The appearance of a Tathāgata,<br/>
					an Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One<br/>
					is hard to be found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">The appearance of a person<br/>
					who can expound the Dhamma-Discipline<br/>
					taught by the Tathāgata<br/>
					is hard to be found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">The appearance of a person<br/>
					who is mindful and grateful<br/>
					is hard to be found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three persons<br/>
					hard to find in the world."</p>
