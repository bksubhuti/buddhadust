					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three sorts of person are found to exist in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person,<br/>
					by utterly transcending consciousness of form,<br/>
					by the disappearsnce of consciousness of resistance,<br/>
					by paying no heed to the diversity of consciousness,<br/>
					regarding space as infinite,<br/>
					reaches up to and abides in the sphere of infinite space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys it, longs for it and finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>
					given thereto,<br/>
					generally spending his time therein<br/>
					and not falling away therefrom,<br/>
					when he makes an end<br/>
					he is reborn in the company<br/>
					of the Devas who have reached the sphere of infinite space.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the life of those Devas is 20,000 cycles.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>
					and spends his lifetime according to the life-span of those Devas:<br/>
					then he goes to Purgatory or to the womb of an animal or to the Realm of Ghosts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But a disciple of the Exalted One,<br/>
					after staying <span class="f2 g"><b>[246]</b></span> there<br/>
					and spending his lifetime according to the life-span of those Devas,<br/>
					finally passes away in that very state.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is  the distinction,<br/>
					the specific feature,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					the difference between the educated Ariyan disciple<br/>
					and the uneducated ordinary man<br/>
					in the matter of destiny and rebirth.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, here we have a certain person who,<br/>
					by utterly transcending the sphere of infinite space,<br/>
					regarding consciousness as infinite,<br/>
					reaches up to and abides in<br/>
					the sphere<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of infinite consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys it, longs for it and finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>
					given thereto,<br/>
					generally spending his time therein<br/>

					when he makes an end<br/>
					he is reborn in the company<br/>
					of the Devas who have reached the sphere of infinite consciousness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the life of those Devas is 40,000 cycles.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>
					and spends his lifetime according to the life-span of those Devas:<br/>
					then he goes to Purgatory or to the womb of an animal or to the Realm of Ghosts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, we have a certain person who, by utterly transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness, with the idea of 'nothing at all exists,' reaches up to and abides in the sphere of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys it, longs for it and finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>
					given thereto,<br/>
					generally spending his time therein<br/>
					and not falling away therefrom,<br/>
					when he makes an end<br/>
					he is reborn in the company<br/>
					of the Devas who have reached the sphere of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the life-span of those Devas is 60,000 cycles.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>
					and spends his lifetime according to the life-span of those Devas:<br/>
					then he goes to Purgatory or to the womb of an animal or to the Realm of Ghosts.</p>
