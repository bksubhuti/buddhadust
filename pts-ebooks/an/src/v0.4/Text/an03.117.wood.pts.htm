					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three failures.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Failure in action,<br/>
					failure in livelihood,<br/>
					failure in view.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[249]</b></span> And of what sort<br/>
					is failure in action?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one<br/>
					takes life,<br/>
					steals,<br/>
					is a wrongdoer in sensual desires,<br/>
					a liar,<br/>
					a slanderer,<br/>
					of bitter speech,<br/>
					an idle babbler.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called 'failure in action.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. And of what sort<br/>
					is failure in livelihood?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one<br/>
					is a wrong liver,<br/>
					gets a livelihood in a wrong way.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'failure in livelihood.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And of what sort<br/>
					is failure in view?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one<br/>
					holds the depraved,<br/>
					the perverse view<br/>
					that there is no (virtue in) almsgiving,<br/>
					in sacrifice,<br/>
					in offerings:<br/>
					that there is no fruit,<br/>
					no result<br/>
					of good and evil deeds:<br/>
					that this world is not,<br/>
					that there is no world beyond:<br/>
					that there is no mother,<br/>
					no father,<br/>
					no beings of spontaneous birth:<br/>
					that in the world are no recluses and brahmins<br/>
					who have won the summit,<br/>
					who have won perfection,<br/>
					who of themselves<br/>
					by their own intuitional powers<br/>
					have realized the world beyond<br/>
					and can proclaim it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					'failure in view.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three failures.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Monks, there are these three successes.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Success in action,<br/>
					success in livelihood,<br/>
					success in view.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now of what sort<br/>
					is success in action?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one<br/>
					abstains from taking life<br/>
					abstains from stealing,<br/>
					abstains from wrongdoing in sensual desires,<br/>
					abstains from lies,<br/>
					abstains from slander,<br/>
					abstains from bitter speech,<br/>
					abstains from idle babble.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'success in action.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And of what sort<br/>
					is success in livelihood?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one<br/>
					is a right liver,<br/>
					he gets a livelihood in a right way.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'success in livelihood.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">7. And of what sort<br/>
					is success in view?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one has right view:<br/>
					he holds with certainty<br/>
					that there is (virtue in) almsgiving,<br/>
					in sacrifice,<br/>
					in offerings:<br/>
					that there is fruit and result<br/>
					of good and evil deeds:<br/>
					that this world is,<br/>
					that there is a world beyond:<br/>
					that mother,<br/>
					father<br/>
					and beings of spontaneous birth do exist:<br/>
					that in the world there are recluses and brahmins<br/>
					who have won the summit,<br/>
					who have won perfection,<br/>
					who of themselves<br/>
					by their own intuitional powers<br/>
					have realized the world beyond<br/>
					and can proclaim it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					'success in view.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three successes."</p>
