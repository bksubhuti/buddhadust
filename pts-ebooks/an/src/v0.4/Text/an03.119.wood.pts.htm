					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three forms of<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Purity of body,<br/>
					purity of speech,<br/>
					purity of mind.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. And of what sort is purity of body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk abstains from taking life,<br/>
					from stealing,<br/>
					from sinful<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> living.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called 'purity of body.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And of what sort is purity of speech?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one<br/>
					abstains from falsehood,<br/>
					slander,<br/>
					bitter speech,<br/>
					idle babble.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'purity of speech.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. And of what sort is purity of mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, if he have some personal sensual desire, is aware:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is in me personal sensual desire.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If there be no personal sensual desire, is aware:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is in me no personal sensual desire.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is aware of how the arising of sensual desire not yet arisen comes about,<br/>
					and how it is abandoned when arisen,<br/>
					and how in the future there is no such arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. If he have some personal malevolence, he is aware:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is within me personal malevolence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If there be no personal malevolence, is aware:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is in me no personal malevolence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is aware of how the arising of malevolence not yet arisen comes about,<br/>

					<p class="f4">6. If he have some personal sloth-and-torpor, he is aware:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is within me personal sloth-and-torpor.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is in me no personal sloth-and-torpor.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is aware of how the arising of sloth-and-torpor not yet arisen comes about,<br/>

					<p class="f4">7. If he have some personal excitement-and-flurry, he is aware:</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is aware of how the arising of excitement-and-flurry not yet arisen comes about,<br/>
					and how it is abandoned when arisen,<br/>

					<p class="f4">8. If he have some personal doubt-and-wavering, he is aware:</p>
