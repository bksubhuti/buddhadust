					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Kusināra<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> in the Wood of Offerings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose now a monk lives dependent<br/>
					on some village or district.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a housefather<br/>
					or his son<br/>
					comes to visit him<br/>
					and invites him to take his meal for the day.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he is willing to do so<br/>
					the monk consents.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the night has passed<br/>
					he robes himself in good time,<br/>
					and taking bowl<br/>
					and outer robe<br/>
					sets out for the house<br/>
					of that housefather<br/>
					or housefather's son.</p>

					<p class="f4">On getting there<br/>
					he sits down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[252]</b></span> Then that housefather<br/>
					or housefather's son<br/>
					serves him with choice food<br/>
					both hard and soft<br/>
					with his own hands,<br/>
					till he has eaten his fill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A good thing in sooth for me<br/>
					to be thus served<br/>
					by a housefather<br/>
					or housefather's son!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I should indeed be glad<br/>
					to have this housefather<br/>
					or housefather's son<br/>
					serve me in like manner<br/>
					in the future.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he enjoys that almsgiving<br/>
					and is attracted<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> by it,<br/>
					infatuated with it,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					attached<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sees not danger therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blind<br/>
					to the escape therefrom.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The result is<br/>
					that his train of thought is sensual,<br/>
					malevolent<br/>
					and harmful to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I declare<br/>
					that what is given to such a monk<br/>
					has no great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the monk lives amiss.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But take the case<br/>
					where a monk lives dependent<br/>
					on some village or district.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a housefather<br/>
					or his son<br/>
					comes to visit him<br/>
					and invites him to take his meal for the day.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he is willing to do so<br/>
					the monk consents.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the night has passed<br/>
					he robes himself in good time,<br/>
					and taking bowl<br/>
					and outer robe<br/>
					sets out for the house<br/>
					of that housefather<br/>
					or housefather's son.</p>

					<p class="f4">On getting there<br/>
					he sits down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that housefather<br/>
					or housefather's son<br/>
					serves him with choice food<br/>
					both hard and soft<br/>
					with his own hands,<br/>
					till he has eaten his fill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now no such thoughts occur to him as these:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A good thing in sooth for me<br/>
					to be thus served<br/>
					by a housefather<br/>
					or housefather's son!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I should indeed be glad<br/>
					to have this housefather<br/>
					or housefather's son<br/>
					serve me in like manner<br/>
					in the future.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys that almsgiving<br/>
					without being attracted by it,<br/>
					infatuated with it<br/>
					or attached thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sees the danger therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not blind to the escape therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">The result is<br/>
					that his train of thought<br/>
					is dispassionate,<br/>
					not malevolent,<br/>
					but harmless to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I declare<br/>
					that what is given to such a monk as this<br/>
					has great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the monk lives vigilant."</p>
