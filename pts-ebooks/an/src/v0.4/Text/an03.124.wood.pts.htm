					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[254]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was going his rounds among the Kosalans and came to Kapilavatthu.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> heard the news:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They say the Exalted One has reached Kapilavatthu."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Mahānāma the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus stood,<br/>
					the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[255]</b></span> "Go you, Mahānāma, and find out some lodging<br/>
					where I may spend this one night."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, lord," replied Mahānāma the Sakyan<br/>
					and went to Kapilavatthu;<br/>
					where, though he searched all through the town,<br/>
					he could not find a proper lodging for the Exalted One<br/>
					in which to spend that one night.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he returned to where the Exalted One was and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Lord, there is no proper lodging<br/>
					wherein the Exalted One may spend this one night.</p>

					<p class="f4">But here is Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					who was once a co-disciple in the holy life<br/>
					with the Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One spend this one night<br/>
					in his hermitage."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go then, Mahānāma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Spread a mat (for me there)."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, lord," replied Mahānāma the Sakyan<br/>
					and went off to the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman.</p>

					<p class="f4">On getting there he spread a mat,<br/>
					set water ready for feet-washing<br/>
					and returned to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the mat is spread.</p>

					<p class="f4">Water is set for feet-washing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One do as he deems seasonable."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. So the Exalted One went to the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arriving there he sat down on a seat made ready and so sitting had his feet washed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this thought occurred to Mahānāma the Sakyan:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is unseasonable to wait upon the Exalted One now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is weary.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tomorrow I will wait upon him."</p>

					<p class="f4">So saluting the Exalted One by the right he departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the night was gone<br/>
					Mahānāma the Sakyan went to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat, the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Mahānāma, there are these three teachers found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span> Herein, Mahānāma, a teacher preaches full comprehension<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> of the sense-desires,<br/>
					but not of the objects of sense,<br/>
					nor of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, Mahānāma, a certain teacher preaches full comprehension of sense-desires<br/>
					and of the objects of sense,<br/>
					but not of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">While yet another teacher preaches the full comprehension<br/>
					of all three.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three teachers found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now of these three, Mahānāma,<br/>
					is the conclusion one and the same<br/>
					or is it different?</p>

					<p class="f4">5. At these words Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman said to Mahānāma the Sakyan:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say it is one and the same, Mahānāma."</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereat the Exalted One said to Mahānāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say it is different,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> Mahānāma."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time Bharandu said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say it is different, Mahānāma."</p>

					<p class="f4">And again the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say it is one and the same, Mahānāma."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Then a third time Bharandu said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say it is different, Mahānāma."</p>

					<p class="f4">And again the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say it is one and the same, Mahānāma."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereupon it occurred to Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here am I even to the third time<br/>
					slighted by Gotama the recluse<br/>
					in the presence of Mahānāma the Sakyan,<br/>
					a man of great importance.</p>

					<p class="f4">I had better leave Kapilavatthu."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman left Kapilavatthu,<br/>
					and in thus departing from Kapilavatthu<br/>
					he was gone for good<br/>
					and came not back any more.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>
