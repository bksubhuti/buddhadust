					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Hatthaka, <span class="f2 g"><b>[257]</b></span> son of a deva,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					when night was waning,<br/>
					lit up the whole of Jeta Grove<br/>
					with exceeding great splendour<br/>
					and approached the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will stand in the presence of the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">But he sank down,<br/>
					collapsed,<br/>
					could not stand upright.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as butter or oil,<br/>
					when poured upon sand,<br/>
					sinks down,<br/>
					sinks in,<br/>
					cannot abide,<br/>
					even so was Hatthaka,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> son of a deva,<br/>
					thinking to stand in the presence of the Exalted One,<br/>
					unable to do so,<br/>
					but sank down,<br/>
					collapsed<br/>
					and could not stand upright.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then the Exalted One said<br/>
					to Hatthaka, son of a deva:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Create a gross<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> body-form, Hatthaka."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, lord," replied Hatthaka,<br/>
					and doing as he was bid<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus stood<br/>
					the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Hatthaka, do things<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> go on<br/>
					just the same now as before,<br/>
					when you were in human form?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord, they do.</p>

					<p class="f4">But there are also things going on<br/>
					which I did not experience<br/>
					when I was in human form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, lord,<br/>
					the Exalted One now dwells<br/>
					surrounded by monks and nuns,<br/>
					by lay-followers male and female,<br/>
					by rulers and royal ministers,<br/>
					by sectarians and their followers,<br/>
					even so do I dwell<br/>
					surrounded by devas' sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even from a distance, lord,<br/>
					do devas' sons come,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We'll hear Dhamma<br/>
					from the lips of Hatthaka,<br/>
					the devas' son!'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Of three things, lord,<br/>
					I never had enough.</p>

					<p class="f4">I died regretful of three things.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">I never had enough<br/>
					of beholding the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">I died regretting it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">I never had <span class="f2 g"><b>[258]</b></span> enough<br/>
					of bearing true Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">I died regretting it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">I never bad enough<br/>
					of serving the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">I died regretting it.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three things, lord."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">(Then he sang these verses:)</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"I never could be sated of delight<br/>
							Of my desire to see the Exalted One,<br/>
							To hear true Dhamma, to wait upon the Order.<br/>
							In higher morals training, fain to hear<br/>
							True Dhamma, never sated in three things,<br/>
							Fared Hatthaka to world of Aviha."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
