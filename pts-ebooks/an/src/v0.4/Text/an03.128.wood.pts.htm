					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[260]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Benares at Isipatana,<br/>
					in Antelope Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Anuruddha went to see the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously, and,<br/>
					after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Anuruddha said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here in this world, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					with the deva-sight,<br/>
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br/>
					I can see the thousandfold world-system.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strenuous and unshaken is my energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindfulness is set up in me untroubled.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">My body is calmed, not perturbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">My mind is collected, one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet for all that<br/>
					my heart is not released from the āsavas<br/>
					without grasping."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Well, Anuruddha,<br/>
					as to your statement about seeing the thousandfold world-system,<br/>
					that is just your conceit.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to your statement about being strenuous and unshaken <span class="f2 g"><b>[261]</b></span> and so forth,<br/>
					- that is just arrogance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to your statement about your heart not being released from the āsavas,<br/>
					that is just worrying.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It would indeed be well for the venerable Anuruddha<br/>
					if he were to abandon these three conditions,<br/>
					if he were not to think about them,<br/>
					but were to focus his mind on the deathless element."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">3. So later on the venerable Anuruddha abandoned these three conditions,<br/>
					paid no attention to them,<br/>
					but focussed his mind on the deathless element.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it came to pass that the venerable Anuruddha,<br/>
					living alone, secluded, earnest, ardent and aspiring,<br/>
					in no long time attained the goal supreme of the holy life,<br/>
					for which clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless:<br/>
					even in this very life he himself by his own intuitional powers realized it,<br/>
					and having attained it dwelt therein,<br/>
					for he knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Birth is destroyed:<br/>
					lived is the holy life:<br/>
					done is my task:<br/>
					for me there is no more of being thus."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Anuruddha was yet another of the arahants.</p>
