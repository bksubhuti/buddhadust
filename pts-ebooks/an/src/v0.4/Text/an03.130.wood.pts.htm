					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who is like carving on a rock,<br/>
					he who is like carving on the ground,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br/>
					is always getting angry.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover that anger of his lasts long.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a rock-carving<br/>

					or water<br/>
					or by lapse of time,<br/>
					even so is the anger of him<br/>

					and his anger lasts long.</p>

					<p class="f4">This person is called<br/>
					'one like carving on a rock.'</p>

					<p class="f4">2. And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is he who is like carving on the ground?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br/>
					is always getting angry,<br/>
					but his anger lasts not long.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a tracing on the ground<br/>
					is soon erased<br/>
					by wind<br/>
					or water<br/>
					or by lapse of time,<br/>
					even so is the anger of him<br/>
					that is always getting angry,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br/>
					'one like carving on the ground.'</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is he who is like carving on water?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person,<br/>
					though he be harshly<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> spoken to,<br/>
					sharply spoken to,<br/>
					rudely spoken to,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Just as what is carved on water<br/>

					even so, monks,<br/>
					here we have a certain person<br/>

					yet is he easily reconciled,<br/>
					he becomes agreeable and friendly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one is called<br/>
