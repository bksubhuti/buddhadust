					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward has translated both <i>'sankhāra'</i> and <i>'dhamma'</i> as 'phenomena'. The distinction is significant. All that is own-made (or constructed) is pain; all that is own-made changes; all things are not-self. But all things are not pain, nor do all things change (e.g., Nibbana or the heart freed from things of Time).</p>
