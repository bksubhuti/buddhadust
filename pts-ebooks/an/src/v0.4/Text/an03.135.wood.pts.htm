					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, just as the hair-blanket<br/>
					is reckoned the meanest<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					of all woven garments whatsoever,<br/>
					— for, monks, the hair-blanket<br/>
					is cold in cold weather,<br/>
					hot in hot weather,<br/>
					ill-coloured,<br/>
					foul-smelling<br/>
					and unpleasant to touch,<br/>
					— even so, of all theories<br/>
					put forward by recluses,<br/>
					that of Makkhali<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					is the meanest.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Makkhali, monks, infatuated man,<br/>
					thus proclaims, holds this view:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'There is no doing of a deed;<br/>
					there is nothing done<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> thereby;<br/>
					there is no energy to do.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, all those<br/>
					who in time past were Arahants,<br/>
					who were Fully Enlightened Ones,<br/>
					all those Exalted Ones<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[266]</b></span> were teachers of the deed,<br/>
					teachers of the efficacy of the deed,<br/>
					of energy to do.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, Makkhali, infatuated man,<br/>
					excludes<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> all of them<br/>
					by his doctrine of:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'There is no doing of a deed:<br/>
					there is nothing done thereby:<br/>
					there is no energy to do.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, all those<br/>
					who in future time shall be Arahants,<br/>
					who were Fully Enlightened Ones,<br/>
					all those Exalted Ones<br/>
					were teachers of the deed,<br/>
					teachers of the efficacy of the deed,<br/>
					of energy to do.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, Makkhali, infatuated man,<br/>
					excludes all of them<br/>
					by his doctrine of:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'There is no doing of a deed:<br/>
					there is nothing done thereby:<br/>
					there is no energy to do.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, I myself who am now Arahant,<br/>
					a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					I am a teacher of the deed,<br/>
					of the efficacy of the deed,<br/>
					of energy to do.</p>

					<p class="f4">Me also does Makkhali, infatuated man,<br/>
					exclude by his doctrine of:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'There is no doing of a deed:<br/>
					there is nothing done thereby:<br/>
					there is no energy to do.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, monks,<br/>
					at the mouth of a river<br/>
					a man should set<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> a fish-trap<br/>
					to the loss, misery, distress<br/>
					and destruction of many fish,<br/>
					even so does Makkhali, that infatuated man,<br/>
					set a man-trap, methinks,<br/>
					for the loss, misery, distress<br/>
					and destruction of many men."</p>
