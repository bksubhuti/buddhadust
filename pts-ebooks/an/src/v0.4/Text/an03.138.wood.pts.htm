					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you<br/>
					the three thoroughbreds<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> among steeds<br/>
					and the three human thoroughbreds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your minds earnestly<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, monks, what are the three thoroughbreds among steeds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain thoroughbred<br/>
					is gifted with speed,<br/>
					but not gifted with beauty,<br/>
					not with gifted good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein also a thoroughbred<br/>
					is gifted with speed,<br/>
					gifted with beauty,<br/>
					but not gifted with good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise we have a certain thoroughbred<br/>
					gifted with speed,<br/>
					gifted with beauty,<br/>
					and gifted with good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three sorts of thoroughbred.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now, monks, what are the three human thoroughbreds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein we have a certain human thoroughbred<br/>
					gifted with speed,<br/>
					but not gifted with beauty,<br/>
					not with gifted good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein we have a certain human thoroughbred<br/>
					gifted with speed,<br/>
					gifted with beauty,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Likewise we have a certain human thoroughbred<br/>

					<p class="f4">3. Now how is a human thoroughbred<br/>
					gifted with speed<br/>
					but not gifted with beauty,<br/>
					not gifted with good proportions?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk,<br/>
					by destroying the five fetters<br/>
					that bind to the lower worlds,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					is reborn spontaneously,<br/>

					his nature is to return from that world no more.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This I call his 'speed'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he be asked a question<br/>
					about extra doctrine<br/>
					or extra discipline,<br/>
					he falters,<br/>
					he cannot solve it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This failure I call his 'lack of beauty.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And suppose that he fails to get offerings<br/>
					of robes and alms-food,<br/>
					lodging,<br/>
					extras<br/>
					and necessary medicines.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I call his 'lack of good proportions.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus we have among men<br/>
