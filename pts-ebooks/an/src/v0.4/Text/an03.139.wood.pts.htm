					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you<br/>
					the three choice,<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> trained<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> steeds and the three choice, trained human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your minds earnestly<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, monks, what are the three choice, trained steeds among steeds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain choice, trained steed<br/>
					is gifted with speed,<br/>
					but not gifted with beauty,<br/>
					not with gifted good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein also a choice, trained steed<br/>
					is gifted with speed,<br/>
					gifted with beauty,<br/>
					but not gifted with good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise we have a certain choice, trained steed<br/>
					gifted with speed,<br/>
					gifted with beauty,<br/>
					and gifted with good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three sorts of choice, trained steed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now, monks, what are the three human choice, trained steeds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein we have a certain human choice, trained steed<br/>
					gifted with speed,<br/>
					but not gifted with beauty,<br/>
					not with gifted good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein we have a certain human choice, trained steed<br/>
					gifted with speed,<br/>
					gifted with beauty,<br/>
					but not gifted with good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise we have a certain human choice, trained steed<br/>
					gifted with speed,<br/>
					gifted with beauty,<br/>
					and gifted with good proportions.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Now how is a human choice, trained steed<br/>
					gifted with speed<br/>
					but not gifted with beauty,<br/>
					not gifted with good proportions?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk,<br/>
					by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/>
					realizes the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					which is free from the āsavas,<br/>
					in this very life<br/>
					by his own intuitional powers,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I call his 'speed.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he be asked a question<br/>
					about extra doctrine<br/>
					or extra discipline,<br/>
					he falters,<br/>
					he cannot solve it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This failure I call his 'lack of beauty.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And suppose that he fails to get offerings<br/>
					of robes and alms-food,<br/>
					lodging,<br/>
					extras<br/>
					and necessary medicines.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I call his 'lack of good proportions.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus we have among men<br/>

					<p class="f4">4. And how is a human choice, trained steed<br/>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This I call his 'speed.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is put a question<br/>
					on extra doctrine and extra discipline,<br/>
					he solves it,<br/>
					he does not falter.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I call his 'gift of beauty.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet he fails to get offerings<br/>

					lodging,<br/>
					extras<br/>

					<p class="f4">This I call his 'lack of good proportions.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus we have among men a choice, trained steed<br/>
					gifted with speed<br/>
					and gifted with beauty<br/>
					but not gifted in good proportions</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And how is a human choice, trained steed<br/>
					gifted with speed<br/>
					and gifted with beauty<br/>
					and gifted in good proportions?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk,<br/>
					by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/>
					realizes the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					which is free from the āsavas,<br/>
					in this very life<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, monks, a choice, trained steed among men is<br/>
					gifted with speed<br/>
					and gifted with beauty<br/>

					<p class="f4">These are the three sorts of choice, trained steed among men.'</p>
