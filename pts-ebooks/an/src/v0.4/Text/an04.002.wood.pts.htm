					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, he who possesses not four qualities<br/>
					is said to be fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who possesses not the Ariyan virtue<br/>
					is said to be fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who possesses not the Ariyan concentration<br/>
					is said to be fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who possesses not the Ariyan wisdom<br/>
					is said to be fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who possesses not the Ariyan release<br/>
					is said to be fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four qualities<br/>
					of him who is said to be fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, he who possesses these four qualities is said not to be fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who possesses the Ariyan virtue<br/>
					is said to be not fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who possesses the Ariyan concentration<br/>
					is said to be not fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who possesses the Ariyan wisdom<br/>
					is said to be not fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who possesses the Ariyan release<br/>
					is said to be  not fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four qualities<br/>
					of him who is said to be fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> At <i>Thag.</i> v. 63; <i>Brethr.,</i> p. 64; <i>cf.</i> <i>Gotama the Man,</i> 87. Our <i>Comy.'s</i> interp. differs from that on <i>Thag.</i> (where birds of prey pounce, <i>patanti,</i> on fallen flesh (<i>cutā</i>) and pounce greedily again). Here, however, <i>Comy.</i> says: <i>Ye cutā, te patanti: ye patitā, te cutā: cutattā patitā, patitattā cutā ti attho.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> I quote Mrs. Rhys Davids's note on <i>Brethr. loc. cit.</i> '<i>i.e.,</i> says the Commentary (ascribed to Dhammapāla): "By the happiness of the <i>attainment</i> of fruition has Nibbāna, which is beyond happiness (or is exceeding great happiness, <i>accanta-sukhaṃ</i>), been won, and by that happiness of insight, which has become a happy mode of <i>procedure,</i> has the bliss of Fruition, of Nibbāna, been reached." The latter interpretation, as Dr. Neumann has pointed out - winning happiness by happiness - is, in the <i>Majjhima-Nikāya</i> (i, 93 <i>f.</i>), contrasted with the Jain point of view: "Nay, friend Gotama, happiness is not to be got at by happiness, but by suffering," - the ascetic standpoint (<i>cf. Further Dialogues,</i> i, 68).' Here our <i>Comy.</i> much less convincingly simply describes a series: 'By human happiness, heavenly happiness: by musing-happiness, the happiness of insight: by this, path-happiness: by path-happiness, fruition-happiness: by this, Nibbāna-happiness is won.'</p>
