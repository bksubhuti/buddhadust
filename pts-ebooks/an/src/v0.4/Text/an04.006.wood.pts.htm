					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monts, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">One of small learning,<br/>
					who profits not by his learning:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					one of small learning,<br/>
					who profits by his learning:<br/>
					one of wide learning,<br/>
					who profits not thereby:<br/>
					one of wide learning,<br/>
					who profits thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what way, monks, is a person of small learning<br/>
					not profited thereby?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain person has small learning in <i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka,</i> <span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span> <i>Abbhutadhammā and Vedalla</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					yet, as of that small learning<br/>
					he knows not the letter,<br/>
					knows not the meaning,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					he does not live in accordance with Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a person of small learning<br/>
					profits not thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what way, monks, is a person of small learning<br/>
					profited thereby?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain person<br/>
					has small learning in <i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhammā and Vedalla</i><br/>
					but, as of that small learning<br/>
					he knows both the letter and the meaning,<br/>
					he lives in accordance with Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a person of small learning<br/>
					profits thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what way, monks, is a person of wide learning<br/>
					not profited thereby?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain person<br/>
					has wide learning in <i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhammā and Vedalla</i><br/>
					but, as of that wide learning<br/>
					he understands neither the letter nor the meaning,<br/>
					he lives not in accordance with Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a person of wide learning<br/>
					profits not thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what way, monks, is a person of wide learning profited thereby?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain person<br/>
					has wide learning <i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhammā and Vedalla</i><br/>
					but, as of that wide learning<br/>
					he understands both the letter and the meaning,<br/>
					he is profited thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a person of wide learning<br/>
					profits thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the four persons found existing in the world.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If one have little learning, and withal<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
							No concentration in his doing,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> men<br/>
							Will blame him both in learning and in deeds.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span> If one have little learning, and withal<br/>
							Much concentration in his doing, men<br/>
							Will praise his deeds, his learning not complete.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">And if one have much learning, and withal<br/>
							No concentration in his doing, men<br/>
							Will blame his deeds, his learning being complete.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">And if one have much learning, and withal<br/>
							Much concentration in his doing, men<br/>
							Will praise him both for learning and for deeds.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The Buddha's deeply learned follower,<br/>
							One who is Dhamma-bearer,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> who is wise<br/>
							And, like the gold of Jambu,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> without blame. -<br/>
							Devas praise him, Brahma too praises him.'</p>
