					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					does not drive them out of renewed existence,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The uddana-title of this vagga is derived from § i, <i>caraṃ</i> (really 'walking'), which embraces the four bodily postures. The sutta occurs at <i>Itiv.</i> 115, where the readings of our text of <i>ce</i> after <i>caraṃ, ṭhito, nisinno</i> are rightly omitted; so also in <i>Sinh.</i> text.</p>
