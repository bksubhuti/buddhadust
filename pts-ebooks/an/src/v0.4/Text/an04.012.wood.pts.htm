					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, do ye live perfect in virtue,<br/>
					do ye live perfect in the performance of the obligations,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligations,<br/>
					perfect in the practice of right behaviour;<br/>
					seeing danger in the slightest faults,<br/>
					undertake and train yourselves<br/>
					in the training of the precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him who so lives perfect in virtue,<br/>
					perfect in the performance of the obligations,<br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligations,<br/>
					perfect in the practice of right behaviour;<br/>
					seeing danger in the slightest faults,<br/>
					who undertakes the training of the precepts,<br/>
					what else remains to be done?</p>

					<p class="f4">If, as he walks,<br/>
					coveting-and-ill-will have vanished from a monk;<br/>
					if sloth-and-torpor,<br/>
					excitement-and-flurry,<br/>
					doubt-and-wavering are abandoned;<br/>
					if his energy be stout and unshaken;<br/>
					if his mindfulness be established and unperturbed;<br/>
					if his body be calm and tranquil,<br/>
					his mind composed and one-pointed, -<br/>
					a monk become thus<br/>
					as he walks<br/>
					is called</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ardent,<br/>
					scrupulous,<br/>
					always and for ever<br/>
					strong in energy<br/>
					and resolute."</p>

					<p class="f4">If, as he stands,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Ardent,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If, as he sits,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Ardent,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If, as he lies awake,<br/>
					coveting-and-ill-will have vanished from a monk;<br/>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whether he walk or stand or sit or lie<br/>
							Or stretch his limbs or draw them in again,<br/>
							Let him do all these things composedly.<br/>

							Of all compounded things attentively.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
							For mind's composure doing what is right,<br/>
							Ever and always training, - "ever intent" -<br/>
							That is the name men give to such a monk.'</p>
