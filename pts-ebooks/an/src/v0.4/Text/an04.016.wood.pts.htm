					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four powers over the subtle.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is possessed of the power to penetrate the <span class="f2 g"><b>[18]</b></span> subtlety of body,<br/>
					and be beholds not any other power<br/>
					more excellent or more refined than that one;<br/>
					he aspires not for any other power<br/>
					to penetrate the subtlety of body<br/>
					more excellent and refined than that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed of the power to penetrate the subtlety of feeling,<br/>
					and be beholds not any other power<br/>
					more excellent or more refined than that one;<br/>
					he aspires not for any other power<br/>
					to penetrate the subtlety of feeling<br/>
					more excellent and refined than that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed of the power to penetrate the subtlety of perception,<br/>
					and be beholds not any other power<br/>
					more excellent or more refined than that one;<br/>
					he aspires not for any other power<br/>
					to penetrate the subtlety of perception<br/>
					more excellent and refined than that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed of the power to penetrate the subtlety of the activities,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>,<br/>
					and be beholds not any other power<br/>
					more excellent or more refined than that one;<br/>
					he aspires not for any other power<br/>
					to penetrate the subtlety of the activities<br/>
					more excellent and refined than that.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Knowing the subtlety of form and knowing<br/>
							How feelings come to be, and whence arises<br/>
							Perception, how it ends, knowing th' activities<br/>
							As other and as ill, but not as self:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
							(These things) if he do see aright, the monk,<br/>
							At peace, delighting in the place of peace,<br/>
							Beareth the final body (in the world),<br/>
							For he hath conquered Mara and his mount.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>
