					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four goings to the no-bourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">One goes to the no-bourn through desire,<br/>
					one goes to the no-bourn through ill-will,<br/>
					one goes to the no-bourn through delusion,<br/>
					one goes to the no-bourn through fear.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Led by desire, ill-will, delusion, fear,<br/>
							If one transgresses Dhamma, his good name<br/>
							Fades as the moon in the dark fortnight wanes.'</p>
