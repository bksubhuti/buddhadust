					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>
					a food-steward is put into Purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes to the no-bourn through desire,<br/>
					he goes to the no-bourn through ill-will,<br/>
					he goes to the no-bourn through delusion,<br/>
					he goes to the no-bourn through fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities,<br/>
					a food-steward is put into Purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>
					a food-steward is put into Heaven<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes not to the no-bourn through desire,<br/>
					he goes not to the no-bourn through ill-will,<br/>
					he goes not to the no-bourn through delusion,<br/>
					he goes not to the no-bourn through fear.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whatever folk are unrestrained in lusts,<br/>
							Not led by Dhamma or respect for Dhamma,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
							Led by desire, ill-will and fear they go:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
							"A blemish to the company"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> they're called.<br/>
							Thus was it said by the Samana who knows.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Therefore those worthy ones and worthy praise<br/>
							Who, fixed in Dhamma, do no evil deed,<br/>
							Not going by desire, ill-will and fear, -<br/>
							"Cream of the company" such ones are called.<br/>
							Thus was it said by the Samana who knows.'</p>
