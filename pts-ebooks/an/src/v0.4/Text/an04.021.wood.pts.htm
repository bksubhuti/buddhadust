					<p><span class="f2">[20]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[20]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'On a certain occasion, monks, I myself was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjarā,<br/>
					under the Goatherds' Banyan,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					just after I had become perfectly enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me then occurred this thought as I was meditating alone:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ill at ease dwells the man who reverences not, obeys not.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> I were to dwell<br/>
					doing honour<br/>
					and paying reverence<br/>
					to some recluse or brahmin,<br/>
					and serving him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, it was I who had this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For the perfection<br/>
					of the sum total of virtues<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> still imperfect<br/>
					I would dwell so doing honour,<br/>
					obeying,<br/>
					reverencing<br/>
					and serving a recluse or brahmin:<br/>
					but not in this world<br/>
					with devas,<br/>
					Maras,<br/>
					Brahmas,<br/>
					not in the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					not in the world of devas and mankind<br/>
					do I behold any other recluse or brahmin<br/>
					more perfect in virtue than myself,<br/>
					whom honouring<br/>
					I could dwell reverencing,<br/>
					obeying<br/>
					and serving him.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the perfection of the sum total of concentration still imperfect<br/>
					I would dwell so doing honour,<br/>
					obeying,<br/>
					reverencing<br/>
					and serving a recluse or brahmin:<br/>
					but not in this world<br/>
					with devas,<br/>
					Maras,<br/>
					Brahmas,<br/>
					not in the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					not in the world of devas and mankind<br/>
					do I behold any other recluse or brahmin<br/>
					more perfect in concentration than myself,<br/>
					whom honouring<br/>
					I could dwell reverencing,<br/>
					obeying<br/>
					and serving him.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the perfection of the sum total of wisdom still imperfect<br/>
					I would dwell so doing honour,<br/>
					obeying,<br/>
					reverencing<br/>
					and serving a recluse or brahmin:<br/>
					but not in this world<br/>
					with devas,<br/>
					Maras,<br/>
					Brahmas,<br/>
					not in the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					not in the world of devas and mankind<br/>
					do I behold any other recluse or brahmin<br/>
					more perfect in wisdom than myself,<br/>
					whom honouring<br/>
					I could dwell reverencing,<br/>
					obeying<br/>
					and serving him.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the perfection of the sum total of release still imperfect<br/>
					I would dwell so doing honour,<br/>
					obeying,<br/>
					reverencing<br/>
					and serving a recluse or brahmin:<br/>
					but not in this world<br/>
					with devas,<br/>
					Maras,<br/>
					Brahmas,<br/>
					not in the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					not in the world of devas and mankind<br/>
					do I behold any other recluse or brahmin<br/>
					more perfect in release than myself,<br/>
					whom honouring<br/>
					I could dwell reverencing,<br/>
					obeying<br/>
					and serving him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[21]</b></span> Then, monks, it was I who had this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose this Dhamma<br/>
					in which I have been perfectly enlightened, -<br/>
					suppose I were to dwell honouring,<br/>
					reverencing,<br/>
					obeying<br/>
					and serving this Dhamma?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>
					knowing the thought that was in my mind,<br/>
					just as a strong man might straighten out his bent arm<br/>
					or bend in his outstretched arm,<br/>
					just so did he vanish from the Brahma<br/>
					world and appear in front of me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>
					placing his outer robe over one shoulder<br/>
					and with his right knee pressing the ground,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					stretched out his joined palms towards me and said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Wellfarer!</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever were in time past arahants,<br/>
					perfectly enlightened ones, lord,<br/>
					those reverend ones also dwelt honouring,<br/>
					reverencing,<br/>
					obeying<br/>
					and serving Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever, lord, in future time shall be arahants,<br/>
					perfectly enlightened ones, lord,<br/>
					those reverend ones shall also dwell honouring,<br/>
					reverencing,<br/>
					obeying<br/>
					and serving Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also now, lord,<br/>
					let the Exalted One who is arahant,<br/>
					a perfectly enlightened one,<br/>
					dwell honouring,<br/>
					reverencing,<br/>
					obeying<br/>
					and serving Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati.</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying he added this further:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The Perfect Buddhas who have passed,<br/>
							The Perfect Buddhas yet to come,<br/>
							The Perfect Buddha who is now,<br/>
							And hath for many banished woe, -<br/>
							All dwelt their dhamma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> honouring,<br/>
							Do dwell<span class="f3"><sup>7</sup></span> and shall dwell: 'tis their way.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
							So he to whom the self is dear,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span> Who longs for the great Self<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> - he<br/>
							Should homage unto Dhamma pay,<br/>
							Remembering the Buddha-word."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying he saluted me<br/>
					and keeping me on his right side<br/>
					vanished there and then.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, seeing that it was the wish of the Brahmā<br/>
					and proper for myself,<br/>
					I dwelt honouring,<br/>
					reverencing,<br/>
					obeying<br/>
					and serving that very Dhamma<br/>
					which had been well comprehended by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks,<br/>
					since the Order has become possessed of greatness,<br/>
					I hold the Order also in strict regard.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>
