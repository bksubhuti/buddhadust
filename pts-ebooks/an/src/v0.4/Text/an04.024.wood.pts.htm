					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Sākete, in Kāḷaka's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span> 'Yes. lord,' replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever in the world,<br/>
					with the world of Maras,<br/>
					Brahmas,<br/>
					together with the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					of devas and mankind,<br/>
					is seen,<br/>
					heard,<br/>
					sensed,<br/>
					cognized,<br/>

					pondered over by the mind, -<br/>
					all that do I know.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever in the world,<br/>
					with the world of Maras,<br/>
					Brahmas,<br/>
					together with the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					of devas and mankind,<br/>
					is seen,<br/>
					heard,<br/>

					searched into,<br/>
					pondered over by the mind, -<br/>
					that have I fully comprehended.</p>

					<p class="f4">All that is understood by the Tathāgata,<br/>
					but the Tathāgata is not subject to it.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I [don't]<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> know whatsoever in the world,<br/>

					<p class="f4">it would be a falsehood in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I both know and know not whatsoever in the world,<br/>
					with the world of Maras,<br/>
					Brahmas,<br/>
					together with the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>

					sensed,<br/>
					cognized,<br/>
					attained,<br/>

					<p class="f4">it would be a falsehood in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I neither know it nor am ignorant of whatsoever in the world,<br/>
					with the world of Maras,<br/>
					Brahmas,<br/>
					together with the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>

					is seen,<br/>

					<p class="f4">it would be a falsehood in me,<br/>
					that would be a fault in me.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a Tathāgata is a seer of what is to be seen,<br/>
					but he has no conceit<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> of what is seen:<br/>
					he has no conceit of what has not been seen,<br/>
					he has no conceit of what is to be seen,<br/>
					he has no conceit about the seer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing what is to be heard,<br/>
					he has no conceit of what has been heard<br/>
					he has no conceit of what has not been heard<br/>
					he has no conceit of what is to be heard,<br/>
					he has no conceit about the hearer.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also sensing what is to be sensed,<br/>
					he has no conceit of what has been sensed<br/>
					he has no conceit of what has not been sensed<br/>
					he has no conceit of what is to be sensed,<br/>
					he has no conceit about he who is the senser.</p>

					<p class="f4">Cognizing the cognizable<br/>
					he has no conceit of the thing cognized<br/>
					he has no conceit of what has not been cognized<br/>
					he has no conceit of what is to be cognized<br/>
					he has no conceit about he who has cognition.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, the Tathāgata,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					being such an one in things seen,<br/>
					heard,<br/>
					sensed,<br/>
					cognized,<br/>
					is "such."</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, than "he who is such "<br/>
					there is none other greater<br/>
					or more excellent,<br/>
					I declare.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span> Whatever is seen, heard, sensed or clung to is esteemed<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward follows the PTS Pali here and does not have this "don't". In the Pali this makes the first statement a lie. If the first statement had been "This the Tathāgata knows"; the second: "This the Tathāgata understands (Woodward's 'fully comprehend'), then the idea might have been the avoidance of the use of "I". But this is not the case in any version of the Pali, and it is a clearly understood principle that the "I" and so forth is permissible to use in conventional speech. Further, the four positions taken with regard to knowing are usually: "I know", "I do not know" "I both know and do not know" and "I neither know nor do not know." But there are only three positions given here. Surely this is the simple error of having neglected to insert the 'na', in the first of the three.</p>
