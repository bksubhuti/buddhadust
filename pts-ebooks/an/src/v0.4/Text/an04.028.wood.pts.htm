					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four Ariyan lineages,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					as of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded,<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk is content<br/>
					with any sort of robes,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and speaks in praise of such content.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the sake of getting robes<br/>
					he resorts not<br/>
					to unseemly and unbecoming conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he gets not robes<br/>
					he is not dismayed thereat:<br/>
					and if he does get them<br/>
					he is free from the bond of selfishness,<br/>
					of greed,<br/>
					of craving for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the danger therein<br/>
					and skilled in the escape<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> therefrom<br/>
					he makes use of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet does he not exalt himself<br/>
					because of his content<br/>
					with any sort of robes,<br/>
					nor does he disparage others<br/>
					(who are not content).</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, monks, is skilled herein,<br/>
					not slothful,<br/>
					but mindful and heedful,<br/>
					this monk is one<br/>
					who stands firm<br/>
					in the primeval, ancient, Ariyan lineage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, a monk is content<br/>
					with any sort of alms-food <span class="f2 g"><b>[31]</b></span><br/>
					and speaks in praise of such content.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the sake of getting alms-food<br/>
					he resorts not<br/>
					to what is unseemly and unbecoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he gets not alms-food<br/>
					he is not dismayed thereat:<br/>
					and if he does get it<br/>
					he is free from the bond of selfishness,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					of greed,<br/>
					of craving for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the danger therein<br/>
					and skilled in the escape therefrom,<br/>
					he makes use of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet does he not exalt himself<br/>
					because of his content<br/>
					with any sort of alms-food,<br/>
					nor does he disparage others<br/>
					(who are not content).</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, monks, is skilled herein,<br/>
					not slothful,<br/>
					but mindful and heedful,<br/>
					this monk is one<br/>
					who stands firm<br/>
					in the primeval, ancient, Ariyan lineage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, a monk is content<br/>
					with any sort of lodging<br/>
					and speaks in praise of such content.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the sake of getting lodging<br/>
					he resorts not<br/>
					to what is unseemly and unbecoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he gets not lodging<br/>
					he is not dismayed thereat:<br/>
					and if he does get it<br/>
					he is free from the bond of selfishness,<br/>
					of greed,<br/>
					of craving for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the danger therein<br/>
					and skilled in the escape therefrom,<br/>
					he makes use of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet does he not exalt himself<br/>
					because of his content<br/>
					with any sort of lodging,<br/>
					nor does he disparage others<br/>
					(who are not content).</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, monks, is skilled herein,<br/>
					not slothful,<br/>
					but mindful and heedful,<br/>
					this monk is one<br/>
					who stands firm<br/>
					in the primeval, ancient, Ariyan lineage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, monks, a monk delights in abandoning.</p>

					<p class="f4">So delighting he delights in making-become.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Yet because of his delight in abandoning<br/>
					and his delight in making-become<br/>
					he exalts not himself because of that delight,<br/>
					nor does he disparage others<br/>
					(who delight not therein).</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, monks, is skilled herein,<br/>
					not slothful,<br/>
					but mindful and heedful,<br/>
					this monk is one<br/>
					who stands firm<br/>
					in the primeval, ancient, Ariyan lineage.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four Ariyan lineages<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					as of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and adulterated now as then;<br/>
					which are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, possessed of these four Ariyan lineages,<br/>
					if a monk dwell in the east<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					he masters discontent<br/>
					and content,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a monk dwell in the west<br/>
					he masters discontent<br/>
					and content, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a monk dwell in the north<br/>
					he masters discontent<br/>
					and content, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a monk dwell in the south<br/>
					he masters discontent<br/>
					and content, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">A sage, monks masters discontent and content.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">No discontent compels the sage,
							The sage no discontent compels:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[32]</b></span> The sage doth discontent compel,<br/>
							Compeller of discontent is he.<br/>
							Him, that all kamma hath decided<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span>
							And scattered it, who shall restrain?<br/>
							Pure as the gold of Jambu he.<br/>
							Who is there can speak blame of him?<br/>
							Even the devas praise that man:<br/>
