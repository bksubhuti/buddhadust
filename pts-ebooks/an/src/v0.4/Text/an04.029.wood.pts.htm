					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four factors of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not-coveting, monks, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not-malice, monks, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right mindfulness, monks, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right concentration, monks, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four factors of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Not covetous, with heart of malice void,<br/>
							A man should dwell, with concentrated mind,<br/>
							With mind one-pointed, in the self controlled.'</p>
