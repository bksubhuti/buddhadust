					<p><span class="f2">[29]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[32]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha on Vultures' Peak Hill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>
					a great number of notable Wanderers<br/>
					were in residence<br/>
					on the bank of the Snake river,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					in the Wanderers' Park,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">the Wanderers Annabhara,<br/>
					Varadhara,<br/>
					Sakuludayin<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and other notable Wanderers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at eventide the Exalted One,<br/>
					arising from his solitary <span class="f2 g"><b>[33]</b></span> musing,<br/>
					went towards the bank of Snake river,<br/>
					where was the Wanderers' Park,<br/>
					and on reaching it<br/>
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat<br/>
					the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to those Wanderers:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wanderers, these four factors of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not-coveting, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not-malice, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right mindfulness, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right concentration, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four factors of Dhamma,<br/>
					reckoned as ancient,<br/>
					of long standing,<br/>
					as traditional,<br/>
					primeval,<br/>
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>
					are not confounded<br/>
					nor shall they be,<br/>
					are not despised<br/>
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Wanderers, if one should thus object:</p>

						

					<p class="f4">"But I could point to a recluse or brahmin who,<br/>
					though he has realized<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> this Dhamma-factor of not-coveting,<br/>
					is nevertheless covetous,<br/>
					strongly passionate in his desires," -</p>

					<p class="f4">of such an one I would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then let him speak out!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him utter speech,<br/>
					and I shall behold his excellence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Wanderers,<br/>
					it is a thing impossible<br/>
					that such a recluse or brahmin,<br/>
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of not-coveting,<br/>
					could be pointed to as covetous,<br/>
					strongly passionate in his desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Wanderers, if one should thus object:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I could point to a recluse or brahmin who,<br/>
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of not-malice,<br/>
					is yet malevolent of heart,<br/>
					of corrupt thoughts," -</p>

					<p class="f4">of such an one I would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then let him speak out!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him utter speech,<br/>
					and I shall behold his excellence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Wanderers,<br/>
					it is a thing impossible<br/>
					that such an one,<br/>
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of not-malice,<br/>
					could be pointed to as malevolent of heart,<br/>
					as of corrupt thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Wanderers, if one should thus object:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I could point to a recluse or brahmin who,<br/>
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of right mindfulness,<br/>
					is nevertheless distracted and uncontrolled," -</p>

					<p class="f4">of such an one I would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let him speak out!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him utter speech,<br/>
					and I shall behold his excellence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Wanderers,<br/>
					it is a thing impossible<br/>
					that such an one,<br/>
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of right mindfulness,<br/>
					could be pointed to<br/>
					as distracted and uncontrolled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Wanderers, if one should thus object:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I could point to a recluse or brahmin who,<br/>
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of right concentration,<br/>
					is nevertheless not concentrated but flighty-minded," -</p>

					<p class="f4">of such an one I would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then let him speak out!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him utter speech,<br/>
					and I shall behold his excellence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Wanderers,<br/>
					it is a thing impossible<br/>
					that such an one,<br/>
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of right mindfulness,<br/>
					could be pointed to<br/>
					as not concentrated but flighty-minded.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span> Now, Wanderers, whoso should think<br/>
					he ought to censure and despise<br/>
					these four Dhamma-factors<br/>
					of not-coveting,<br/>
					not-malice,<br/>
					right mindfulness<br/>
					and right concentration, -<br/>
					I say that in this very life<br/>
					four righteous reproaches,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					occasions for censure,<br/>
					come upon that man.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">If your reverence despises,<br/>
					censures the Dhamma-factor of not-coveting,<br/>
					then (it follows that) those recluses and brahmins who are covetous,<br/>
					strongly passionate in desires,<br/>
					must be honoured by your reverence,<br/>
					must be praised by your reverence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if your reverence censures,<br/>
					despises the Dhamma-factor of not-malice,<br/>
					then (it follows) that those recluses and brahmins who are malevolent of heart,<br/>
					corrupt in thought,<br/>
					must be honoured by your reverence,<br/>
					must be praised by your reverence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if your reverence censures,<br/>
					despises the Dhamma-factor of right mindfulness,<br/>
					then (it follows that) those recluses and brahmins who are distracted and uncontrolled<br/>
					must be honoured by your reverence,<br/>
					must be praised by your reverence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if your reverence censures,<br/>
					despises the Dhamma-factor of right concentration,<br/>
					then (it follows that) those recluses and brahmins who are not concentrated<br/>
					but flighty-minded<br/>
					must be honoured by your reverence,<br/>
					must be praised by your reverence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Wanderers, whosoever<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> should think he ought to censure and despise<br/>
					these four factors of Dhamma,<br/>
					I say that in this very life<br/>
					these four righteous reproaches,<br/>
					occasions for censure,<br/>
					come upon that man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, Wanderers, even, the men of Ukkala,<br/>
					Vassa and Bhanna,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					who were deniers of the cause,<br/>
					deniers of the deed,<br/>
					deniers of reality, -<br/>
					even they did not judge it fit<br/>
					to censure and despise<br/>
					these four Dhamma-factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they feared blame,<br/>
					attack,<br/>
					reproach.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[35]</b></span> Without ill-will and mindful ever,<br/>
							Who in the self <i>(ajjhattaṃ)</i> is well composed,<br/>
							Who trains to discipline his greed, -<br/>
							He is the one called "diligent."'</p>
