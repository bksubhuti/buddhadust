					<p><span class="f2">[33]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[36]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the lion, king of beasts,<br/>
					at eventide comes forth from his lair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having come forth from his lair<br/>
					he stretches himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having stretched himself<br/>
					he surveys the four quarters in all directions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having surveyed the four quarters in all directions<br/>
					he utters thrice his lion's roar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thrice having uttered his lion's roar<br/>
					he sallies forth in search of prey.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, whatsoever brute creatures<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					hear the sound of the roaring of the lion,<br/>
					king of beasts,<br/>
					for the most part<br/>
					they are afraid:<br/>
					they fall to quaking and trembling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those that dwell in holes seek them:<br/>
					water-dwellers make for the <span class="f2 g"><b>[37]</b></span> water:<br/>
					forest-dwellers enter the forest:<br/>
					birds mount into the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, whatsoever rajah's elephants<br/>
					in village,<br/>
					town,<br/>
					or rajah's residence<br/>
					are tethered with stout leathern bonds,<br/>
					such burst and rend those bonds asunder,<br/>
					void their excrements<br/>
					and in panic<br/>
					run to and fro.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus potent, monks, is the lion,<br/>
					king of beasts,<br/>
					over brute creatures:<br/>
					of such mighty power and majesty is he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, monks, when a Tathāgata arises in the world,<br/>
					an Arahant,<br/>
					a Perfectly Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in lore and conduct,<br/>
					Wellfarer,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					the trainer unsurpassed<br/>
					of men who can be trained,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One, -<br/>
					he teaches Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such is the person-pack:<br/>
					such the origin of the person-pack:<br/>
					such is the ending of the person-pack:<br/>
					such is the practice going to end the person-pack."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, whatsoever devas there be,<br/>
					long-lived,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					and become happy,<br/>
					for a long time established in lofty palaces,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					they too,<br/>
					on hearing the Dhamma-teaching of the Tathāgata,<br/>
					for the most part<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> are afraid:<br/>
					they fall to quaking and trembling,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It seems, sirs,<br/>
					that we who thought ourselves permanent<br/>
					are after all impermanent:<br/>
					that we who thought ourselves stable<br/>
					are after all unstable:<br/>
					not to last, sirs, it seems are we:<br/>
					and lasting we thought ourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it seems, sirs,<br/>
					that we are impermanent,<br/>
					unstable,<br/>
					not to last,<br/>
					compassed about with a person-pack.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus potent, monks, is a Tathāgata<br/>
					over the world of devas and mankind:<br/>
					of such mighty power and majesty is he.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span> When a Buddha, fully knowing,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
							Sets the Dhamma-wheel a-rolling-<br/>

							Of the devas and the world-<br/>
							Teaching that the framework<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> ceases<br/>
							And the framework comes to be,<br/>
							And the Ariyan Eightfold Way<br/>
							That leads to calming of all Ill, -<br/>
							Devas, they who live for ages,<br/>
							Beauteous, of great renown,<br/>
							Like the beasts before the lion,<br/>
							Fall a-trembling, are afraid;<br/>
							For they have not done with framework.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
							"Transient, friends," say they, "are we,"<br/>
							When as they hear the Arahant's words,<br/>
							Of such an one who well is freed.'</p>
