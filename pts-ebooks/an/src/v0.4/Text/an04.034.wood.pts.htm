					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four best faiths.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as compared with creatures,<br/>
					whether footless,<br/>
					bipeds,<br/>
					quadrupeds,<br/>
					or those with many feet,<br/>
					with form<br/>
					or void of form,<br/>
					with sense<br/>
					or void of sense<br/>
					or indeterminate in sense,<br/>
					a Tathāgata,<br/>
					an Arahant,<br/>
					a Fully Enlightened One<br/>
					is reckoned best of them.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					of those who have faith in the best<br/>
					the result is best.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as compared with things compounded,<br/>
					the Ariyan eightfold way<br/>
					is reckoned best of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">They who have faith in the Ariyan eightfold way<br/>
					have faith in the best:<br/>
					of those who have faith in the best<br/>
					the result is best.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as compared with things compounded<br/>
					or not compounded,<br/>
					freedom from passion<br/>
					is reckoned best of them,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					the subduing of pride in self,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					the restraint of thirst,<br/>
					the removal of clinging,<br/>
					the cutting off of the base of rebirth,<br/>
					the destruction of craving,<br/>
					freedom from passion,<br/>
					ending,<br/>
					Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">They who have faith in Dhamma<br/>
					(which is passionless)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

					of those who have faith in the best<br/>
					the result is best.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as compared with orders and companies,<br/>
					the Order of a Tathāgata's disciples is reckoned best,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight types of men,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					that is,<br/>
					the Exalted One's Order of disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>

					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, they who have faith in the Order<br/>
					have faith in the best:<br/>
					of those who have faith in the best<br/>

					<p class="f4">These are the four faiths.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Of those who have faith at its best,<br/>
							Who comprehend best Dhamma,<br/>

							Of those who have faith in Dhamma,<br/>
							Passionless, calming, blissful:<br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[40]</b></span> Of those who have faith in the Order,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Pasādā.</i> This sutta occurs at <i>Itiv.</i> 87 (and is included at <i>A.</i> iii, 36) in three sections; but to make it a Four the Eightfold Way is here inserted, but this is not in the gāthas, which are the same in all three books. The gāthas deal with the 'triple gem' and charity (four bests). It is also curious that <i>Comy.</i> does not mention the gāthas either here or at <i>A.</i> iii. Have they been added from Itivuttaka (which for several reasons I conclude to be an older collection than <i>Aṅguttara</i>)? Or does this show that the prose part is later than, or written up to, the gāthas (a thing which evidently has been done in some cases, not to mention the Jātaka <i>Comy.</i>)? <i>Comy.</i> on <i>Ratana-sutta</i> of <i>Khuddaka-P.</i> <i>(KhpA)</i> quotes our sutta several times.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Quoted <i>Vis. Mag.</i> i, 293, where yāvatā (an adverb) is incorrectly taken as a pronoun, as also in our <i>Comy.</i> Text omits 'that is' <i>(yad idaṃ),</i> which is in the <i>Itiv.</i> text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Mada-nimmadana = māna-mada-purisa-mada,</i> acc. to <i>VM.</i> <i>loc. cit.;</i> but our <i>Comy.</i> <i>rāga-mada.</i> We cannot help noting that all these negative virtues are regarded as the best things.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Virāge (dhamme),</i> not in text, but at <i>A.</i> iii, 36 and <i>Itiv.</i> 87" <i>Cf.</i> Vimāna V. 51, <i>rāga-virāgam anejam asohaṃ dhammaṃ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Purisa-pugglā.</i> <i>Comy.</i> does not notice this either here or at <i>A.</i> iii, 36. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Dial.</i> iii, 238: those on the four paths, together with those who have won the fruits thereof.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> v, 296 ff., where the Buddha remarks that the winning of four continents is not worth one-quarter of a quarter of these four.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Aggassa dātā is taken by <i>Comy.</i> on <i>Sn.</i> 217 (<i>SnA.</i> ii, 270) as 'off the top,' 'first-fruits.' <i>Cf.</i> A. iii, 42, 61 <i>(agga-dāyī)</i>.</p>
