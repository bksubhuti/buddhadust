					<p><span class="f2">[37]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was journeying along the high road between Ukkaṭṭhā and Setabbya.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahmin Doṇa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> was also journeying along the high road between Ukkaṭṭhā and Setabbya.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Doṇa, beheld on the footprints of the Exalted One the wheel-marks<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> with their thousand spokes, with their rims and hubs and all their attributes complete.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing these he thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful indeed! It is marvellous indeed! These will not be the footprints of one in human form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just then the Exalted One stepped aside from the high road and sat down at the root of a certain tree, sitting cross-legged, holding his body upright and setting up mindfulness in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Doṇa, following up the Exalted One's footprints, beheld the Exalted One seated at the foot of a certain tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing him comely, faith-inspiring,<span class="f3"><sup>5</sup></span> with senses calmed, tranquil of mind, in the attainment of composure by masterly control, (like) a tamed, alert, perfectly trained<span class="f3"><sup>6</sup></span> elephant,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> he approached the Exalted One and drawing near to him said this:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span> 'Your worship will become<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> a deva?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No indeed, brahmin. I'll not become a deva."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then your worship will become a gandharva?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No indeed, brahmin, I'll not become a gandharva."</p>

					<p class="f4">"A yakkha, then?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No indeed, brahmin, not a yakkha."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then your worship will become a human being?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No indeed, brahmin, I'll not become a human being."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When questioned thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your worship will become a deva?</p>

					<p class="f4">You reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No indeed, brahmin. I'll not become a deva.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When questioned thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then your worship will become a gandharva?</p>

					<p class="f4">You reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No indeed, brahmin, I'll not become a gandharva.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When questioned thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then your worship will become a yakkha?</p>

					<p class="f4">You reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No indeed, brahmin, not a yakkha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When questioned thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then your worship will become a human being?</p>

					<p class="f4">You reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No indeed, brahmin, I'll not become a human being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Who then, pray, will your worship become?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahmin, those āsavas whereby,<br/>
					if they were not abandoned,<br/>
					I should become a deva, -<br/>
					those āsavas in me are abandoned,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made non-existent,<br/>
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those āsavas whereby,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Just as, brahmin,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> a lotus,<br/>
					blue,<br/>
					red<br/>
					or white,<br/>

					having overcome the world,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
					I abide unsoiled by the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take it that I am a Buddha, brahmin.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span> The āsavas whereby would be<br/>

					      <p class="f4 in2">As a lotus, fair and lovely,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Loke,</i> given in the uddāna. See Introduction, p. vi.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>  In Kosala. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Brethr.</i> 67; <i>M.</i> i, 326. <i>Comy.</i> expl. the name of the former thus: 'built by torchlight <i>(ukkā).</i>' At the latter Kassapa Buddha was said to have been born.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>  This may be the brāhmin to whom the Buddha's bowl was given after his death, <i>D.</i> ii, 166. <i>Comy.</i> pictures him as a master of the three Vedas, journeying along with 500 youths and teaching them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> For the marks of the 'Superman' see Introd. to <i>Dial.</i> iii, 132 <i>ff.</i> (Lakkhana-sutta). They seem to have been a brahmin, not Buddhist, legend, or part of it, and point to a later period when the Buddha's quasi-divinity had become established. Of these footprints <i>Comy.</i> remarks: 'The Buddha's footprint, being <i>sukhumāni,</i> are invisible, but on this occasion he purposely allowed the impressions to be seen by the brahmin.' <i>Cf.</i> <i>The Life of Buddha,</i> by Dr. Thomas, p. 215 ff.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Pasādanīya.</i> At <i>Ud.</i> 7, <i>dassanīya.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> Text repeats <i>santindriyaṃ,</i> which should read <i>yatindriyaṃ</i> (<i>UdA.</i> 87). <i>Comy.</i> has <i>saṅyatindriyaṃ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>Nāga.</i> <i>Comy.</i> fancifully derives the word from <i>(puna) anāgacchati</i> and <i>na āguṃ karoti.</i></p>

						

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>Bhavissati.</i> This passage has hitherto been mistranslated. The brahmin does not ask 'Are you?' but uses the future tense common to the verbs be and become. The Buddha replies, not 'I am not (these things),' but 'shall not become,' also using the future. The gāthas clearly imply that he will not again 'become' any one of these creatures, having destroyed the basis of rebirth; nor do they hint at any supernatural or superhuman marks or appearance. Probably the sentence about the 'wheels,' as well as the last prose paragraph, is a later insertion, being an editorial attempt to lend the plausibility of later values to a fragmentary, half-forgotten 'saying.' We meet with apparently the same Doṇa, in the next Nipāta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Text wrongly <i>bhikkhave</i> for <i>brāhmaṇe</i>.</p>

						

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> St. John's Gospel, xvi, 33.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> Text should read <i>devūpapatty. Vihangamo</i> is described by <i>Comy.</i> as <i>ākāsa-caro gandhabba-kāyika-devo.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> Text here and at <i>MA.</i> i, 61, <i>abbaje</i> (optative of a supposed <i>abbajati,</i> 'would go'). <i>Pali Dict.</i> suggests <i>andaje</i> (but what case would this be and how would one translate?). I adopted this reading at <i>UdA.</i> 176, and in Mr. Jayasundara's trans. of <i>A.</i> ii, with <i>Sinh.</i> text. But now I propose to read <i>abbude</i> (the foetus). I took the gāthas wrongly. <i>Comy.</i> says nothing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> <i>Vinaḷīkatā = vigaia-naḷā, vigata-bandhanā katā.</i> <i>Comy.</i> and at <i>Sn.</i> 542, <i>vigata-naḷā, ucchinnā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> The brahmin's question is not unique. In another story also of this legendary type, the Sonananda Jātaka (J. v, 317), we read: 'Art devatā, gandharva or Sakka, giver to men? Art human of magic potency? As what may we know thee?'</p>
