					<p><span class="f2">[39]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>
					a man is incapable of falling away;<br/>
					he is near to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is perfect in virtue,<br/>
					he is guarded as to the doors of the sense faculties,<br/>
					he is moderate in eating,<br/>
					he is given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what way is a monk perfect in virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is virtuous,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					he dwells restrained with the restraint of the obligations:<br/>
					perfect in the practice of right conduct<br/>
					he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br/>
					he takes up and <span class="f2 g"><b>[46]</b></span> trains himself<br/>
					in the stages of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a monk is perfect in virtue.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk guarded<br/>
					as to the doors of the sense-faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> a monk,<br/>
					seeing an object with the eye,<br/>
					does not grasp at the general features<br/>
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might flow in upon one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of the eye uncontrolled,<br/>
					be applies himself to such control,<br/>
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the eye,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears a sound with the ear,<br/>
					does not grasp at the general features<br/>
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might flow in upon one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of the ear uncontrolled,<br/>
					be applies himself to such control,<br/>
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the ear,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he smells a scent with the nose,<br/>
					does not grasp at the general features<br/>
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might flow in upon one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of the nose uncontrolled,<br/>
					be applies himself to such control,<br/>
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the nose,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he tastes a savour with the tongue,<br/>
					does not grasp at the general features<br/>
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might flow in upon one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of the tongue uncontrolled,<br/>
					be applies himself to such control,<br/>
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the tongue,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he contacts tangibles with the body,<br/>
					does not grasp at the general features<br/>
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might flow in upon one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of the body uncontrolled,<br/>
					be applies himself to such control,<br/>
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the body,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">When with the mind he cognizes mental states<br/>
					does not grasp at the general features<br/>
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might flow in upon one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of the mind uncontrolled,<br/>
					be applies himself to such control,<br/>
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the mind,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk has the doors of the sense-faculties guarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk moderate in eating?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk takes his food<br/>
					thoughtfully and prudently,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					not for sport,<br/>
					not for indulgence,<br/>
					not for personal charm or adornment,<br/>
					but just enough for the support,<br/>
					for the continuance of body,<br/>
					for its resting unharmed,<br/>
					to help the living of the God-life,<br/>
					with this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My former feeling I check<br/>
					and I set going no new feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus maintenance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> shall be mine,<br/>
					blamelessness<br/>
					and comfort in life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a monk is moderate in eating.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk given to watchfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">By day a monk walks up and down<br/>
					and then sits,<br/>
					thus cleansing his heart<br/>
					of conditions that should be checked.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">By night for the first watch<br/>
					he walks up and down<br/>
					and then sits,<br/>
					thus cleansing his heart<br/>
					of conditions that should be checked.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night,<br/>
					lying on his right side<br/>
					he takes up the lion <span class="f2 g"><b>[47]</b></span> posture,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					resting one foot on the other,<br/>
					and thus collected and composed<br/>
					fixes his thoughts on rising up again.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In the last watch of the night,<br/>
					at early dawn,<br/>
					he walks up and down,<br/>
					then sits,<br/>
					and so cleanses his heart<br/>
					of conditions that should be checked.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk is given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br/>
					a monk is incapable of falling away:<br/>
					he is near to Nibbāna.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Stablished in virtue, faculty-controlled,<br/>
							Moderate in eating, given to watchfulness,<br/>
							Thus dwelling day and night unwearied,<br/>
							Making become good dhamma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> for to win<br/>
							Peace from the toil,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> in earnestness delighting,<br/>
							In slackness seeing danger, - such a monk<br/>
							Incapable of failure nears the Goal.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>
