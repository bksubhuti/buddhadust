					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk who has shaken off individual beliefs,<br/>
					who<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> has utterly given up quests,<br/>
					whose body-complex is calmed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk one who has shaken off individual beliefs?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, whatsoever individual beliefs generally prevail<br/>
					among the generality of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">The world is eternal or<br/>
					The world is not eternal:<br/>
					The world is finite or<br/>
					The world is infinite:<br/>
					What is life,<br/>
					that is <span class="f2 g"><b>[48]</b></span> body; or<br/>
					One thing is life,<br/>
					another thing is body;<br/>
					A Tathāgata is beyond death or<br/>
					A Tathāgata is not beyond death; or,<br/>
					He both is and is not; or,<br/>
					He neither is nor is not beyond death, -<br/>
					all these beliefs of his are given up,<br/>
					vomited up,<br/>
					dropped,<br/>
					abandoned,<br/>
					and renounced.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk has shaken off individual beliefs.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk one who has utterly given up quests?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the quest after sense-pleasure is abandoned by a monk,<br/>
					the quest after becoming is abandoned,<br/>
					the quest after the holy life has become allayed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk is one who has utterly given up quests.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk one whose body-complex is calmed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, by abandoning pleasure<br/>
					and abandoning pain,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the ease and discomfort which he had before,<br/>
					attains and abides in a state of neither pain nor pleasure,<br/>
					an equanimity of utter purity,<br/>
					which is the fourth musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk is one whose body-complex is calmed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk "withdrawn"?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the conceit of "I am" is abandoned in a monk,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made not to become again,<br/>
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk is withdrawn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a monk who has shaken off individual beliefs<br/>
					who has utterly given up quests,<br/>
					whose body-complex is calmed,<br/>
					is called "withdrawn."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The quests of sense, becoming, God-life -<br/>
							(These three) accumulations of wrong view<br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[49]</b></span> Become perversion of the truth. In him<br/>
							Who from all sensual lust is purified,<br/>
							Who by destroying craving is set free,<br/>
							Quests are renounced, wrong views are rooted out.<br/>
							That monk at peace, composed and tranquil-minded,<br/>
							Unconquered one, by comprehending pride<br/>
							Awakened one, - 'tis he is called "withdrawn."'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>
