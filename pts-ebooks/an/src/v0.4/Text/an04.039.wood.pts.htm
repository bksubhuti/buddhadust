					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahmin Ujjaya came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					the brahmin Ujjaya said this<br/>
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, does the worthy Gotama praise sacrifice?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'No, brahmin,<br/>
					I do not praise every sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet I would not withhold praise<br/>
					from every sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">In whatever sacrifice, brahmin,<br/>
					cows are slaughtered,<br/>
					goats and sheep are slaughtered,<br/>
					poultry and pigs are slaughtered<br/>
					and divers living creatures<br/>
					come to destruction, -<br/>
					such sacrifice, brahmin,<br/>
					which involves butchery<br/>
					I do not praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">To such a sacrifice, brahmin,<br/>
					involving butchery<br/>
					neither the worthy ones<br/>
					nor those who have entered on the worthy way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					draw near.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in whatever sacrifice, brahmin,<br/>
					cows are not slaughtered<br/>
					goats and sheep are not slaughtered,<br/>
					poultry and pigs are not slaughtered<br/>
					and divers living creatures<br/>
					come not to destruction,<br/>
					such sacrifice<br/>
					not involving butchery<br/>
					I do praise;<br/>
					such as, for instance,<br/>
					a long-established charity,<br/>
					an oblation for the welfare of the family.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, brahmin, the worthy ones,<br/>
					those who have entered on the worthy way,<br/>
					do draw near to such a sacrifice<br/>
					which involves not butchery.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[50]</b></span> The sacrifice of horse and human life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
							The throwing of the peg,<span class="f3"><sup>6</sup></span> the drinking-rite;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
							The house unbarred, with all their cruelty<br/>
							Have little fruit. Where goats and sheep and kine<br/>
							Of divers sorts are sacrificed, go not<br/>
							Those sages great who've travelled the right way.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
							But sacrifices free from cruelty<br/>
							Which men keep up for profit of the clan.<br/>
							Where goats and sheep and kine of divers sorts<br/>
							Are never sacrificed, - to such as these<br/>
							Go sages great who've travelled the right way.<br/>
							Such should the thoughtful celebrate: and great<br/>
							The fruit of such; profit they bring, not loss.<br/>
							Lavish the offering, devas therewith are pleased.'</p>

Our <i>Comy.</i>, which = <i>SnA.</i> 321, differs somewhat from <i>SA.</i> i, 145 <i>ff.,</i> where the primitive form of these sacrifices is explained as harmless before the time of the rajah Okkāka. The <i>assa-medha</i> was then <i>sassa-m.</i> (sacrifice for a good harvest); the <i>purisa-m.</i> was a general feed of six months' duration, <i>medha</i> being called <i>medhāvitā,</i> shrewdness (in social functions). The <i>sammā-pāsa</i> was then called 'a bond to bind men's hearts.' The word <i>vāja-peyya</i> was originally <i>vāca-peyya,</i> affability in address, calling a person 'dear' or 'uncle': it was in short <i>piya-vācā.</i> Such security prevailed that all kept open doors, unbolted <i>(niraggala).</i> These older phrases are called by <i>SA.</i> 'the four bases of sympathy'; <i>cf. supra,</i> § 2 and <i>AA.</i> on <i>A.</i> iv, 151. But, as said above, they had now degenerated into bloody sacrifices and orgies. The whole story of Okkāka and the brahmins will be found at <i>Sn.,</i> p. 50 (Brahmatia-dhammika-sutta).</p>
