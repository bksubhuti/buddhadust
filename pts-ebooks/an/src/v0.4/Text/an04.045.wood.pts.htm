					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[55]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Rohitassa, of the devas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					when the night was waning,<br/>
					came, <span class="f2 g"><b>[56]</b></span> lighting up all Jeta Grove<br/>
					with surpassing brilliance,<br/>
					to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and saluting him<br/>
					stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So standing<br/>
					Rohitassa of the devas said this<br/>
					to the Exalted One:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, is it possible for us,<br/>
					by going,<br/>
					to know,<br/>
					to see,<br/>
					to reach world's end,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					where there is no more being born<br/>
					or growing old,<br/>
					no more dying,<br/>
					no more falling (from one existence)<br/>
					and rising up (in another)"?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence, where there is no more being born<br/>
					or growing old,<br/>
					no more dying,<br/>
					no more falling from one existence<br/>
					and rising up in another, -<br/>
					I declare that that end of the world<br/>
					is not by going to be known,<br/>
					seen,<br/>
					or reached."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, lord,<br/>
					how well it is said by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Where there is no more being born<br/>
					or growing old,<br/>
					no more dying,<br/>
					no more falling from one existence<br/>
					and rising up in another, -<br/>
					I declare that that end of the world<br/>
					is not by going to be known,<br/>
					seen,<br/>
					or reached.'!</p>

					<p class="f4">Formerly, lord,<br/>
					I was the hermit<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> called Rohitassa,<br/>
					Bhoja's son,<br/>
					one of psychic power,<br/>
					a sky-walker.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Such, lord, was my speed, -<br/>
					just as if a stout bowman,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> for instance,<br/>
					a skilled archer,<br/>
					a practised hand,<br/>
					a trained man<br/>
					could with a light shaft<br/>
					shoot easily across a palm-tree's shadow, -<br/>
					such was my speed.</p>

					<p class="f4">The extent of my stride<br/>
					was as the distance between the eastern<br/>
					and the western ocean.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, lord, possessed of such speed<br/>
					and of such a stride,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					there came a longing thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will reach world's end<br/>
					by going.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, lord,<br/>
					not to speak of (the time spent over)<br/>
					food and <span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span> drink,<br/>
					eating,<br/>
					tasting<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>
					and calls of nature,<br/>
					not to speak of struggles<br/>
					to banish sleep and weariness,<br/>
					though my life-span was a hundred years,<br/>
					though I lived a hundred years,<br/>
					though I travelled a hundred years,<br/>
					yet I reached not world's end<br/>
					but died ere that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful indeed, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous it is, lord,<br/>
					how well it has been said by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your reverence,<br/>
					where there is no more being born<br/>
					or growing old,<br/>
					no more dying,<br/>
					no more falling from one existence<br/>
					and rising up in another, -<br/>
					I declare that that end of the world<br/>
					is not by going to be known,<br/>
					seen,<br/>
					or reached.'!</p>

					<p class="f4">"But,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> your reverence,<br/>
					I declare not<br/>
					that there is any making an end of Ill<br/>
					without reaching world's end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, your reverence,<br/>
					in this very fathom-long body,<br/>
					along with its perceptions and thoughts,<br/>
					I proclaim the world to be,<br/>
					likewise the origin of the world<br/>
					and the making of the world to end,<br/>
					likewise the practice going to the ending of the world.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Not to be reached by going is world's end.<br/>
							Yet there is no release for man from Ill<br/>
							Unless he reach world's end. Then let a man<br/>
							Become<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> world-knower, wise, world-ender,<br/>
							Let him be one who lives the God-life.<br/>
							Knowing the world's end by becoming calmed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>
							He longs not for this world or another.'</p>

Jotika the householder has it. Jaṭilaka the householder ... Ghosita ... Meṇḍaka has it. The five persons of great merit have it. ... The fourth jhāna is the original stage for its attainment.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> S. ii, 266; <i>M.</i> i, 82; <i>A.</i> iv, 429, for the simile. The text of <i>S.</i> i alone inserts <i>katayoggo</i> after <i>katahattho</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> This phrase is omitted by S. i and inserted in the next sentence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> Here our text repeats the previous phrase <i>Yattha kho ... vadāmi.</i> I follow the more likely reading of <i>S.</i> i, <i>Na kho pan'ahaṃ.</i> At <i>S.</i> iv, 93 the two declarations are made by the Buddha and the solution reached by Ānanda.
