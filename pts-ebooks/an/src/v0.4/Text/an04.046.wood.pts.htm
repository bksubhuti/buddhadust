					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when that night was spent<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span> 'Monks, this night Rohitassa of the devas,<br/>
					when night was waning,<br/>
					came to visit me,<br/>
					lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with surpassing brilliance,<br/>
					and on coming to me<br/>
					stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So standing<br/>
					Rohitassa of the devas said this to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, is it possible for us,<br/>
					by going,<br/>
					to know,<br/>
					to see,<br/>
					to reach world's end,<br/>
					where there is no more being born<br/>
					or growing old,<br/>
					no more dying,<br/>
					no more falling (from one existence)<br/>
					and rising up (in another)"?</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, monks, I said this<br/>
					to Rohitassa of the devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence, where there is no more being born<br/>
					or growing old,<br/>
					no more dying,<br/>
					no more falling from one existence<br/>
					and rising up in another, -<br/>
					I declare that that end of the world<br/>
					is not by going to be known,<br/>
					seen,<br/>
					or reached."</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereupon, monks, Rohitassa of the devas<br/>
					said this to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, lord,<br/>
					how well it is said by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Where there is no more being born<br/>
					or growing old,<br/>
					no more dying,<br/>
					no more falling from one existence<br/>
					and rising up in another, -<br/>
					I declare that that end of the world<br/>
					is not by going to be known,<br/>
					seen,<br/>
					or reached.'!</p>

					<p class="f4">Formerly, lord, I was the hermit called Rohitassa,<br/>
					Bhoja's son,<br/>
					one of psychic power,<br/>
					a sky-walker.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, lord, was my speed, -<br/>
					just as if a stout bowman,<br/>
					for instance,<br/>
					a skilled archer,<br/>
					a practised hand,<br/>
					a trained man<br/>
					could with a light shaft<br/>
					shoot easily across a palm-tree's shadow, -<br/>
					such was my speed.</p>

					<p class="f4">The extent of my stride<br/>
					was as the distance between the eastern<br/>
					and the western ocean.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, lord, possessed of such speed<br/>
					and of such a stride,<br/>
					there came a longing thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will reach world's end<br/>
					by going.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, lord, not to speak of (the time spent over)<br/>
					food and drink,<br/>
					eating,<br/>
					tasting<br/>
					and calls of nature,<br/>
					not to speak of struggles<br/>
					to banish sleep and weariness,<br/>
					though my life-span was a hundred years,<br/>
					though I lived a hundred years,<br/>
					though I travelled a hundred years,<br/>
					yet I reached not world's end<br/>
					but died ere that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful indeed, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous it is, lord,<br/>
					how well it has been said by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your reverence, where there is no more being born<br/>
					or growing old,<br/>
					no more dying,<br/>
					no more falling from one existence<br/>
					and rising up in another, -<br/>
					I declare that that end of the world<br/>
					is not by going to be known,<br/>
					seen,<br/>
					or reached.'!</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, monks,<br/>
					I said this to Rohitassa of the devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, your reverence,<br/>
					I declare not<br/>
					that there is any making an end of Ill<br/>
					without reaching world's end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, your reverence,<br/>
					in this very fathom-long body,<br/>
					along with its perceptions and thoughts,<br/>
					I proclaim the world to be,<br/>
					likewise the origin of the world<br/>
					and the making of the world to end,<br/>
					likewise the practice going to the ending of the world.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Not to be reached by going is world's end.<br/>
							Yet there is no release for man from Ill<br/>
							Unless he reach world's end. Then let a man<br/>
							Become world-knower, wise, world-ender,<br/>
							Let him be one who lives the God-life.<br/>
							Knowing the world's end by becoming calmed<br/>
							He longs not for this world or another.'</p>
