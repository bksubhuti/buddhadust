					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four stains<br/>
					of moon and sun,<br/>
					stained by which stains<br/>
					moon and sun burn not,<br/>
					shine not,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[62]</b></span> Cloud, monks, is a stain<br/>

					<p class="f4">Just so, monks, there are four stains<br/>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are some recluses and brahmins<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are some recluses and brahmins<br/>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the second stain<br/>

					stained by which stain<br/>
					some recluses and brahmins burn not,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are some recluses and brahmins<br/>
					who take<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> gold and silver,<br/>
					who abstain not from accepting<br/>
					gold and silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the third stain<br/>

					stained by which stain<br/>
					some recluses and brahmins burn not,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are some recluses and brahmins<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This sutta occurs at <i>Vin.</i> ii, 295.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> It is noticeable that monks are not mentioned. But probably 'recluses' includes them. At <i>S.</i> iv, 325 monks are called 'recluses who are Sakya-putta' in a charge of this sort made against them by laymen. For the effects of drink see <i>Expositor,</i> ii, 487; <i>Asl.</i> 380.</p>
