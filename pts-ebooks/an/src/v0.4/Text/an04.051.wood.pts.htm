					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four floods of merit,<br/>
					floods of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">To him, monks, who is the giver of the robe,<br/>
					using which<br/>
					a monk is able to attain and abide in unbounded concentration <span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span> of mind,<br/>
					to him comes a flood of merit,<br/>
					a flood of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him, monks, who is the giver of alms-food,<br/>
					using which<br/>
					a monk is able to attain and abide in unbounded concentration of mind,<br/>
					to him comes a flood of merit,<br/>
					a flood of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him, monks, who is the giver of lodging,<br/>
					using which<br/>
					a monk is able to attain and abide in unbounded concentration of mind,<br/>
					to him comes a flood of merit,<br/>
					a flood of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him, monks, who is the giver of requisites and medicines for use in sickness,<br/>
					using which<br/>
					a monk is able to attain and abide in unbounded concentration of mind,<br/>
					to him comes a flood of merit,<br/>
					a flood of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, if an Ariyan disciple be possessed of these four floods of merit,<br/>
					floods of things profitable,<br/>
					it is no easy thing to take the measure of his merit, (so as to say): -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such and such is the extent<br/>
					of the flood of merit,<br/>
					a flood of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>

					to profit<br/>
					and happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">nay, it is to be reckoned as an incalculable,<br/>
					immeasurable,<br/>
					mighty mass of merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, it is no easy thing to take the measure of the water<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> in the mighty ocean, (so as to say): -</p>

					<p class="f4">"So many gallons of water,<br/>
					so many hundred,<br/>
					so many thousand,<br/>
					so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water" -</p>

					<p class="f4">nay, it is to be reckoned as an incalculable,<br/>
					immeasurable,<br/>
					mighty mass of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks, if an Ariyan disciple be possessed of these four floods of merit,<br/>
					floods of things profitable,<br/>
					it is no easy thing to take the measure of his merit, (so as to say): -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such and such is the extent<br/>
					of the flood of merit,<br/>
					a flood of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>

					<p class="f4">nay, it is to be reckoned as an incalculable,<br/>
					immeasurable,<br/>
					mighty mass of merit.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">To boundless mighty ocean, mighty pool,<br/>
							Fearsome, the resting-place of divers gems,<br/>
							As rivers bearing multitudes of men<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
							Flow broadly down and to that ocean come;<br/>
							Just so to him that giveth food, drink, clothes,<br/>
							Who bed and seat and coverlet provides,<br/>
							Torrents of merit flood that mortal wise,<br/>
							As rivers, bearing water, reach the main.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
