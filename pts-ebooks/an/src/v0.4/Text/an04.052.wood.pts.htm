					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four floods of merit,<br/>
					floods of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br/>
					of unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in lore and conduct,<br/>
					Wellfarer,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					the trainer unsurpassed<br/>
					of men who can be trained,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the first flood of merit,<br/>
					flood of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br/>
					of unwavering loyalty to Dhamma, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is Dhamma,<br/>
					to be seen in this life,<br/>
					not a thing of time,<br/>
					(inviting to) come and see,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be understood by the wise,<br/>
					each for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the second flood of merit,<br/>
					flood of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br/>
					of unwavering loyalty to the Order of monks, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking the Way well<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking according to the Method,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of disciples:<br/>
					namely, the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight types<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the third flood of merit,<br/>
					flood of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br/>
					of the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>
					whole,<br/>
					unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise;<br/>
					virtues untainted,<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the fourth flood of merit,<br/>
					flood of things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, these are the four floods of merit, floods of <span class="f2 g"><b>[66]</b></span> things profitable,<br/>
					bringing happiness,<br/>
					giving the best things,<br/>
					whose fruit is happiness,<br/>
					leading to the heaven world,<br/>
					leading to what is dear,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and pleasant,<br/>
					to profit<br/>
					and happiness.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whoso hath faith in the Tathāgata<br/>
							Unwavering and firm, whose life is good,<br/>
							Praised by the Ariyans and dear to them;<br/>
							Whoso is likewise loyal to the Order<br/>
							And looks straight forth, - "He is not poor"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> they say,<br/>
							"Not (lived) in vain the life of such a man."<br/>
							So let the wise man cultivate (these four)<br/>
							Faith, virtue, piety and seeing Dhamma,<br/>
							Bearing the Buddha's message in his mind.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
