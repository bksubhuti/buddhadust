					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Bhagga near Crocodile Haunt,<br/>
					at Bhesakala Grove in Antelope park.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now in the forenoon the Exalted One robed himself,<br/>
					and taking outer robe and bowl<br/>
					set out for the dwelling of the housefather, Nakula's father.<br/>
					On coming there he sat down on a seat made ready.<br/>
					Then the housefather, Nakula's father,<br/>
					and the housewife, Nakula's mother,<br/>
					came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him and sat down at one side.<br/>
					So seated the housefather, Nakula's father,<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span> 'Lord, ever since the housewife, Nakula's mother,<br/>
					was brought home to me<br/>
					when a mere lad,<br/>
					she being then a mere girl,<br/>
					I am not conscious of having transgressed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> against her<br/>
					even in thought,<br/>
					much less in person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, we do desire to behold each other<br/>
					not only in this very life<br/>
					but also in the life to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then also the housewife, Nakula's mother,<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, ever since I,<br/>
					a mere girl,<br/>
					was led home to the housefather, Nakula's father,<br/>
					when he was a mere lad,<br/>
					I am not conscious of having transgressed against him<br/>
					even in thought,<br/>
					much less in person.<br/>
					Lord, we do desire to behold each other<br/>
					not only in this very life,<br/>
					but also in the life to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[Then said the Exalted One:] 'Herein, householders,<br/>
					if both wife and husband<br/>
					desire to behold each other<br/>
					both in this very life<br/>
					and in the life to come,<br/>
					and both are matched in faith,<br/>
					matched in virtue,<br/>
					matched in generosity,<br/>
					matched in wisdom,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					then do they behold each other<br/>
					in this very life<br/>
					and in the life to come.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"> If both, believers, self-controlled, well-spoken,<br/>
					Living as dhamma bids, use loving words<br/>
					One to the other, manifold the blessings<br/>
					That come to wife and husband, and to them<br/>
					The blessing of a pleasant life is born.<br/>
					Dejected are their foes, for both are good.<br/>
					So in this world, living as dhamma bids,<br/>
					The pair, in goodness matched, i' the deva-world<br/>
					Rejoicing win the bliss that they desire.'</p>
