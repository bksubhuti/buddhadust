					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein, monks,<br/>
					if both wife and husband<br/>
					desire to behold each other<br/>
					both in this very life<br/>
					and in the life to come,<br/>
					and both are matched in faith,<br/>
					matched in virtue,<br/>
					matched in generosity,<br/>
					matched in wisdom,<br/>
					then do they behold each other<br/>
					in this very life<br/>
					and in the life to come.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"> If both, believers, self-controlled, well-spoken,<br/>
					Living as dhamma bids, use loving words<br/>
					One to the other, manifold the blessings<br/>
					That come to wife and husband, and to them<br/>
					The blessing of a pleasant life is born.<br/>
					Dejected are their foes, for both are good.<br/>
					So in this world, living as dhamma bids,<br/>
					The pair, in goodness matched, i' the deva-world<br/>
					Rejoicing win the bliss that they desire.'</p>
