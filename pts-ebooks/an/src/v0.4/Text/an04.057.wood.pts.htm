					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Koliyans<br/>
					at a township of the Koliyans called Sajjanela.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One in the forenoon,<br/>
					robing himself<br/>
					and taking outer robe and bowl,<br/>
					approached the dwelling of Suppavasa of the Koliyans,<br/>
					and on reaching it<br/>
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Suppavasa of the Koliyans<br/>
					with her own hand<br/>
					satisfied and served the Exalted One<br/>
					with choice food,<br/>
					both hard and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">And seeing that<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the Exalted One had eaten his fill<br/>
					and had washed both hand and bowl,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					Suppavasa of the Koliyans sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As she sat thus<br/>
					the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to Suppavasa of the Koliyans:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppavasa,<br/>
					the Ariyan woman-disciple who gives food<br/>
					gives four things<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					to the receiver thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">She gives life,<br/>
					she gives beauty,<br/>
					she gives happiness,<br/>
					she gives strength.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, giving life<br/>
					she is a partaker of life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					be it as deva or human:<br/>
					giving beauty<br/>
					she is a partaker of beauty,<br/>
					be it as deva or human:<br/>
					giving happiness,<br/>
					she is a partaker of happiness,<br/>
					be it as deva or human:<br/>
					giving strength<br/>
					she is a partaker of strength,<br/>
					be it as deva or human.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Suppavasa,<br/>
					the Ariyan woman-disciple<br/>
					who gives food<br/>
					gives these four things<br/>
					to the receiver thereof.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If she give food well prepared, pure, choice, possessing flavour,<br/>
							She by her offering made to those who walk upright, <span class="f2 g"><b>[72]</b></span><br/>
							Who are well practised in the Way and lofty are,<br/>
							On merit heaping merit, hath great fruit, and she<br/>
							Is praised by that World-knower. They who bear in mind<br/>
							An offering such as this and gladsome<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> roam the world,<br/>
							By tearing up the weed of meanness, root and branch,<br/>
							Such are not blamed and come to reach the heaven-place.'</p>
