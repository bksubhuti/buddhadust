					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a supporter by giving food gives these four things to the receiver thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He gives life, beauty, happiness and strength.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, giving life<br/>
					he is a partaker of life,<br/>
					be it as deva or human:<br/>
					giving beauty<br/>
					he is a partaker of beauty,<br/>
					be it as deva or human:<br/>
					giving happiness,<br/>
					he is a partaker of happiness,<br/>
					be it as deva or human:<br/>
					giving strength<br/>
					he is a partaker of strength,<br/>
					be it as deva or human.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, monks,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					who gives food<br/>
					gives these four things<br/>
					to the receiver thereof.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">To those well trained, who live on others' alms,<br/>
							Whoso gives zealously in season due<br/>
							Their daily food, on them confers four things:<br/>
							Long life and beauty, happiness and strength.<br/>
							Who giveth life, strength, beauty, happiness,<br/>
							Hath long and honoured life, wherever born.'</p>
