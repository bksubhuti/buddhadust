					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>
					the Exalted One said this to the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

					<p class="f4">(The wish:) 'O may wealth<br/>

					<p class="f4">These, housefather,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather,<br/>
					to the winning of these four conditions<br/>

					four conditions conduce.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Perfection of faith,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, housefather, is perfection of faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein the Ariyan disciple is faithful, he has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata, thus:</p>

						

					<p class="f4">He it is, Exalted One, Arahant, perfectly enlightened, and so forth, a Buddha is the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is called "perfection of faith."</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is perfection of virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein the Ariyan disciple abstains from taking life,<br/>
					stealing,<br/>
					wrong-doing in sense-desires,<br/>
					lying,<br/>
					he is not given to the use of liquor<br/>
					fermented and distilled<br/>

					<p class="f4">And what is perfection of generosity?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein the Ariyan disciple lives at home<br/>
					with heart free from the taint of stinginess,<br/>
					he is open-handed,<br/>
					pure-handed,<br/>
					delighting in self-surrender,<br/>
					one to ask a favour of,<br/>
					one who <span class="f2 g"><b>[75]</b></span> delights in dispensing charitable gifts.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is perfection of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">House father, living with his heart overcome<br/>

					one does what he should not<br/>
					fails to do what he should;<br/>

					<p class="f4">Living with his heart overcome<br/>

					<p class="f4">Living with his heart overcome<br/>

					<p class="f4">Living with his heart overcome<br/>

					one does what he should not<br/>
					fails to do what he should;<br/>
					so doing,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Living with his heart overcome<br/>

					one does what he should not<br/>
					fails to do what he should;<br/>
					so doing,<br/>

					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, that Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					knowing coveting and wrong desire<br/>
					to be a depravity of the mind,<br/>
					casts out the mind's depravity<br/>
					of coveting and wrong desire;</p>

					<p class="f4">knowing malice<br/>

					<p class="f4">knowing sloth-and-torpor<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, in so far as the Ariyan disciple,<br/>

					casts out the mind's depravity<br/>
					of coveting and wrong desire;</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">These four conditions, housefather,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, that same Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br/>
					amassed by strength of arm,<br/>
					won by sweat,<br/>
					lawful and lawfully gotten,<br/>
					is the doer of four deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br/>
					amassed by strength of arm,<br/>
					won by sweat,<br/>
					lawful and lawfully gotten,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple makes himself happy and cheerful,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					he is a contriver of perfect happiness;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					and <span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span> makes his mother and father, his children and wife, his servants and workmen, his friends and comrades<br/>
					cheerful and happy,<br/>
					he is a contriver of perfect happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is the first opportunity<br/>
					seized by him,<br/>
					turned to merit<br/>
					and fittingly<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> made use of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, housefather,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br/>
					amassed by strength of arm,<br/>
					won by sweat,<br/>
					lawful and lawfully gotten, -<br/>
					with that wealth<br/>
					he makes himself secure<br/>
					against all misfortunes whatsoever,<br/>
					such as may happen by way of fire,<br/>
					water,<br/>
					the rajah,<br/>
					a robber,<br/>
					an ill-disposed person<br/>
					or an (expectant) heir.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes steps<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> for his defence,<br/>
					he makes himself secure.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is the second opportunity<br/>
					seized by him,<br/>
					turned to merit<br/>
					and fittingly made use of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, housefather,<br/>
					with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br/>
					amassed by strength of arm,<br/>
					won by sweat,<br/>
					lawful and lawfully gotten, -<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple is a maker<br/>
					of the fivefold offering,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> namely:<br/>
					to relatives,<br/>
					to guests,<br/>
					to departed petas,<br/>
					to the rajah<br/>
					and to the devata.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third opportunity<br/>
					seized by him,<br/>
					turned to merit<br/>
					and fittingly made use of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, housefather,<br/>
					with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br/>
					amassed by strength of arm,<br/>
					won by sweat,<br/>
					lawful and lawfully gotten,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple offers a gift<br/>
					to all such recluses and brahmins<br/>
					as abstain from sloth and negligence,<br/>
					who are bent on kindness and forbearance,<br/>
					who tame the one self,<br/>
					calm the one self,<br/>
					cool<span class="f3"><sup>12</sup></span> the one self,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					to such he offers a gift<br/>
					which has the highest results,<br/>
					a gift heavenly,<br/>
					resulting in happiness<br/>
					and leading to heaven.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This <span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span> is the fourth opportunity<br/>
					seized by him,<br/>
					turned to merit<br/>
					and fittingly made use of.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, housefather, this same Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br/>
					amassed by strength of arm,<br/>
					won by sweat,<br/>
					lawful and lawfully gotten,<br/>
					is a doer of these four deeds of merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the wealth of anyone<br/>
					be spent<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> without these four deeds of merit,<br/>
					such wealth is called<br/>
					"wealth that has failed<br/>
					to seize its opportunity,<br/>
					failed to win merit,<br/>
					unfittingly<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> made use of.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, housefather, if the wealth of anyone<br/>
					be spent on these four deeds of merit,<br/>
					then it is called<br/>
					"wealth that has seized its opportunity,<br/>
					turned to merit,<br/>
					and is fittingly made use of."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I have enjoyed my wealth. Those serving me<br/>
							And those dependent on me have escaped<br/>
							From dangers. I have made the best of gifts,<br/>
							Nay, done the oblations five. The virtuous,<br/>
							Composed, who live the good life, I've supported.<br/>
							That aim<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span> the which to win householders wise<br/>
							Should long for wealth, I've won. I've done a deed<br/>
							Never to be regretted, - pondering thus<br/>
							A mortal man in Ariyan dhamma firm<br/>
							Is praised in this world, then in heaven rejoices.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span></p>
