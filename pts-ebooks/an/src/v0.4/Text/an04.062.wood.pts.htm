					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>
					the Exalted One said this to the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

					<p class="f4">'House father, there are these four kinds of bliss<br/>
					to be won by the householder<br/>
					who enjoys the pleasures of sense<br/>
					from time to time<br/>
					and when occasion offers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The bliss of ownership,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					the bliss of wealth,<br/>
					the bliss of doubtlessness,<br/>
					the bliss of blamelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, housefather, is the bliss of ownership?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span> In this case a clansman has wealth<br/>
					acquired by energetic striving,<br/>
					amassed by strength of arm,<br/>
					won by sweat,<br/>
					lawful<br/>
					and lawfully gotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wealth is mine<br/>
					acquired by energetic striving,<br/>
					amassed by strength of arm,<br/>
					won by sweat,<br/>
					lawful<br/>
					and lawfully gotten,<br/>
					bliss comes to him,<br/>
					satisfaction comes to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is called<br/>
					"the bliss of ownership."</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the bliss of wealth?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, housefather,<br/>
					a clansman by means of wealth<br/>
					acquired by energetic striving,<br/>
					amassed by strength of arm,<br/>
					won by sweat,<br/>
					lawful<br/>
					and lawfully gotten,<br/>
					both enjoys his wealth<br/>
					and does meritorious deeds therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of wealth<br/>
					acquired by energetic striving,<br/>
					amassed by strength of arm,<br/>

					lawful<br/>

					I both enjoy my wealth<br/>
					and do meritorious deeds,<br/>
					bliss comes to him,<br/>
					satisfaction comes to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is called<br/>
					"the bliss of wealth."</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the bliss of doubtlessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a clansman<br/>
					owes no debt<br/>
					great or small<br/>
					to anyone.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">I owe no debt,<br/>
					great or small,<br/>
					to anyone,<br/>
					bliss comes to him,<br/>
					satisfaction comes to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is called<br/>
					"the bliss of doubtlessness."</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the bliss of blamelessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, housefather,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/>
					with blameless action of body,<br/>
					blameless action of speech,<br/>
					blameless action of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">I am blessed<br/>
					with blameless action of body,<br/>
					with blameless action of speech<br/>
					with blameless action of mind,<br/>
					bliss comes to him,<br/>
					satisfaction comes to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					"the bliss of blamelessness."</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, housefather, are the four kinds of bliss<br/>
					to be won by the householder<br/>
					who enjoys the pleasures of sense<br/>
					from time to time<br/>
					when occasion offers.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Winning the bliss of doubtlessness a man<br/>
							May then recall the bliss of really having.<br/>
							When he enjoys the bliss of wealth, he sees<br/>
							'Tis such<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> by wisdom. When he sees he knows.<br/>
							Thus is he wise indeed in both respects.<br/>
							But these have not one-sixteenth of the bliss<br/>
