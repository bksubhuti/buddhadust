					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, those families where mother and father<br/>
					are worshipped in the home<br/>
					are reckoned like unto Brahma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those families where mother and father<br/>
					are worshipped in the home<br/>
					are ranked with teachers of old.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those families where mother and father are worshipped in the home<br/>
					are ranked with the devas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of old.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of offerings, monks, are those families<br/>
					where mother and father are worshipped in the home.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahma," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Teachers of old," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Devas of old," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Worthy of offerings," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because mother and father do much for children,<br/>
					they bring them up,<br/>
					nourish<br/>
					and introduce them to the world.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Parents are "Brahma" called, "teachers of old,"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
							Worthy of gifts are they, compassionate<br/>
							Unto their tribe of children. Thus the wise<br/>
							Should worship them and pay them honours due.<br/>
							Serve them with food and drink, clothing and bed.<br/>
							Anoint their bodies, bathe and wash their feet.<br/>
							For service such as this to parents given<br/>
							In this life sages praise a man, and he<br/>
							Hereafter has reward of joy in heaven.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> i, 132 = <i>G.S.</i> i, 114; <i>Itv.,</i> p. 109 The similar Upanishadic context, Taittirīya 1, 11, 1 (misprinted in <i>G.S.</i> i as ii) runs as follows:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">One should not be negligent of duties to devas and fathers:</p>

					      <p class="in2">Become one to whom mother is as deva.<br/>
							Become one to whom father is as deva;</p>

					<p class="lgqt">and so for 'teacher' and for 'guest.' <i>Cf.</i> also <i>Jāt.</i> No. 532.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>A.</i> i omits this sentence. <i>Pubbadevā,</i> like <i>pubbapetā,</i> would seem to mean those who have lived on earth (ancestors) and are now worshipped as pitris, whereas petas are still earth-bound. But it may refer to the ancient Vedic gods. Texts have <i>sapubbadevatāni,</i> but <i>Comy.</i> -<i>devakāni.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Dassetāro.</i> <i>Comy.</i> takes this term to mean 'point out objects desirable and undesirable.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> The <i>gāthas</i> are a continuation of those of sutta 32, and the whole poem is at <i>JA.</i> v, 330 (Sona-Nanda-Jātaka).</p>
