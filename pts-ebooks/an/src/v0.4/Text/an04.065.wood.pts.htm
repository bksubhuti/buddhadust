					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who measures according to (outward) form and is satisfied therewith;<br/>
					he who measures according to (others') words and is satisfied therewith;<br/>
					he who measures according to austerity and is satisfied therewith;<br/>
					he who measures according to dhamma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> and is satisfied therewith.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If they have measured by the form and go by what folk say,<br/>
							Desire-and-passion-led, they do not know that man.<br/>
							If the very man he know not, nor things external see,<br/>
							Hedged in on every side that fool by words is swayed.<br/>
							If the very man he know not, but things external see,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
							The outward fruits observing, he too by words is swayed.<br/>
							But if he know the very man and see externals too,<br/>
							Clear-sighted without hindrance,<span class="f3"><sup>4</sup></span> by words he is not swayed.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Here <i>Sinh.</i> text wrongly reads <i>na passati.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> These <i>gāthas</i> occur, with slight differences, at <i>Thag.</i> 469; <i>Brethr.</i> 230, where they are ascribed to Bhaddiya the Dwarf, the sweet-voiced teacher, and are there more fittingly applied. He says: 'People see my misshapen <i>rūpa,</i> and misjudge me; but on hearing my voice <i>(ghosa)</i> they are entranced. It looks as if our version is derived from those at <i>Thag.,</i> for in the former there is no reference to austerity or dhamma.</p>
