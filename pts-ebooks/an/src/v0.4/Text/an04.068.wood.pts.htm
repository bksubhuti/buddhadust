					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, on the hill Vultures' Peak,<br/>
					not long after Devadatta had left (the Order).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks thus concerning Devadatta:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

						

					<p class="f4">"To the ruin of self, monks,<br/>
					did (love of) gains, favours and flattery<br/>
					come upon Devadatta;<br/>
					to the misfortune of others, monks,<br/>
					did (love of) gains, favours and flattery<br/>
					come upon Devadatta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, the plantain gives fruit<br/>
					to the ruin of self,<br/>
					gives fruit<br/>
					to the misfortune of others, so,<br/>
					did love of gains, favours and flattery<br/>
					to the ruin of self,<br/>
					come upon Devadatta;<br/>
					to the misfortune of others, monks,<br/>
					did love of gains, favours and flattery<br/>
					come upon Devadatta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, a bamboo gives fruit<br/>
					to the ruin of self,<br/>
					gives fruit<br/>
					to the misfortune of others, so,<br/>
					did love of gains, favours and flattery<br/>
					to the ruin of self,<br/>
					come upon Devadatta;<br/>
					to the misfortune of others, monks,<br/>
					did love of gains, favours and flattery<br/>
					come upon Devadatta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, a reed gives fruit<br/>
					to the ruin of self,<br/>
					gives fruit<br/>
					to the misfortune of others, so,<br/>
					did love of gains, favours and flattery<br/>
					to the ruin of self,<br/>
					come upon Devadatta;<br/>
					to the misfortune of others, monks,<br/>
					did love of gains, favours and flattery<br/>
					come upon Devadatta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a mule conceives<br/>
					to her own ruin,<br/>
					to the misfortune of others, even so, monks,<br/>
					did love of gains, favours and flattery<br/>
					to the ruin of self,<br/>
					come upon Devadatta;<br/>
					to the misfortune of others, monks,<br/>
					did love of gains, favours and flattery<br/>
					come upon Devadatta.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Truly its fruit the plantain doth destroy,<br/>
							Their fruit destroys the bamboo and the rush;<br/>
							So homage doth destroy the fool,<br/>
							Just as its embryo the mule.'</p>
