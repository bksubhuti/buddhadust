					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four efforts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The effort to restrain,<br/>
					that to abandon,<br/>
					that to make-become,<br/>
					and the effort to preserve.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the effort to restrain?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk generates desire<br/>
					for the non-arising of evil,<br/>
					unprofitable states<br/>
					that have not yet arisen;<br/>
					he makes an effort,<br/>
					sets going energy,<br/>
					he lays hold of<br/>
					and exerts his mind (to this end).</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					"the effort to restrain."</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the effort to abandon?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk generates desire<br/>
					for the abandoning of evil,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[84]</b></span> unprofitable states<br/>
					that have arisen;<br/>
					he makes an effort,<br/>
					sets going energy,<br/>
					he lays hold of<br/>
					and exerts his mind (to this end).</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					"the effort to abandon."</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the effort to make-become?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein he generates desire<br/>
					for the arising of profitable states<br/>
					not yet arisen;<br/>
					he makes an effort,<br/>
					sets going energy,<br/>
					he lays hold of<br/>
					and exerts his mind (to this end).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					"the effort to make-become."</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the effort to preserve?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk generates desire<br/>
					for the establishing,<br/>
					for the non-confusion,<br/>
					for the more-becoming,<br/>
					for the increase,<br/>
					cultivation<br/>
					and fulfilment<br/>
					of profitable states that have arisen;<br/>
					he makes an effort,<br/>
					sets going energy,<br/>
					he lays hold of<br/>
					and exerts his mind (to this end).</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called "the effort to preserve."</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four efforts.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Restraint, leaving, making-become, preserving -<br/>
							These are the four exertions taught by him,<br/>
							The Kinsman of the Sun. Herein a monk<br/>
							Ardently striving makes an end of Ill.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>
