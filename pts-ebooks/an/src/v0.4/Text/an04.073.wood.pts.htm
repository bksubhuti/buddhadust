					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four things<br/>
					a man is to be understood<br/>
					as being unworthy.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the unworthy man,<br/>
					even unasked,<br/>
					speaks out what is discreditable to another.</p>

					<p class="f4">What then (would he say) if asked?</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, he is obliged to speak<br/>
					on being questioned,<br/>
					then without reserve or equivocation<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					he utters dispraise of another<br/>
					to the full and in all details.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is to be understood<br/>
					as the meaning of the saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This worthy<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> is an unworthy one."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, the unworthy one,<br/>
					even when asked,<br/>
					does not speak out<br/>
					what is to another's credit;<br/>
					much less when unasked.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, he is obliged to speak<br/>
					on being questioned,<br/>
					then with reserve and equivocation<br/>
					he utters praise of another<br/>
					grudgingly and in brief.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is to be understood<br/>
					as the meaning of the saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This worthy is an unworthy one."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"> <span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span>Again, monks, the unworthy one,<br/>
					even when asked<br/>

					<p class="f4">"This worthy is an Unworthy one."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, monks, the unworthy one,<br/>
					even unasked,<br/>
					speaks out what is creditable to himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">What then does he do when asked?</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, he is obliged to speak<br/>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is to be understood<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, possessed of four things one is to be understood as a worthy one.</p>
