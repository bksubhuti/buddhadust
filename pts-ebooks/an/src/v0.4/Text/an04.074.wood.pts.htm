					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, monks,<br/>
					when a young wife<br/>
					is first led home (to her husband)<br/>
					either by day or night,<br/>
					she at first feels exceeding great fear and bashfulness<br/>
					in the presence of her mother-in-law,<br/>
					her father-in-law,<br/>
					her husband,<br/>
					and even towards servants and work-people;<br/>
					but as time goes on,<br/>
					owing to living together and intimacy,<br/>
					she addresses mother-in-law,<br/>
					father-in-law<br/>
					and husband thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Away with you! What do you know?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in like manner, monks,<br/>
					a certain monk here maybe,<br/>
					when he first goes forth,<br/>
					whether by day or night,<br/>
					from the home to the homeless life,<br/>
					feels exceeding great fear and bashfulness<br/>
					in the presence of monks and nuns,<br/>
					disciples male <span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span> and female<br/>
					even of novices who serve in the monastery,<br/>
					but as time goes on,<br/>
					owing to living together and intimacy,<br/>
					he addresses teacher<br/>
					and preceptor thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Away with you! What do you know?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will dwell in mind<br/>
					like a young wife newly arrived.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how ye must train yourselves.'</p>
