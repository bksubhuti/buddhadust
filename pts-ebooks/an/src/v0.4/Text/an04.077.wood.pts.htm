					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four unthinkables,<br/>
					not to be thought of,<br/>
					thinking of which<br/>
					one would be distraught<br/>
					and come to grief.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of Buddhas, monks,<br/>
					the range is unthinkable,<br/>
					not to be thought of<br/>
					thinking of which<br/>
					one would be distraught<br/>
					and come to grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of one who is musing, monks,<br/>
					the range is unthinkable,<br/>
					not to be thought of<br/>
					thinking of which<br/>
					one would be distraught<br/>
					and come to grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fruit of action, monks,<br/>
					the range is unthinkable,<br/>
					not to be thought of<br/>
					thinking of which<br/>
					one would be distraught<br/>
					and come to grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">World-speculation,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> monks,<br/>
					the range is unthinkable,<br/>
					not to be thought of<br/>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four unthinkables,<br/>
					not to be thought of<br/>
					thinking of which<br/>
					one would be distraught<br/>
					and come to grief.</p>
