					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta came to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why such and such a trade<br/>
					practised<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> by some person<br/>
					turns out a failure?</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why such and such a trade<br/>
					practised by some person<br/>
					does not turn out as he intended?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, what is the reason<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why such and such a trade<br/>
					practised by some person<br/>
					does turn out as he intended?</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, what is the reason<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why such and such a trade<br/>
					practised by some person<br/>
					person prospers beyond<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> his intention?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this matter, Sāriputta,<br/>
					(suppose) someone comes to a recluse or brahmin<br/>
					and makes him an offer,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, say what you want<br/>
					by way of support."</p>

					<p class="f4">But he does not give him what he offered.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this man deceases from that life<br/>
					and returns to this sort of life,<br/>
					whatever trade he may practise,<br/>
					it turns out a failure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again in this matter, Sāriputta,<br/>
					suppose someone comes to a recluse or brahmin<br/>
					and makes him an offer, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, say what you want<br/>
					by way of support."</p>

					<p class="f4">But he does not give him<br/>
					what he intended to give.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, if this man deceases <span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span> from that life<br/>
					and returns to this sort of life,<br/>
					whatever trade he may practise,<br/>
					it does not turn out as he intended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Sāriputta,<br/>
					suppose someone comes to a recluse or brahmin<br/>
					and makes him an offer, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, say what you want<br/>
					by way of support."</p>

					<p class="f4">And gives him what he intended to give.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, if this man deceases from that life<br/>
					and returns to this sort of life,<br/>
					whatever trade he may practise,<br/>
					turns out as he intended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, Sāriputta,<br/>
					suppose someone comes to a recluse or brahmin<br/>
					and makes him a similar offer, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, say what you want<br/>
					by way of support."</p>

					<p class="f4">And gives him more than he intended to give.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if this man deceases from that life<br/>
					and returns to this sort of life,<br/>
					whatever trade he may practise,<br/>
					it prospers beyond his intention.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Sāriputta, is the reason,<br/>
					this is the cause<br/>
					why such and such a trade<br/>
					practised by some person<br/>
					turns out a failure.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Sāriputta, is the reason,<br/>
					this is the cause<br/>
					why such and such a trade<br/>
					practised by some person<br/>

					<p class="f4">This, Sāriputta, is the reason,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This, Sāriputta, is the reason,<br/>
