					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī<br/>
					in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said this<br/>
					to the Exalted One:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, lord, what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why womenfolk neither sit in a court (of justice),<br/>
					nor embark on business,<br/>
					nor reach the essence of the deed?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Womenfolk are uncontrolled, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Womenfolk are envious, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Womenfolk are greedy, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Womenfolk are weak in wisdom, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the reason,<br/>
					that is the cause<br/>
					why womenfolk do not sit in a court of justice,<br/>
					do not embark on business,<br/>
					do not reach the essence of the deed."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="demi"/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Ānanda is often found interested in women. But cf. <i>K.S.</i> iv, 165 ff.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Text <i>kamm'ojaṃ</i> (so also MSS. Adyar), the only instance of the word I have found; but <i>Sinn.</i> text and <i>Comy.</i> <i>Kambojaṃ</i> (?), the country in N.W. India next to Afghanistan. I follow our text's reading as there seems no reason for thus naming this country as a goal for woman's ambition. At <i>JA.</i> vi, 208 [Jāt 543] its natives are accounted barbarians. It may, however, have been on one of the great caravan routes. <i>Comy.</i> adds 'in search of wealth.' <i>Cf. Dhamm'oja,</i> 'essence of dhamma.' I think my rendering (pith of the matter) suits better with the fourth quality, <i>duppañño,</i> given for their shortcomings. (<i>Oja</i> is generally named in the series of <i>dhātuyo; vaṇṇa, gandha, rasa, oja.</i>) It is named as something extra - <i>e.g.,</i> as when devas put <i>oja</i> into the milk-rice of Sujātā or the truffles of Cunda, etc. (<i>cf.</i> <i>SnA.</i> ii, 154) - whereas certain yakkhas called <i>ojohārā</i> take it away.</p>
