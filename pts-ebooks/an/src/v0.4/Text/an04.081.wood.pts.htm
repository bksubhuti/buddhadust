					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>
					one is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes life,<br/>
					steals,<br/>
					is a wrong-doer in things sensual,<br/>
					a liar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br/>
					one is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>
					one is put into heaven<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from taking life,<br/>
					from stealing,<br/>
					from wrongdoing in things sensual,<br/>
					and from lying.</p>
