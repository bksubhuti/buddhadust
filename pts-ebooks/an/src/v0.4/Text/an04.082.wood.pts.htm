					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>
					one is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a liar,<br/>
					he is a malicious speaker,<br/>
					he is of harsh speech,<br/>
					he is an idle babbler.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br/>
					one is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>
					one is put into heaven<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from telling lies,<br/>
					he abstains from malicious speech,<br/>
					he abstains from harsh speech,<br/>
					he abstains from idle babble.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of four qualities<br/>
					one is put into heaven<br/>
					according to his deserts."</p>
