					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>
					one is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Without test or scrutiny<br/>
					he speaks in praise<br/>
					of what deserves not praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without test or scrutiny<br/>
					he speaks in blame<br/>
					of things deserving praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without test or scrutiny<br/>
					he shows appreciation<br/>
					where there should be none.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without test or scrutiny<br/>
					where appreciation should be shown,<br/>
					he shows displeasure.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
