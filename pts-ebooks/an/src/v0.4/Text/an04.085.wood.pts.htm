					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who is in darkness<br/>
					and bound for darkness;<br/>
					he who is in darkness<br/>
					but bound for light;<br/>
					he who is in light<br/>
					but bound for darkness;<br/>
					he who is in light<br/>
					and bound for light.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>
					in darkness<br/>
					bound for darkness?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is born in a low family,<br/>
					the family of a scavenger<br/>
					or a hunter<br/>
					or a basket-weaver<br/>
					or wheelwright<br/>
					or sweeper,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					or in the family of some wretched man<br/>
					hard put to it<br/>
					to find a meal<br/>
					or earn a living,<br/>
					where food and clothes<br/>
					are hard to get.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, he is ill-favoured,<br/>
					ugly,<br/>
					dwarfish,<br/>
					sickly,<br/>
					purblind,<br/>
					crooked,<br/>
					lame<br/>
					or paralysed,<br/>
					with never a bite or sup,<br/>
					without clothes,<br/>
					vehicle,<br/>
					without perfumes<br/>

					<p class="f4">He lives in the practice of evil<br/>

					in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, is the person<br/>

					<p class="f4">And that man is well-built,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He is one able to get clothes,<br/>
