					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The unshaken recluse,<br/>
					the blue-lotus recluse,<br/>
					the white-lotus recluse,<br/>
					and the recluse who is exquisite among recluses.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person an unshaken recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is one of<br/>
					right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right way of living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right concentration,</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is an unshaken recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a blue-lotus recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is one of right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right way of living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness<br/>
					right concentration<br/>
					right knowledge,<br/>
					right release..</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet does he not abide<br/>
					experiencing with his own person<br/>
					the eight deliverances.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is a blue-lotus recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a white-lotus recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is one of right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right way of living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness<br/>
					right concentration<br/>
					right knowledge<br/>
					right release,<br/>
					and he abides experiencing with his own person<br/>
					the eight deliverances.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is a white-lotus recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a person a recluse exquisite among recluses?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk when invited<br/>
					enjoys a plentiful supply of robes,<br/>
					but he gets little if uninvited;<br/>
					when invited<br/>
					enjoys a plentiful supply of alms-food and lodging;<br/>
					but he gets little if uninvited;<br/>
					when invited<br/>
					he enjoys a plentiful supply of requisites<br/>
					and medicines for use in sickness,<br/>
					but he gets little if uninvited.</p>

					<p class="f4">With whatsoever fellows in the holy life he dwells,<br/>
					their behaviour (towards him)<br/>
					in action of body, speech and thought<br/>
					is generally pleasing,<br/>
					rarely displeasing;<br/>
					moreover their presents to him<br/>
					are generally pleasing,<br/>
					rarely displeasing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, as to those afflictions<br/>
					which originate from bile,<br/>
					phlegm,<br/>
					wind,<br/>
					from the union of bodily humours,<br/>
					from changes of seasons,<br/>
					from stress of circumstances,<br/>
					from personal assaults,<br/>
					or from the ripeness of one's karma, -<br/>
					such do not trouble him much.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is free from sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to the four musings<br/>
					which belong to the higher thought<br/>
					and lead to happy living<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					he is a winner of them at will,<br/>
					without difficulty<br/>
					and without trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">By destroying the āsavas<br/>
					he reaches the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by wisdom,<br/>
					himself comprehending it<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, is a person<br/>
					a recluse exquisite among recluses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now monks, if rightly speaking<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[100]</b></span> one would speak about the recluse exquisite among recluses,<br/>
					it is just of me that he would rightly use the words.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>
