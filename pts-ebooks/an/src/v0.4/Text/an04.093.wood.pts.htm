					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br/>
					is one who gains mental calm of the self,<br/>
					but does not gain the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, a certain person<br/>
					is one who gains the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things<br/>
					but does not gain mental calm of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, a certain person<br/>
					is one who gains neither mental calm of the self,<br/>
					nor the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again a certain person<br/>
					is one who gains mental calm of the self,<br/>
					and the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four persons are found existing in the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, he who gained<br/>
					mental calm in himself,<br/>
					but not the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things,<br/>
					should make an effort to establish<br/>
					mental calm in himself,<br/>
					and attain the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at some future time<br/>
					he is one who has gained<br/>
					mental calm of the self,<br/>
					and the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, he who has gained<br/>
					the higher wisdom of insight into things,<br/>
					but not mental calm in himself,<br/>
					should make an effort to establish<br/>
					the higher wisdom of insight into things,<br/>
					and attain mental calm in himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at some future time<br/>
					he is one who has gained<br/>
					mental calm of the self,<br/>
					and the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, he who has gained<br/>
					neither mental calm in himself<br/>
					nor the higher wisdom of insight into things<br/>
					should put forth intense desire,<br/>
					effort,<br/>
					exertion,<br/>
					impulse,<br/>
					unobstruction,<br/>
					mindfulness<br/>
					and attention<br/>
					for the attainment of mental calm of the self,<br/>
					and the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, when one's turban or head is ablaze,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					for the extinguishing thereof<br/>
					one must put forth intense desire,<br/>
					effort,<br/>
					exertion,<br/>
					impulse,<br/>
					unobstruction,<br/>
					mindfulness<br/>
					and attention,<br/>
					even so must that person<br/>
					put forth intense,<br/>
					effort,<br/>
					exertion,<br/>
					impulse,<br/>
					unobstruction,<br/>
					mindfulness<br/>
					and attention,<br/>
					for the attainment of mental calm of the self,<br/>
					and the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at some future time<br/>
					he is one who has gained<br/>
					mental calm of the self,<br/>
					and the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, monks, he who has gained both<br/>
					mental calm of the self,<br/>
					and the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things<br/>
					should make an effort to establish just those profitable states<br/>
					and further to destroy the āsavas.</p>
