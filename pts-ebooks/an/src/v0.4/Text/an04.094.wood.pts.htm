					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br/>
					is one who gains mental calm of the self,<br/>
					but does not gain the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span> Herein again, monks, a certain person<br/>
					is one who gains the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things<br/>
					but does not gain mental calm of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, a certain person<br/>
					is one who gains neither mental calm of the self,<br/>
					nor the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again a certain person<br/>
					is one who gains mental calm of the self,<br/>
					and the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four persons are found existing in the world.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, this person<br/>
					who has gained mental calm in himself,<br/>
					but not the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things,<br/>
					might approach one who has the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into thing<br/>
					and address him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, your reverence,<br/>
					how are the activities to be regarded?</p>

					<p class="f4">How are the activities to be understood?</p>

					<p class="f4">How are the activities to be seen into?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the other expounds to him<br/>
					according as he himself<br/>
					has seen and known:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus and thus, your reverence,<br/>
					should the activities be regarded,<br/>
					thus should the activities be understood,<br/>
					thus should the activities be seen into."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at some later time<br/>
					he is one who has gained<br/>
					mental calm of the self,<br/>
					and the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, this person<br/>
					who has gained the higher wisdom<br/>
					of insight into things,<br/>
					but not mental calm in himself,<br/>
					might approach one who has mental calm in himself,<br/>
					and address him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, your reverence,<br/>
					how should the mind be steadied?</p>

					<p class="f4">How should the mind<br/>
					be made to settle down?</p>

					<p class="f4">How should the mind<br/>
					be made one-pointed?</p>

					<p class="f4">How should the mind<br/>
					be concentrated?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that other expounds to him<br/>
					according as he himself has seen and known:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus and thus, your reverence,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, he who has gained<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, your reverence, how should the mind<br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[104]</b></span> Then, monks, this person who has gained both<br/>
