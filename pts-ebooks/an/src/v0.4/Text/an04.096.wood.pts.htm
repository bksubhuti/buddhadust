					<p class="f4">Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who is bent, on his own profit,<br/>
					not another's;<br/>
					he who is bent on another's profit,<br/>
					not his own;<br/>
					he who is bent on the profit of neither;<br/>
					he who is bent on the profit of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent on his own profit,<br/>
					not another's?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is bent on the restraint of lust in self,<br/>
					but does not incite another to the restraint of lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is bent on the restraint of hatred in self,<br/>
					but does net incite another to the restraint of hatred.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is bent on the restraint of delusion in self,<br/>
					but does not incite another to the restraint of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is bent on his own profit, not on another's.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent on another's profit,<br/>
					not on his own?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person who is not bent on the restraint of lust in self,<br/>
					incites another to the restraint of lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person who is not bent on the restraint of hatred in self,<br/>
					incites another to the restraint of hatred.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person who is not bent on the restraint of delusion in self,<br/>
					incites another to the restraint of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is bent on another's profit,<br/>
					not on his own.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent neither on his own nor on another's profit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is not bent on the restraint of lust in self,<br/>
					nor does he incite another to the restraint of lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is not bent on the restraint of hatred in self,<br/>
					nor does he incite another to the restraint of hatred.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is not bent on the restraint of delusion in self,<br/>
					nor does he incite another to the restraint of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is bent neither on his own nor on another's profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent on the profit both of self and another?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a person is both bent on the restraint of lust in self,<br/>
					and incites another to the restraint of lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a person is both bent on the restraint of hatred in self,<br/>
					and incites another to the restraint of hatred.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a person is both bent on the restraint of delusion in self in self,<br/>
					and incites another to the restraint of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is bent on the profit both of self and another</p>

					<p class="f4">So these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>
