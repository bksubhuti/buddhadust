					<p class="f4">Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who is bent, on his own profit,<br/>
					not another's;<br/>
					he who is bent on another's profit,<br/>
					not his own;<br/>
					he who is bent on the profit of neither;<br/>
					he who is bent on the profit of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And how, monks, is a person bent on the profit of self,<br/>
					not of another?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is quick to observe<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					in teachings that are profitable,<br/>
					has naturally a good memory<br/>
					for teachings he has heard,<br/>
					examines the meaning of teachings he has learned by heart,<br/>
					and by understanding both the meaning and the letter thereof,<br/>
					walks in accordance with Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet is he not possessed of a charming voice or delivery,<br/>
					not possessed of urbane speech,<br/>
					distinctly and clearly enunciated,<br/>
					so as to make his meaning clear.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is he one to teach,<br/>
					urge,<br/>
					incite<br/>
					and gladden his fellows in the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is bent on the profit of self,<br/>
					not of another.</p>
