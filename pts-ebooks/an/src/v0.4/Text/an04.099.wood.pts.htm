					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who is bent, on his own profit,<br/>
					not another's;<br/>
					he who is bent on another's profit,<br/>
					not his own;<br/>
					he who is bent on the profit of both;<br/>
					he who is bent on the profit of neither.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>
					bent on his own profit, not another's?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person,<br/>
					as regards himself,<br/>
					abstains from killing,<br/>
					but does not incite another to do so;<br/>
					as regards himself,<br/>
					abstains from stealing,<br/>
					but does not incite another to do so;<br/>
					as regards himself,<br/>
					abstains from wrong conduct in sense-desires,<br/>
					but does not incite another to do so;<br/>
					as regards himself,<br/>
					abstains from lying,<br/>
					but does not incite another to do so;<br/>
					as regards himself,<br/>
					abstains from liquor fermented and distilled,<br/>
					but does not incite another so to abstain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is bent on his own profit,<br/>
					not another's</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>
					bent on another's profit,<br/>
					not his own?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br/>
					does not himself<br/>
					abstain from killing,<br/>
					but does incite another to do so;<br/>
					does not himself,<br/>
					abstain from stealing,<br/>
					but does incite another to do so;<br/>
					does not himself,<br/>
					abstain from wrong conduct in sense-desires,<br/>
					but does incite another to do so;<br/>
					does not himself,<br/>
					abstain from lying,<br/>
					but does incite another to do so;<br/>
					does not himself,<br/>
					abstain from liquor fermented and distilled,<br/>
					but does incite another so to abstain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person bent on another's profit,<br/>
					not his own</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent<br/>
					neither on his own<br/>
					nor on another's profit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br/>
					neither himself abstains<br/>
					nor incites another to abstain from killing<br/>
					neither himself abstains<br/>
					nor incites another to abstain from stealing,<br/>
					neither himself abstains<br/>
					nor incites another to abstain from wrong conduct in sense-desires,<br/>
					neither himself abstains<br/>
					nor incites another to abstain from lying,<br/>
					neither himself abstains<br/>
					nor incites another to abstain from liquor fermented and distilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is bent<br/>
					neither on his own<br/>
					nor on another's profit</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent<br/>
					both on his own profit<br/>
					and another's?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br/>
					both himself abstains from killing<br/>
					and incites another to do so,<br/>
					both himself abstains from stealing,<br/>
					and incites another to do so,<br/>
					both himself abstains from from wrong conduct in sense-desires,<br/>
					and incites another to do so,<br/>
					both himself abstains from lying,<br/>
					and incites another to do so,<br/>
					both himself abstains from liquor fermented and distilled<br/>
					and incites another to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is bent<br/>
					both on his own profit<br/>
					and another's</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>
