					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Potaliya the Wanderer came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him greeted him courteously.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having greeted him courteously he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he <span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span> sat at one side the Exalted One said this to Potaliya the Wanderer:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Potaliya, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Potaliya, a certain person<br/>
					speaks in dispraise<br/>
					of what deserves dispraise,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					seasonably saying what is a fact and true;<br/>
					but does not speak in praise<br/>
					of what deserves praise<br/>
					saying seasonably what is a fact and true.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Potaliya, a certain person<br/>
					speaks in praise<br/>
					of what deserves praise<br/>
					seasonably saying what is a fact and true,<br/>
					but speaks not in dispraise<br/>
					of what deserves dispraise,<br/>
					saying seasonably what is a fact and true.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again, Potaliya, a certain person<br/>
					speaks neither in dispraise<br/>
					of what deserves dispraise,<br/>
					seasonably saying what is a fact and true,<br/>
					nor speaks in praise<br/>
					of the praiseworthy,<br/>
					saying seasonably what is a fact and true.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, Potaliya, a certain person<br/>
					speaks both in dispraise<br/>
					of what deserves dispraise<br/>
					seasonably saying what is a fact and true<br/>
					and in praise<br/>
					of what is praiseworthy,<br/>
					saying seasonably what is a fact and true.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Potaliya, are the four persons found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Potaliya, of these four,<br/>
					which person in your view<br/>
					is to be accounted<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> most admirable and rare?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Master Gotama, a certain person<br/>
					speaks in dispraise<br/>
					of what deserves dispraise,<br/>
					seasonably saying what is a fact and true;<br/>
					but does not speak in praise<br/>
					of what deserves praise<br/>
					saying seasonably what is a fact and true.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Master Gotama, a certain person<br/>

					<p class="f4">Yet again, Master Gotama, a certain person<br/>
					speaks neither in dispraise<br/>

					<p class="f4">Once more, Master Gotama, a certain person<br/>

					<p class="f4">These, master Gotama, are the four persons found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these four persons, master Gotama,<br/>

					seasonably saying what is a fact and true,<br/>
					nor speaks in praise<br/>
					of the praiseworthy,<br/>
					saying seasonably what is a fact and true -<br/>
					this person in my view<br/>
					is to be accounted most admirable and rare of these four.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, master Gotama,<br/>
					his indifference<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is admirable."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, Potaliya, there are these four persons found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Potaliya,<br/>
					his discrimination of proper occasions<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> is admirable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, master Gotama, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Master Gotama, a certain person<br/>
					speaks in dispraise<br/>

					he is the most admirable and rare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, master Gotama, his discrimination of proper occasions is admirable.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, master Gotama,<br/>
					one should raise the fallen<br/>
					or show forth the hidden,<br/>
					or point the way<br/>
					to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br/>
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects,-<br/>
					even so in divers ways<br/>
					has dhamma been set forth by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama accept me as a lay-disciple<br/>
					from this time forth,<br/>
					as long as life may last,<br/>
					as one who has gone to him for refuge.'</p>
