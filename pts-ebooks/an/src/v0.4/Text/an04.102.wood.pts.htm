					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four rain-clouds.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The thunderer not the rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The rainer not the thunderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The neither thunderer nor rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The both thunderer and rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks, these four persons resembling rain-clouds<br/>
					are to be found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The thunderer not the rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The rainer not the thunderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The neither thunderer nor rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The both thunderer and rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, how is a person<br/>
					a thunderer but no rainer?</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a thunderer but not a rainer?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain person masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhamma and Vedalla.</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Yet he understands not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ending of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice going to the ending of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is one<br/>
					who thunders but rains not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as that rain-cloud thunders but rains not,<br/>
					even so using this figure<br/>
					do I speak of this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>
					one who rains but thunders not?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span> In this case a certain person does not master Dhamma,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhamma and Vedalla.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Yet he does understand,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is one who rains but thunders not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as that cloud rains but thunders not,<br/>
					so using this figure<br/>
					do I speak of this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks,<br/>
					is a person neither thunderer nor rainer?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person neither masters Dhamma,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhamma and Vedalla.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And he understands not,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Just as that cloud neither thunders nor rains,<br/>
					so using this figure<br/>
					do I speak of this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person both thunderer and rainer?

					In this case a certain person both masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhamma and Vedalla.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And he does understand,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, is a person who both thunders and rains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as that cloud both thunders and rains,<br/>
					so using this figure<br/>
					do I speak of this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the four persons found existing in the world.</p>
