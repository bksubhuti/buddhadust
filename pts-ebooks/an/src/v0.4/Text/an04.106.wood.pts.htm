					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four mangoes.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The unripe which looks ripe,<br/>
					the ripe which looks unripe,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[113]</b></span> the unripe which looks unripe,<br/>
					and the ripe which looks ripe.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four mangoes.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks, there are these four persons<br/>
					resembling mangoes<br/>
					found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The unripe which looks ripe,<br/>
					the ripe which looks unripe,<br/>
					the unripe which looks unripe,<br/>
					and the ripe which looks ripe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person unripe but ripe-looking?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case the mien of a certain person<br/>
					is charming,<br/>
					whether he be departing or approaching,<br/>
					looking forward or backward,<br/>
					bending or unbending (his arm),<br/>
					or bearing outer robe,<br/>
					bowl<br/>
					and (ordinary) robe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet he understands not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>

					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice going to the ending of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person<br/>
					is unripe but ripe-looking.</p>

					<p class="f4">As is that mango that is unripe but ripe-looking,<br/>
					even so using this figure<br/>
					do I speak of this person.</p>
