					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four snakes.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The venomous but not fierce,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					the fierce but not venomous,<br/>
					the one that is both venomous and fierce,<br/>
					the one that is neither venomous and fierce.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks, these four persons resembling snakes are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The venomous but not fierce,<br/>
					the fierce but not venomous,<br/>
					the one that is both venomous and fierce,<br/>
					the one that is neither venomous and fierce.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a person venomous but not fierce?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain person is quick to anger,<br/>
					but his anger lasts not long.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is venomous but not fierce.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as is that snake that is venomous but not fierce,<br/>
					so using this figure do I speak of this person.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person fierce but not venomous?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person is not quick to anger,<br/>
					but his anger lasts long.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is fierce but not venomous.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as is that snake that is fierce but not venomous,<br/>
					so using this figure do I speak of this person.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[116]</b></span> And how, monks, is a person both fierce and venomous?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person is quick to anger and his anger lasts long.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person neither fierce nor venomous?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person is neither quick to anger nor does his anger last long.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is neither fierce nor venomous</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as is that snake that is neither fierce nor venomous,<br/>
					so using this figure do I speak of this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four persons resembling snake that are found existing in the world.'</p>
