					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four goodly thoroughbred steeds<br/>
					are found existing in the world.<br/>
					What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, monks,<br/>
					we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed<br/>
					which at the very sight<br/>
					of the shadow of the goad-stick<br/>
					is stirred,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> feels agitation (thinking):</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'What<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> task, I wonder,<br/>
					will the trainer set me today?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What return<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> can I make him?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, monks, we may have such a steed,<br/>
					and this is the first sort<br/>
					of goodly thoroughbred steed<br/>
					found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, monks,<br/>
					we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed<br/>
					which is not stirred<br/>
					at the mere sight of the goad-stick,<br/>
					feels no agitation,<br/>
					but when his coat is pricked with <span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span> the goad,<br/>
					he is stirred, feels agitation (thinking):</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'What task, I wonder,<br/>
					will the trainer set me today?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What return can I make him?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, monks, we may have such a steed,<br/>
					and this is the second sort<br/>
					of goodly thoroughbred steed<br/>
					found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, monks,<br/>
					we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred steed<br/>
					which is not stirred<br/>
					at the sight of the goad-stick,<br/>
					nor yet when his coat is pricked with the goad,<br/>
					but when his flesh is pierced,<br/>
					he is stirred, he feels agitation (thinking):</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'What task, I wonder,<br/>
					will the trainer set me today?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What return can I make him?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, monks, we may have such a steed,<br/>
					and this is the third sort<br/>
					of goodly thoroughbred steed<br/>
					found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once more, monks,<br/>
					we may have a goodly thoroughbred steed<br/>
					which is stirred neither at the sight of the goad-stick<br/>
					nor when his coat is pricked,<br/>
					nor yet when his flesh is pierced by the goad-stick;<br/>
					but when he is pierced to the very bone,<br/>
					he is stirred, feels agitation (thinking):</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'What task, I wonder,<br/>
					will the trainer set me today?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What return can I make him?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Here we have such a goodly thoroughbred steed,<br/>
					and this is the fourth sort<br/>
					of goodly thoroughbred steed<br/>
					found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, monks, these four goodly thoroughbred steeds<br/>
					are found existing in the world."</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just in the same way, monks,<br/>
					these four goodly thoroughbred men<br/>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, monks,<br/>
					we may have a certain goodly thoroughbred man<br/>
					who hears is said<br/>
					that in such and such a village or township<br/>
					is a woman or man afflicted or dead.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereat he is stirred, he feels agitation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus agitated he strictly applies himself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus applied he both realizes in his own person<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					the supreme truth<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span>,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks,<br/>

					is stirred, feels agitation,<br/>
					even so using this figure do I speak of this goodly thoroughbred man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such in this case is the goodly thoroughbred man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the first sort<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon he is stirred, he feels agitation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such in this case is the goodly thoroughbred man.</p>
