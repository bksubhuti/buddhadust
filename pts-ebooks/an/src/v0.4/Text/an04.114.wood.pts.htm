					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities a rajah's elephant<br/>
					is worthy of the rajah,<br/>
					a possession of the rajah,<br/>
					is reckoned an attribute of a rajah.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four qualities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a rajah's elephant is a listener,<br/>
					a destroyer,<br/>
					a bearer,<br/>
					a goer.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a rajah's elephant a listener?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span> In this case, monks, whatever task<br/>
					the trainer of elephants to be driven<br/>
					imposes on him,<br/>
					whether he has performed it before or not,<br/>
					the rajah's elephant makes that his object,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					gives attention to it,<br/>
					considers it with all his mind,<br/>
					with ready ear listens thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, is a rajah's elephant a listener.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a rajah's elephant a destroyer?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br/>
					a rajah's elephant entering battle<br/>
					destroys elephant and mahout,<br/>
					horse and rider,<br/>
					chariot and driver and footman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is he a destroyer.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a rajah's elephant a bearer?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br/>
					a rajah's elephant entering battle<br/>
					bears the blows of spear,<br/>
					sword,<br/>
					arrow<br/>
					and axe,<br/>
					also the din of drum and kettledrum,<br/>
					of conch,<br/>
					tam-tam<br/>
					and other noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is a bearer.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a rajah's elephant a goer?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a rajah's elephant,<br/>
					in whatever direction the trainer of elephants to be driven turns him,<br/>
					whether he has gone there before or not,<br/>
					thither he quickly goes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is a goer.</p>

					<p class="f4">So possessed of these four qualities, monks,<br/>
					a rajah's elephant is worthy of the rajah,<br/>
					a possession of the rajah,<br/>
					is reckoned an attribute of a rajah.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks, possessed of four qualities a monk is worshipful,<br/>
					worthy of gifts and offerings,<br/>
					of salutations with clasped hands,<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk is a listener,<br/>
					a destroyer,<br/>
					a bearer<br/>
					and a goer.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk a listener?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, when Dhamma-discipline is set forth by a Tathāgata,<br/>
					a monk makes that his object,<br/>
					gives attention to it,<br/>
					considers it with all his mind,<br/>
					with ready ear listens to Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is a monk a listener.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk a destroyer?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk does not admit sensual thinking that has arisen,<br/>
					he abandons,<br/>
					restrains,<br/>
					makes an end of it,<br/>
					forces it not to recur.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also a monk does not admit malicious thinking that has arisen,<br/>
					he abandons,<br/>
					restrains,<br/>
					makes an end of it,<br/>
					forces it not to recur.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also a monk does not admit harmful thinking that has arisen,<br/>
					he abandons,<br/>
					restrains,<br/>
					makes an end of it,<br/>
					forces it not to recur.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not admit evil, unprofitable states<br/>
					that occur from time to time;<br/>
					he abandons them,<br/>
					restrains,<br/>
					makes an end of them,<br/>
					forces them not to recur.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is a destroyer.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk a bearer?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk bears heat,<br/>
					cold,<br/>
					hunger,<br/>
					thirst,<br/>
					contact of flies,<br/>
					mosquitoes,<br/>
					wind and sun<br/>
					and creeping things.</p>

					<p class="f4">He bears abusive, pain-causing ways<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> of speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">He submits to painful bodily feelings,<br/>
					grievous,<br/>
					sharp,<br/>
					racking,<br/>
					distracting<br/>
					and discomforting,<br/>
					that drain the life away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a monk is a bearer.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk a goer?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk quickly goes thither,<br/>
					whither in this long journey<br/>
					he has never gone before,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					to the calming of all the activities,<br/>
					to the forsaking of every basis of rebirth,<br/>
					to the destruction of craving,<br/>
					to passionlessness,<br/>
					to ending,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a monk is a goer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities a monk is worshipful,<br/>
					worthy of gifts and offerings,<br/>
					of salutations with clasped hands,<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>
