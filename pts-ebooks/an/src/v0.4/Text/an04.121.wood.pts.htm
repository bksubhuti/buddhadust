					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four fears.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Fear of self-reproach,<br/>
					fear of others' reproach,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					fear of punishment<br/>
					and fear of the way of woe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is fear of self-reproach?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">Were I to practise evil conduct in body, speech and thought,<br/>
					would not the self reproach me<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					as to virtue therein?</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly,<br/>
					scared by the fear of self-reproach,<br/>
					he abandons the practice<br/>
					of evil conduct in body, speech and thought,<br/>
					and makes-to-grow the practice<br/>
					of good conduct in body, speech and thought,<br/>
					and carries about<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> a pure self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					'fear of self-reproach.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is fear of others' reproach?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">Were I to practise evil conduct in body, speech and thought,<br/>
					would not others <span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span> reproach<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> me<br/>
					as to virtue therein?</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly,<br/>
					scared by the fear of others' reproach,<br/>
					he abandons the practice<br/>
					of evil conduct in body, speech and thought,<br/>
					and makes-to-grow the practice<br/>
					of good conduct in body, speech and thought,<br/>
					and carries about a pure self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					'the fear of others' reproach.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is fear of punishment?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one beholds the rajahs seizing a bandit,<br/>
					a miscreant,<br/>
					and subjecting him to divers forms of punishment;<br/>
					flogging him with whips,<br/>
					with canes<br/>
					or cudgels;<br/>
					cutting off his hand,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					his foot,<br/>
					hand and foot,<br/>
					his ear,<br/>
					nose,<br/>
					ear and nose;<br/>
					torturing him with the 'gruel-pot,'<br/>
					with the 'chank-shave'<br/>
					torturing him with 'Rahu's mouth,'<br/>
					with the 'fire-garland,'<br/>
					with the 'flaming hand,'<br/>
					with the 'hay-twist,'<br/>
					the 'bark-dress,'<br/>
					with the 'antelope,'<br/>
					with 'flesh-hooking,'<br/>
					with the 'disc-slice,'<br/>
					with the 'pickling process,'<br/>
					with 'circling the pin,'<br/>
					torturing him with the 'straw-mattress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they spray him with boiling oil,<br/>
					give him as food to dogs,<br/>
					spit him alive on a stake<br/>
					and chop his head off.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to do such deeds<br/>
					as those for which the rajahs seize a bandit,<br/>
					a miscreant,<br/>
					and so treat him to divers forms of punishment;<br/>
					flogging him with whips,<br/>
					with canes<br/>
					or cudgels;<br/>
					cutting off his hand,<br/>
					his foot,<br/>
					hand and foot,<br/>
					his ear,<br/>
					nose,<br/>
					ear and nose;<br/>
					torturing him with the 'gruel-pot,'<br/>
					with the 'chank-shave'<br/>
					torturing him with 'Rahu's mouth,'<br/>
					with the 'fire-garland,'<br/>
					with the 'flaming hand,'<br/>
					with the 'hay-twist,'<br/>
					the 'bark-dress,'<br/>
					with the 'antelope,'<br/>
					with 'flesh-hooking,'<br/>
					with the 'disc-slice,'<br/>
					with the 'pickling process,'<br/>
					with 'circling the pin,'<br/>
					torturing him with the 'straw-mattress'<br/>
					or they spray him with boiling oil,<br/>
					give him as food to dogs,<br/>
					spit him alive on a stake<br/>
					or chop his head off<br/>
					they would surely treat me<br/>
					to divers forms of punishment;<br/>
					flogging me with whips,<br/>
					with canes<br/>
					or cudgels;<br/>
					cutting off my hand,<br/>
					my foot,<br/>
					my hand and foot,<br/>
					my ear,<br/>
					nose,<br/>
					my ear and nose;<br/>
					torturing me with the 'gruel-pot,'<br/>
					with the 'chank-shave'<br/>
					torturing me with 'Rahu's mouth,'<br/>
					with the 'fire-garland,'<br/>
					with the 'flaming hand,'<br/>

					torturing me with the 'straw-mattress'<br/>
					or they would spray me with boiling oil,<br/>
					give me as food to dogs,<br/>
					spit me alive on a stake<br/>
					or chop my head off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus scared by the fear of punishment<br/>
					he goes not about plundering others' property.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					'fear of punishment.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the fear of the way of woe?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who practises<br/>
					evil conduct in body, speech and thought<br/>
					there is a bad result in the life to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now if I were to practise<br/>
					evil conduct in body, speech and thought,<br/>
					when body breaks up,<br/>
					should not I be reborn after death<br/>
					in the waste,<br/>
					the way of woe,<br/>
					the downfall,<br/>
					in purgatory?</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly,<br/>
					scared by the fear of the way of woe<br/>
					he abandons the practice<br/>
					of evil conduct<br/>
					and makes-to-grow<br/>
					the practice of good conduct in body, speech and thought,<br/>
					and carries about a pure self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the<br/>
					'fear of the way of woe.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four fears."</p>
