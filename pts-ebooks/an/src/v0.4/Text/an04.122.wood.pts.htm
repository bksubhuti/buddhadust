					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four perils to be looked for<br/>
					in him who goes down to the water.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Peril of waves,<br/>
					peril of crocodiles,<br/>
					peril of whirlpools,<br/>
					and peril of sea-monsters.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four perils.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks, in some clansman here<br/>
					who has gone forth from the home<br/>
					to the homeless life<br/>
					under this Dhamma-discipline<br/>
					these four perils may be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Peril of waves,<br/>
					peril of crocodiles,<br/>
					peril of whirlpools<br/>
					and peril of sea-monsters.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is peril of waves?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain clansman<br/>
					who has in faith gone forth<br/>
					from home to the homeless life,<br/>
					thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here am I, launched upon birth,<br/>
					old age<br/>
					and death,<br/>
					on sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe,<br/>
					lamentation<br/>
					and despair,<br/>
					launched upon Ill,<br/>
					overwhelmed by Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe of all this mass of Ill<br/>
					some ending may be shown.</p>

					<p class="f4">To such an one who has thus<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> gone forth<br/>
					his fellows in the God-life preach,<br/>
					and admonish him,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus should you retreat,<br/>
					thus advance;<br/>
					thus should you look forward<br/>
					and backward,<br/>
					bend or unbend (your arm);<br/>
					thus should you bear outer robe<br/>
					and bowl<br/>
					and inner robe.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I who aforetime lived at home<br/>
					was wont to preach to<br/>
					and admonish others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet these people,<br/>
					who are to my thinking<br/>
					no more than sons or grandsons,-<br/>
					these people think that I am one to be preached to<br/>
					and admonished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he, angered and offended,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					abandons the training<br/>
					and turns back to the low life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br/>
					'a monk who abandons the training<br/>
					and turns back to the low life,<br/>
					scared by the peril of waves.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Peril of the waves,' monks,<br/>
					is a term for wrath and resentment.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'peril of waves.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span> And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is peril of crocodiles?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain clansman<br/>
					has in faith gone forth<br/>

					<p class="f4">He thinks thus:</p>

					launched upon Ill,<br/>
					overwhelmed by Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe of all this mass of Ill<br/>
					some ending may be shown.</p>

					<p class="f4">To such an one<br/>
					who has thus gone forth<br/>
					his fellows in the God-life<br/>
					preach and admonish him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You should eat this,<br/>
					not that.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should swallow<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> this,<br/>
					not that.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should taste this,<br/>
					not that.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should drink this,<br/>
					not that.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should eat,<br/>
					swallow,<br/>
					taste<br/>
					and drink<br/>
					what is fitting,<br/>
					not what is unfitting.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should eat,<br/>
					swallow,<br/>
					taste<br/>
					and drink<br/>
					at the proper,<br/>
					not at the improper time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I who aforetime lived at home<br/>
					used to eat,<br/>
					swallow,<br/>
					taste<br/>
					and drink<br/>
					just what I liked,<br/>
					and refused to eat,<br/>
					swallow,<br/>
					taste<br/>
					and drink<br/>
					what I did not like.</p>

					<p class="f4">I used to eat,<br/>
					swallow,<br/>
					taste<br/>
					and drink<br/>
					both what was fitting<br/>
					and unfitting,<br/>
					and that too<br/>
					whether the time was proper<br/>
					or improper.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now<br/>
					when believing householders offer me choice food<br/>
					both hard and soft<br/>
					at an improper time,<br/>
					methinks they are putting a bridle<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> on my mouth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he abandons the training<br/>
					and turns back to the low life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br/>
					'a monk who abandons the training<br/>
					and turns back to the low life<br/>
					because he is scared by the peril of crocodiles.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Peril of crocodiles,' monks,<br/>
					is a term for gluttony.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'peril of crocodiles.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is peril of whirlpools?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain clansman<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					has in faith gone forth<br/>
					from home to the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here am I launched upon birth,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Maybe of all this mass of Ill<br/>

					<p class="f4">He having thus gone forth,<br/>
					robing himself in the forenoon<br/>
					and taking bowl and robe,<br/>
					sets out for village or township<br/>
					to beg an alms,<br/>
					with body unguarded,<br/>
					with speech unguarded,<br/>
					with thoughts unguarded,<br/>
					with mindfulness <span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span> not established,<br/>
					with faculties uncontrolled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he sees a housefather<br/>
					or son of a housefather<br/>
					indulging in,<br/>
					provided with<br/>
					and practising the five sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I too aforetime<br/>
					when living at home<br/>
					indulged in,<br/>
					was provided with<br/>
					and practised the five sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover<br/>
					since wealth exists in my family,<br/>
					I could enjoy it<br/>
					and do good works therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">How now if I were to abandon the training,<br/>
					turn back to the low life,<br/>
					enjoy my wealth<br/>
					and do good deeds therewith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly he abandons the training,<br/>
					turn back to the low life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br/>
					'a monk who abandons the training<br/>

					because he is scared by the peril of whirlpools.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Peril of whirlpools,' monks,<br/>
					is a term for the five sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					'peril of whirlpools.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the peril of sea-monsters?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain clansman<br/>
					who has in faith gone forth<br/>
					from the home to the homeless life<br/>
					thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here am I launched upon birth,<br/>
					old age and death,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Maybe of all this mass of Ill<br/>

					<p class="f4">He, having thus gone forth,<br/>

					with body unguarded,<br/>
					with speech unguarded,<br/>
					with thoughts unguarded,<br/>
					with mindfulness not established,<br/>
					with faculties uncontrolled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he sees womenfolk<br/>
					partly clothed,<br/>
					partly attired.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing that sight<br/>
					passion assails<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> his heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">With heart assailed by passion<br/>
					he abandons the training<br/>
					and turns back to the low life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br/>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four perils<br/>
