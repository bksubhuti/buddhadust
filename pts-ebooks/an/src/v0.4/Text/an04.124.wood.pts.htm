					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, a certain person here,<br/>
					aloof from sense-desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil conditions,<br/>
					enters upon the first musing,<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					feeling,<br/>
					perception,<br/>
					the activities,<br/>
					consciousness,<br/>
					those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br/>
					as Ill,<br/>
					as a disease,<br/>
					as an imposthume,<br/>
					as a barb,<br/>
					as pain,<br/>
					ill-health,<br/>
					alien,<br/>
					transitory,<br/>
					as empty<br/>
					and not of the self.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>
					he is reborn in the company<br/>
					of the devas of the Pure Abodes.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a certain person here,<br/>
					by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					enters upon the second musing,<br/>
					that calming of the inner self,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of mind<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br/>
					feeling,<br/>
					perception,<br/>
					the activities,<br/>
					consciousness,<br/>
					those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br/>
					as Ill,<br/>
					as a disease,<br/>
					as an imposthume,<br/>
					as a barb,<br/>
					as pain,<br/>
					ill-health,<br/>
					alien,<br/>
					transitory,<br/>
					as empty<br/>
					and not of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>
					he is reborn in the company<br/>
					of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a certain person here,<br/>
					by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					disinterested,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					experiences in his own person<br/>
					that ease of which the Ariyans declare:<br/>
					"He who is disinterested and alert<br/>
					dwells at ease,"<br/>
					— thus he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br/>
					feeling,<br/>
					perception,<br/>
					the activities,<br/>
					consciousness,<br/>
					those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br/>
					as Ill,<br/>
					as a disease,<br/>
					as an imposthume,<br/>
					as a barb,<br/>
					as pain,<br/>
					ill-health,<br/>
					alien,<br/>
					transitory,<br/>
					as empty<br/>
					and not of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>
					he is reborn in the company<br/>
					of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, monks, a certain person here,<br/>
					by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br/>
					by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br/>
					attains the fourth musing,<br/>
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br/>
					an equanimity of utter purity,<br/>
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br/>
					feeling,<br/>
					perception,<br/>
					the activities,<br/>
					consciousness,<br/>
					those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br/>
					as Ill,<br/>
					as a disease,<br/>
					as an imposthume,<br/>
					as a barb,<br/>
					as pain,<br/>
					ill-health,<br/>
					alien,<br/>
					transitory,<br/>
					as empty<br/>
					and not of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>
					he is reborn in the company<br/>
					of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these four persons are found existing in the world.'</p>
