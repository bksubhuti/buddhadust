					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person lives<br/>
					irradiating one quarter (of the world)<br/>
					with a heart possessed of amity;<br/>
					so also as to the second,<br/>
					third<br/>
					and fourth quarter of the world;<br/>
					and in like manner above,<br/>
					below,<br/>
					across,<br/>
					everywhere,<br/>
					for all sorts and conditions,<br/>
					he lives irradiating the whole world<br/>
					with a heart <span class="f2 g"><b>[133]</b></span> possessed of amity<br/>
					that is widespread,<br/>
					grown great<br/>
					and boundless,<br/>
					free from enmity<br/>
					and untroubled.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys the sweetness of it,<br/>
					longs for it<br/>
					and finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>
					given thereto,<br/>
					generally spending his time therein<br/>
					and not falling away therefrom,<br/>
					when he makes an end<br/>
					he is reborn in the company of devas of the Brahma-group.</p>

					<p class="f4">A kalpa, monks, is the life-span<br/>
					of the devas of the Brahmā-group.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>
					and spends his time<br/>
					according to the life-span of those devas;<br/>
					then he goes to purgatory<br/>
					or the womb of an animal,<br/>
					he goes to the peta-realm.</p>

					<p class="f4">But a disciple of the Exalted One,<br/>
					after staying there<br/>
					and spending his time<br/>
					according to the life-span of those devas,<br/>
					finally passes away in that same state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the distinction,<br/>
					such the specific feature,<br/>
					the difference between the learned Ariyan disciple<br/>
					and the unlearned ordinary man<br/>
					in the matter of bourn and rebirth.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, a certain person here<br/>
					lives irradiating one quarter of the world<br/>
					with a heart possessed of compassion;<br/>
					so also as to the second,<br/>
					third<br/>
					and fourth quarter of the world;<br/>
					and in like manner above,<br/>
					below,<br/>
					across,<br/>
					everywhere,<br/>
					for all sorts and conditions,<br/>
					he lives irradiating the whole world<br/>
					with a heart possessed of compassion<br/>
					that is widespread,<br/>
					grown great<br/>
					and boundless,<br/>
					free from enmity<br/>
					and untroubled.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys the sweetness of it,<br/>
					longs for it<br/>
					and finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>
					given thereto,<br/>
					generally spending his time therein<br/>
					and not falling away therefrom,<br/>
					when he makes an end<br/>
					he is reborn in the company of the Radiant devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the life-span of those devas is two kalpas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>
					and spends his time<br/>
					according to the life-span of those devas;<br/>
					then he goes to purgatory<br/>
					or the womb of an animal,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, a certain person here<br/>
					lives irradiating one quarter of the world<br/>
					with a heart possessed of sympathy;<br/>
					so also as to the second,<br/>
					third<br/>
					and fourth quarter of the world;<br/>
					and in like manner above,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the life-span of those devas is four kalpas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>
					and spends his time<br/>
					according to the life-span of those devas;<br/>
					then he goes to purgatory<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, a certain person here<br/>
					lives irradiating one quarter of the world<br/>
					with a heart possessed of equanimity;<br/>
					so also as to the second,<br/>
					third<br/>
					and fourth quarter of the world;<br/>
					and in like manner above,<br/>
					below,<br/>
					across,<br/>
					everywhere,<br/>
					for all sorts and conditions,<br/>
					he lives irradiating the whole world<br/>

					generally spending his time therein<br/>
					and not falling away therefrom,<br/>
					when he makes an end<br/>
					he is reborn in the company of the Vehapphala devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the life-span of the Vehapphala devas is five hundred kalpas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>
					and spends his time<br/>
					according to the life-span of those devas;<br/>
					then he goes to purgatory<br/>

					<p class="f4">So these four persons are found existing in the world.'</p>
