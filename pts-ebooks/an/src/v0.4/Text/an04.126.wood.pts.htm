					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person lives<br/>
					irradiating one quarter (of the world)<br/>
					with a heart possessed of amity;<br/>
					so also as to the second,<br/>
					third<br/>
					and fourth quarter of the world;<br/>
					and in like manner above,<br/>
					below,<br/>
					across,<br/>
					everywhere,<br/>
					for all sorts and conditions,<br/>
					he lives irradiating the whole world<br/>
					with a heart possessed of amity<br/>
					that is widespread,<br/>
					grown great<br/>
					and boundless,<br/>
					free from enmity<br/>
					and untroubled.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br/>
					feeling,<br/>
					perception,<br/>
					the activities,<br/>
					consciousness,<br/>
					those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br/>
					as Ill,<br/>
					as a disease,<br/>
					as an imposthume,<br/>
					as a barb,<br/>
					as pain,<br/>
					ill-health,<br/>
					alien,<br/>
					transitory,<br/>
					as empty<br/>
					and not of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>
					he is reborn in the company<br/>
					of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>
