					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, on the manifestation of a Tathāgata,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					four wonderful, marvellous things<br/>
					are manifested.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">When a Bodhisattva, deceasing from the Tusita-deva-group,<br/>
					mindful and composed<br/>
					descends into his mother's womb,<br/>
					then in the world,<br/>
					together with its devas,<br/>
					its Maras,<br/>
					its Brahmas,<br/>
					with its host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					of devas and mankind,<br/>
					then an infinite,<br/>
					glorious radiance is manifested,<br/>
					surpassing the deva-majesty of the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even the gloom of space between the worlds,<br/>
					the fathomless<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> darkness,<br/>
					the murk of darkness,<br/>
					where even the radiance of our moon and sun,<br/>
					though of such wondrous power and majesty,<br/>
					cannot be manifested, -<br/>
					even there an infinite,<br/>
					glorious radiance is spread abroad,<br/>
					surpassing the deva-majesty of the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise those creatures that have come into being there,<br/>
					becoming aware of each other through that radiance,<br/>
					exclaim:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It seems, friends,<br/>
					that there be other creatures also<br/>
					that have come into being here."</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, on the manifestation of a Tathāgata,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					this is the first wonderful,<br/>
					marvellous thing manifested.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, when a Bodhisattva,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					comes forth from his mother's womb,<br/>
					then in the world,<br/>
