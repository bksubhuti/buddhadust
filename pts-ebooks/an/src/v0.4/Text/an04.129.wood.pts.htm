					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four<br/>
					wonderful, marvellous things about Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[136]</b></span> If a company of monks comes to visit Ānanda,<br/>
					they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of monks<br/>
					when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of nuns comes to visit Ānanda,<br/>
					they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma<br/>
					they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of nuns<br/>
					when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of disciples who are laymen<br/>
					comes to visit Ānanda,<br/>
					they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma<br/>
					they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of disciples who are laymen<br/>
					when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of disciples who are laywomen<br/>
					comes to visit Ānanda,<br/>
					they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma<br/>
					they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of disciples<br/>
					that are laywomen<br/>
					when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four wonderful, marvellous things about Ānanda.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> here does not allow that A. preached Dhamma (as doctrine) to these people, but suggests that he 'asked about their health, whether they were attending to their exercises, and were dutiful to their superiors. Speaking to women, he asks whether they are observing the eight ordinances for behaviour towards monks. To lay folk, not 'Does your head ache? Are your children and wives well?' but, 'Do you keep the precepts? Do you feed holy men? But see § 169 below, where he is found teaching Dhamma, [?] and again §§ 170, 204.</p>
