					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four persons found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, in a certain person<br/>
					the fetters that pertain to this world are not got rid of,<br/>
					those that give rise to rebirth are not got rid of,<br/>
					those that give rise to becoming are not got rid of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again in a certain person<br/>
					the fetters that pertain to this world are got rid of,<br/>
					but not those that give rise to rebirth,<br/>
					and not those that give rise to becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again in a certain person<br/>
					the fetters that pertain to this world are got rid of,<br/>
					and those that give rise to rebirth are got rid of,<br/>
					but not those that give rise to becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again in a certain person<br/>
					the fetters that pertain to this world are got rid of,<br/>
					and those that give rise to rebirth are got rid of,<br/>
					and those that give rise to becoming are got rid of.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, in what sort of person<br/>
					are the fetters that pertain to this world not got rid of,<br/>
					those that give rise to rebirth not got rid of,<br/>
					those that give rise to becoming not got rid of?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Once-returner.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this person<br/>
					the fetters that pertain to this world are not got rid of,<br/>
					those that give rise to rebirth are not got rid of,<br/>
					those that give rise to becoming are not got rid of.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, in what sort of person<br/>
					are the fetters that pertain to this world got rid of,<br/>
					but not those that give rise to rebirth,<br/>
					and not those that give rise to becoming?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the one who goes upstream,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					who goes to the Elder Devas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					the fetters that pertain to this world are got rid of,<br/>
					but not those that give rise to rebirth,<br/>
					and not those that give rise to becoming</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, in what sort of person<br/>
					are the fetters that pertain to this world got rid of,<br/>
					and those that give rise to rebirth are got rid of,<br/>
					but not those that give rise to becoming?</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who passes finally away in mid-term<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					the fetters that pertain to this world are got rid of,<br/>
					and those that give rise to rebirth are got rid of,<br/>
					but not those that give rise to becoming.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, in what sort of person<br/>
					are the fetters that pertain to this world got rid of,<br/>
					and those that give rise to rebirth are got rid of,<br/>
					and those that give rise to becoming are got rid of?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this person, monks,<br/>
					the fetters pertaining to this world are got rid of,<br/>
					and those that give rise to rebirth are got rid of,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So these are the four sorts of persons found existing in the world.'</p>
