					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who lives on the fruit of his effort,<br/>
					not of his deed:<br/>
					he who lives on the fruit of his deed,<br/>
					not of his effort:<br/>
					he who lives on the fruit of his effort and<br/>
					on the fruit of his deed:<br/>
					he who lives neither on the fruit of his effort nor<br/>
					on the fruit of his deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>

Rajahs and royal ministers live on both. Beings in purgatory form the fourth class.</p>
