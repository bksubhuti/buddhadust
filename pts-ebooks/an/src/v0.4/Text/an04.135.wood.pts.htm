					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The blameworthy,<br/>
					the very blameworthy,<br/>
					the slightly blameworthy,<br/>
					the blameless.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person blameworthy?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>
					is liable to blame<br/>
					for his deeds in body,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is blameworthy.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person very blameworthy?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>
					is liable to much blame<br/>
					for his deeds in body,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and thought,<br/>
					and to slight blame<br/>
					for deeds that are blameless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is more to be blamed than praised.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person only slightly blameworthy?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>
					is liable to little blame<br/>
					for his deeds in body,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and thought,<br/>
					and to little blame<br/>
					for deeds that are blameworthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is only slightly blameworthy.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a person blameless?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>
					is not to be blamed at all<br/>
					for his deeds in body,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is blameless.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four persons found existing in the world'</p>
