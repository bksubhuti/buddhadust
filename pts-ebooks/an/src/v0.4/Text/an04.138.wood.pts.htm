					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The subdued<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> in body<br/>
					but not in mind;<br/>
					the unsubdued in body<br/>
					but subdued in mind;<br/>
					he who is subdued in neither;<br/>
					he who is subdued in both.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>
					subdued in body<br/>
					but not in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>
					makes his bed and lodging<br/>
					in the lonely glades<br/>
					and solitude of a forest,<br/>
					but meanwhile thinks sensual thoughts,<br/>
					malicious thoughts<br/>
					and harmful thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person<br/>
					is subdued in body<br/>
					but unsubdued in mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a person<br/>
					unsubdued in body<br/>
					but subdued in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>
					makes not his bed and lodging<br/>
					in the lonely glades<br/>
					and solitude of a forest,<br/>
					yet meanwhile he thinks unworldly thoughts,<br/>
					thoughts not malicious,<br/>
					not harmful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person<br/>
					is unsubdued in body<br/>
					but subdued in mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span> And how is a person<br/>
					subdued neither in body<br/>
					nor in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>
					makes not his bed and lodging<br/>
					in the lonely glades<br/>
					and solitude of a forest,<br/>
					yet meanwhile thinks sensual thoughts,<br/>
					malicious thoughts<br/>
					and harmful thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person<br/>
					is subdued neither in body<br/>
					nor in mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And how is a person<br/>
					subdued both in body<br/>
					and in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>
					makes his bed and lodging<br/>
					in the lonely glades<br/>
					and solitude of a forest,<br/>
					and at the same time<br/>
					he thinks unworldly thoughts,<br/>
					thoughts not malicious,<br/>
					not harmful thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is subdued both in body and in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these four persons are found existing in the world.'</p>
