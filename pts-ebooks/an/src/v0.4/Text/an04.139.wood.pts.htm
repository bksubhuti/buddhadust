					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four talkers of Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person talking Dhamma<br/>
					says little<br/>
					and that not to the point;<br/>
					while his company is unskilled to judge<br/>
					what is to the point<br/>
					or otherwise.</p>

						
					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the Dhamma-talker,<br/>
					and he is reckoned to talk<br/>
					to a company of like nature.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, a certain person talking Dhamma<br/>
					says little<br/>
					and that to the point,<br/>
					while his company is skilled to judge<br/>
					what is to the point<br/>
					or otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the Dhamma-talker,<br/>
					and he is reckoned to talk<br/>
					to a company of like nature.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, a certain person talking Dhamma<br/>
					says much<br/>
					and what is off the point,<br/>
					while his company is unskilled to judge<br/>
					what is to the point<br/>
					or otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the Dhamma-talker,<br/>
					and he is reckoned to talk<br/>
					to a company of like nature.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, a certain person talking Dhamma<br/>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the Dhamma-talker, and he is reckoned to talk to a company of like nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the four Dhamma-talkers."</p>
