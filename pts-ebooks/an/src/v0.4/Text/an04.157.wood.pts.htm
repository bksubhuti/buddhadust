					<p class="f4">'Monks, there are these two diseases.</p>

					<p class="f4">What two?</p>

					<p class="f4">Disease of body and disease of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are to be seen beings who can admit freedom from suffering from bodily disease for one year,<br/>
					for two years,<br/>
					for three,<br/>
					four,<br/>
					five,<br/>
					ten,<br/>
					twenty,<br/>
					thirty,<br/>
					forty,<br/>
					fifty years;<br/>
					who can admit freedom from bodily disease for even a hundred years.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, those beings are hard to find in the world<br/>
					who can admit freedom from mental disease<br/>
					even for one moment,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					save only those in whom the āsavas are destroyed.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are these four diseases<br/>
					of one who has gone forth (from the worldly life).</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, monks, we may have a greedy one,<br/>
					full of vexation,<br/>
					discontented with this or that supply<br/>
					of robe and alms-food,<br/>
					lodging,<br/>
					seat,<br/>
					medicines<br/>
					and requisites for sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being greedy and so forth,<br/>
					full of vexation,<br/>
					discontented with this or that supply<br/>
					of robe and alms-food,<br/>
					lodging,<br/>
					seat,<br/>
					medicines<br/>
					and requisites for sickness<br/>
					conceived<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> an evil longing for consideration,<br/>
					for gain,<br/>
					honours<br/>
					and fame.</p>

					<p class="f4">He rouses himself,<br/>
					exerts himself,<br/>
					makes an effort to get these things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of set purpose<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> he visits families,<br/>
					of set purpose he takes a seat,<br/>
					of set purpose he speaks Dhamma,<br/>
					of set purpose he restrains the calls of nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four diseases<br/>
					of him who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, monks, thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">We will not become greedy,<br/>
					full of vexation,<br/>
					discontented with this or that supply<br/>
					of robe and alms-food,<br/>
					lodging,<br/>
					seat,<br/>
					medicines<br/>
					and requisites for sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will not conceive an evil longing for consideration,<br/>
					for gain,<br/>
					honours<br/>
					and fame.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will not rouse ourselves,<br/>
					exert ourselves,<br/>
					make an effort to get these things.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will become enduring of cold,<br/>
					hunger,<br/>
					thirst,<br/>
					contact of flies and mosquitoes,<br/>
					of wind and rain and creeping things.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">We will become bearers of abusive,<br/>
					pain-causing ways of speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will submit to painful bodily <span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span> feelings,<br/>
					grievous,<br/>
					sharp,<br/>
					racking,<br/>
					distracting<br/>
					and discomforting,<br/>
					that drain the life away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, must ye train yourselves,'</p>
