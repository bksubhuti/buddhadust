					<p class="f4">"Monks,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sir,' replied those monks to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">I am falling away in good qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was called "falling away" by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Abundance of lust,<br/>
					abundance of hatred,<br/>
					abundance of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, into profound matters,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This was called "Not failing away" by the Exalted One.</p>
