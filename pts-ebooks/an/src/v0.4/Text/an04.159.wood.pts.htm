					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying at Kosambī, in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion a certain nun<br/>
					addressed a certain man, saying:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span> 'Come, thou good fellow!</p>

					<p class="f4">Go to master Ānanda,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					in my name worship with thy head<br/>
					the feet of the worthy Ānanda<br/>
					and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, a nun named so and so is sick,<br/>
					in pain,<br/>
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">She worships with her head<br/>
					the feet of the worthy Ānanda.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'And do you say this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be a good thing, sir,<br/>
					if the worthy Ānanda would visit the nuns' lodging<br/>
					where that nun is,<br/>
					out of compassion for her."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lady,'replied that man,<br/>
					and went to the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, a nun named so and so is sick,<br/>
					in pain,<br/>
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">She worships with her head<br/>
					the feet of the worthy Ānanda.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be a good thing, sir,<br/>
					if the worthy Ānanda would visit the nuns' lodging<br/>
					where that nun is,<br/>
					out of compassion for her."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					robing himself and taking bowl and outer robe,<br/>
					went to visit that nun.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that nun saw the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					from afar as he was coming,<br/>
					and on seeing him<br/>
					she covered her head<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					and lay down on a couch.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to where she was,<br/>
					and on reaching her<br/>
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat there<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said this to that nun:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[3][than][olds]</span>'Sister, this body has come into being through food,<br/>

					is dependent on craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving must be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sister, this body has come into being through pride,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Pride must be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sister, this body has come into being through sexual intercourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sexual intercourse must be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">The breaking down of the bridge<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					which is in sexual intercourse<br/>
					has been spoken of by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span> Sister, as to this saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, sister, a monk takes food<br/>

					not for personal charm,<br/>
					not for beautifying,<br/>
					but just enough for the support,<br/>
					for the upkeep of body,<br/>
					for its resting unharmed,<br/>
					for helping the living of the God-life.</p>

					<p class="f4">(He takes food with the thought:)</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus do I check my former feeling<br/>
					and set going no new feeling;<br/>
					thus maintenance shall be mine,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					blamelessness and comfort in life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then some time later,<br/>

					he abandons food.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to the saying that body has come into being through food,<br/>
					whatever was thus said was said in this connexion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the nun rose from the couch,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> asserts that she was enamoured of Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> It is contrary to Vinaya rules for a nun or female devotee (<i>Pāṭimokkha, Sekhiya</i>) to hear Dhamma with head covered or reclining or wearing sandals. Strangely <i>Comy.</i> does not notice it. But <i>cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> iv, 78 f., where a brahmin lady is rebuked by Udāyin for so doing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> remarks that in order to disillusion her of her passion he spoke of the 'foul things '(<i>asubha-kathaṃ</i>).</p>

Our text reads <i>methuno ca setughāto vutto</i> (which would mean 'sexual intercourse and bridge-breaking'); while the <i>Siamese</i> text reads <i>methune pahātabbo, methune setu-ghāto,</i> which is preferable. <i>Sinh.</i> text has <i>methune</i> only (the proper construction acc. to other passages where the phrase occurs). Here I follow the <i>Siamese</i> text. The saying is not recorded, as far as I know.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> ii, 98 (<i>Maṅsaputta</i>), iv, 104; <i>Expos,</i> ii, 511; <i>VM.</i> 31; <i>supra,</i> § 37. <i>Comy.</i> says nothing here nor at <i>S.</i> ii <i>loc. cit.,</i> but refers to <i>VM. loc. cit,</i> which equals <i>Expositor loc. cit.</i></p>
