					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four modes of progress.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The painful mode of progress with sluggish intuition,<br/>
					the painful mode with swift intuition,<br/>
					the pleasant mode of progress with sluggish intuition,<br/>
					the pleasant mode with swift intuition.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four modes of progress.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the painful mode of progress<br/>
					with sluggish intuition?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> lives contemplating the unloveliness in body,<br/>
					aware of the repulsiveness of food,<br/>
					aware of his distaste for all the world,<br/>
					aware of impermanence in all the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus awareness of death<br/>
					is implanted in the very self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives dependent<br/>
					on these five powers of a pupil:<br/>
					the power of faith,<br/>
					the power of modesty,<br/>
					that of self-restraint,<br/>
					that of energy,<br/>
					and the power of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in him these five controlling faculties<br/>
					are dully manifested, to wit:<br/>
					the controlling faculty of faith,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>
					and the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, owing to the dullness<br/>
					of these five controlling faculties,<br/>
					sluggish is his attainment<br/>
					of the concentration that follows on<br/>
					for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					"the mode of progress that is painful<br/>
					with sluggish intuition."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[156]</b></span> And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the mode of progress that is painful,<br/>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk lives<br/>
					contemplating the unloveliness in body,<br/>

					the power of modesty,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But in him these five controlling faculties are manifested in abundance, to wit:<br/>
					the controlling faculty of faith,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>
					and the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, owing to the preponderance<br/>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

					but with sluggish intuition?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk,<br/>
					aloof from sense-desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil conditions,<br/>
					enters upon the first musing,<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the calming down<br/>
					of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					enters upon the second musing,<br/>
					that calming of the inner self,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of mind<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					disinterested,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					experiences in his own person<br/>
					that ease of which the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He who is disinterested and alert dwells at ease."</p>

					<p class="f4">So he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br/>
					by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br/>
					he attains the fourth musing,<br/>
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br/>
					an equanimity of utter purity,<br/>
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives dependent<br/>
					on these five powers of a pupil:<br/>
