					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four modes of progress.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The mode of progress that is painful<br/>
					with sluggish intuition,<br/>
					the mode of progress that is painful<br/>
					with swift intuition,<br/>
					the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>
					with sluggish intuition,<br/>
					and the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>
					and accompanied with swift intuition.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now here, monks, the mode of progress that is painful<br/>
					with sluggish intuition<br/>
					is reckoned low<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in both respects,<br/>
					both as regards its pain<br/>
					and its sluggishness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is reckoned low in both respects.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br/>
					the mode of progress that is painful<br/>
					with swift intuition<br/>
					is reckoned low in respect of its being painful.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br/>
					the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>
					with sluggish intuition<br/>
					is reckoned low in respect of its being sluggish.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again, monks, the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>
					with swift intuition<br/>
					is reckoned excellent in both respects,<br/>
					both as regards its pleasantness<br/>
					and its swiftness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is reckoned excellent in both respects.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the four modes of progress.'</p>
