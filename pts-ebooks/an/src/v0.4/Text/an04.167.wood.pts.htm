					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta went to visit the venerable Moggallāna the Great, and on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Sāriputta said this to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Moggallāna, your reverence,<br/>
					there are these four modes of progress.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The mode of progress that is painful<br/>
					with sluggish intuition,<br/>
					the mode of progress that is painful<br/>
					with swift intuition,<br/>
					the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>
					with sluggish intuition,<br/>
					and the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>
					and accompanied with swift intuition.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, your reverence,<br/>
					by way of which of these four modes of progress<br/>
					was your heart released from the āsavas without grasping?</p>
