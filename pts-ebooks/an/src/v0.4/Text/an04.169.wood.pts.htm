					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br/>
					in this very life is set free,<br/>
					but with some effort.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Again a certain person<br/>
					is set free when body breaks up,<br/>
					but with some effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, <span class="f2 g"><b>[161]</b></span> a certain person<br/>
					is set free in this very life,<br/>
					but without effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again a certain person<br/>
					is set free<br/>
					when body breaks up,<br/>
					but without effort.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, how is a person<br/>
					one who in this very life is set free,<br/>
					but with some effort?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk lives contemplating the unloveliness in body,<br/>
					aware of the repulsiveness of food,<br/>
					aware of his distaste for all the world,<br/>
					aware of impermanence in all the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus awareness of death<br/>
					is well implanted in the very self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives dependent<br/>
					on these five powers of a pupil,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					the power of faith,<br/>
					the power of modesty,<br/>
					the power of self-restraint,<br/>
					the power of energy,<br/>
					the power of power of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him these five controlling faculties<br/>
					are manifested in abundance,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					the controlling faculty of faith,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, by the preponderance of these five controlling faculties<br/>
					in this very life, he is set free,<br/>
					but with some effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>
					set free when body breaks up,<br/>
					but with some effort?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk lives contemplating the unloveliness in body,<br/>
					aware of the repulsiveness of food,<br/>
					aware of his distaste for all the world,<br/>
					aware of impermanence in all the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus awareness of death<br/>
					is well implanted in the very self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives dependent<br/>
					on these five powers of a pupil,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					the power of faith,<br/>
					the power of modesty,<br/>
					the power of self-restraint,<br/>
					the power of energy,<br/>
					the power of power of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him these five controlling faculties<br/>
					are dully manifested,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					the controlling faculty of faith,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, by the dullness of these faculties,<br/>
					he is set free<br/>
					with some effort<br/>
					when body breaks up.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person set free<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					but without effort?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk,<br/>
					aloof from sense-desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil conditions,<br/>
					enters upon the first musing,<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the calming down<br/>
					of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					enters upon the second musing,<br/>
					that calming of the inner self,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of mind<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					disinterested,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					experiences in his own person<br/>
					that ease of which the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He who is disinterested and alert dwells at ease."</p>

					<p class="f4">So he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br/>
					by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br/>
					he attains the fourth musing,<br/>
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br/>
					an equanimity of utter purity,<br/>
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives dependent<br/>
					on these five powers of a pupil:<br/>
					the power of faith,<br/>
					the power of modesty,<br/>
					that of self-restraint,<br/>
					that of energy,<br/>
					and the power of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him these five controlling faculties are manifested in abundance,<br/>

					the controlling faculty of faith,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus by the preponderance of these five controlling faculties<br/>
					he is set free in this very life<br/>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>

					when body breaks up?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But in him these five <span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span>  controlling faculties<br/>

					to wit:<br/>
					the controlling faculty of faith,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the dullness of these five faculties,<br/>
					it is not till body breaks up<br/>
					that he is set free without effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Sa-sankhāra-parinibbāyī.</i> At <i>Dial.</i> iii, 227, 'with some toil.' At <i>PuggA.</i> on <i>Pugg.</i> 17 expl. as <i>dukkhena, kasirena, adhimatta-payogaṃ hatvā</i> (with considerable effort). But at <i>Buddh. Psych. Ethics</i>, § 146, <i>n.</i> 1, explained as instigated. Generally, we may see that immediacy, absence of immediacy is meant. <i>Cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> v, 57; <i>Expos.</i> i, 207: 'the import is <i>with external plan, effort, instigation, expedient, totality of causes.</i>' <i>Comy.</i> on <i>S.</i> v <i>loc. cit.</i> has <i>sappayogena</i> as at <i>VM.</i> ii, 710, where Prof. Mating Tin trans. (<i>Path of Purity</i>, iii, 874): 'Enters complete nirvana with external instigation.'<br/>
					As to <i>parinibbāyin,</i> <i>SA.</i> i, 20, 37 defs. 'gone out by the going out of the impurities.' <i>Comy.</i> on our text expands the textual explanation, saying that these grades are a matter of strength of the controlling faculties, but does not explain <i>parinibbāyin.</i></p>
