					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Ānanda addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sirs."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence," replied those monks to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Ānanda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, when anyone,<br/>
					be it monk or nun,<br/>
					proclaims in my presence<br/>
					that he has attained arahantship,<br/>
					all such do so by virtue of four factors<br/>
					or one of these four.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are they?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, your reverences,<br/>
					a monk develops insight<br/>
					preceded by calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him thus developing insight<br/>
					preceded by calm<br/>
					is born the Way.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He follows along that Way,<br/>
					makes it grow,<br/>
					makes much of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him following,<br/>
					developing,<br/>
					making much of that Way,<br/>
					the fetters are abandoned,<br/>
					the lurking tendencies<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> come to an end.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or again, your reverences,<br/>
					a monk develops calm<br/>
					preceded by insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him developing calm<br/>
					preceded by insight<br/>
					is born the Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">He follows along that Way,<br/>
					makes it grow,<br/>
					makes much of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him following,<br/>
					developing,<br/>
					making much of that Way,<br/>
					the fetters are abandoned,<br/>
					the lurking tendencies come to an end.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again, your reverences,<br/>
					a monk develops calm-and- <span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span> insight coupled.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"> In him thus developing calm-and-insight coupled<br/>
					the Way is born.</p>

					<p class="f4">He follows along that Way,<br/>
					makes it grow,<br/>
					makes much of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him following,<br/>
					developing,<br/>
					making much of that Way,<br/>
					the fetters are abandoned,<br/>
					the lurking tendencies come to an end.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, your reverences,<br/>
					a monk's mind<br/>
					is utterly cleared of perplexities about Dhamma.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That is the time, your reverences,<br/>
					when his thought<br/>
					stands fixed in the very self,<br/>
					settles down,<br/>
					becomes one-pointed,<br/>
					is composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him the Way is born.</p>

					<p class="f4">He follows along that Way,<br/>
					makes it grow,<br/>
					makes much of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him following,<br/>
					developing,<br/>
					making much of that Way,<br/>
					the fetters are abandoned,<br/>
					the lurking tendencies come to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, your reverences,<br/>
					when anyone,<br/>
					be it monk or nun,<br/>
					proclaims in my presence<br/>
					that he has attained arahantship,<br/>
					all such do so by virtue of four factors<br/>
					or one of these four.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Here our text reads <i>dhamm'uddhacca-vigahītamanā, (?) hoti.
