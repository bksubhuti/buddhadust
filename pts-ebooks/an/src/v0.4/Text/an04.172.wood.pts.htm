					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[165]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four ways of getting personality.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, monks, the getting of personality<br/>
					in the getting of which<br/>
					one's own intention,<br/>
					not that of another person,<br/>
					has effect.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is that in the getting of which<br/>
					another person's intention<br/>
					has effect,<br/>
					not one's own.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is that in which both one's own<br/>
					and another's intention<br/>
					have effect.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is that in which neither<br/>
					has effect.</p>

					<p class="f4">These make four."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said,<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta said this<br/>
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of this, lord, that has been uttered by the Exalted One in brief<br/>
					I understand the meaning in detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case where there is getting of personality<br/>
					in which one's own intention,<br/>
					not another's,<br/>
					has effect,<br/>
					there is decease for those beings<br/>
					from that group<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					because of one's own intention.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case where there is getting of personality<br/>
					in which another's intention,<br/>
					not one's own,<br/>
					has effect,<br/>
					there is decease for those beings<br/>
					from that group<br/>
					because of another's intention.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In the case where there is getting of personality<br/>
					in which both have effect,<br/>
					there is decease for those beings<br/>
					from that group<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					because of the intention<br/>
					both of oneself<br/>
					and of another.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But, lord, in the case<br/>
					where there is getting of personality<br/>
					in <span class="f2 g"><b>[166]</b></span> which neither has effect,<br/>
					what sort of devas are to be regarded therein?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Sāriputta,<br/>
					it is the devas who have attained the realm<br/>
					in which is neither-perception-nor-non-perception.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, lord, what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why certain beings<br/>
					deceasing from that group<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					are Returners,<br/>
					who come back to this state of things?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why certain beings<br/>
					deceasing from that group<br/>
					are Non-returners,<br/>
					who come not back to this state of things?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this (first) case, Sāriputta,<br/>
					in a certain person<br/>
					the fetters that bind to this world<br/>
					are not abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one<br/>
					in this very life<br/>
					attains the realm where there is neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys its sweetness,<br/>
					longs for it,<br/>
					finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>
					given thereto,<br/>
					generally spending his time therein,<br/>
					not falling away therefrom,<br/>
					when he makes an end<br/>
					he is reborn in that company.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he deceases thence<br/>
					he is a Returner,<br/>
					he comes back to this state of things.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In the other case, Sāriputta,<br/>
					in a certain person<br/>
					the fetters that bind to this world<br/>
					are abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one<br/>
					in this very life<br/>
					attains the realm where is neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys its sweetness,<br/>
					longs for it,<br/>
					finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>
					given thereto,<br/>
					generally spending his time therein,<br/>
					not falling away therefrom,<br/>
					when he makes an end he is reborn<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> in that company,<br/>
					but deceasing thence<br/>
					he is a Non-returner,<br/>
					he comes not back to this state of things.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the reason,<br/>
					this is the cause, Sāriputta,<br/>
					why certain beings are Non-returners,<br/>
					who come not back to this state of things."</p>
