					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The four branches of analytical knowledge - viz., of meanings <i>(attha),</i> of conditions <i>(dhammā),</i> of definitions <i>(nirutti),</i> of intellect <i>(paṭibhāna).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Odhiso</i> (and <i>vyañjanaso</i>); the former word (limit) means 'within bounds,' 'limited to a particular sense.' <i>Anodhiso</i> = 'speaking generally.' <i>Cf.</i> <i>UdA.</i> 214 <i>(eka-vacanena).</i> Here <i>Comy.</i> expl. both as <i>kāra-naso</i> and <i>akkharaso.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>So maṃ pañhena, ahaṃ veyyākaraṇena.</i> (There is no verb here. <i>Comy.</i> supplies <i>upagacchatu</i> and <i>cittaṃ āradhessāmi.</i>) <i>Cf.</i> the similar forcible ellipse at <i>S.</i> iii, 108, <i>Ahaṃ ovādena. Ahayṃ anuggahena. Ahaṃ anusāsaniyā,</i> said to Tissa. Here <i>Comy.</i> supplies a verb, <i>uggṇanhāmi.</i> I think it highly probable, as Mrs. Rhys Davids suggests (<i>Sakya,</i> 336-7), that this idiom has the meaning of 'What is the use of when ...?'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Dhammānaṃ sukusalo.</i> This is like the often repeated phrase, <i>Bhagavammūlakā no dhamma.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> ii, 24, 80, 198, etc. <i>Comy.</i> here supposes the Master to be present and to have requested S. to instruct the company.</p>
