					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Upavaṇa came to visit the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Sāriputta, your reverence,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Not in this case, your reverence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, your reverence,<br/>
					is there any end-maker by conduct?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not in this case, your reverence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, your reverence,<br/>
					is there any end-maker by knowledge-and-conduct?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not in this case, your reverence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, then, your reverence,<br/>
					is there any end-maker<br/>
					by any other way<br/>
					than knowledge-and-conduct?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not in this case, your reverence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sāriputta, your reverence, when asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there any end-maker by knowledge'</p>

					<p class="f4">You reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not in this case, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, your reverence,<br/>

					<p class="f4">You reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not in this case, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In what way then, your reverence,<br/>
					is there an end-maker?</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If, your reverence,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If, your reverence,<br/>
					there were an end-maker by knowledge-and-conduct,<br/>
					he would still be an end-maker with grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, your reverence,<br/>
					there were an end-maker<br/>
					by any other way<br/>
					than by knowledge-and-conduct,<br/>
					then the ordinary man<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> would be an end-maker.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, your reverence,<br/>
					the ordinary man,<br/>
					living apart from knowledge-and-conduct,<br/>
					being unversed in conduct,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So knowing,<br/>
