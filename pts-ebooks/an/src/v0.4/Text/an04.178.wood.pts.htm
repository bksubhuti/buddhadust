					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk having attained to<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> some peaceful way of heart's release abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br/>
					to the ending of the person-pack,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					but as he does so<br/>
					his heart leaps not up,<br/>
					does not settle down,<br/>
					does not stay fixed<br/>
					in the <span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span> ending of the person-pack;<br/>
					it is not released therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">For such a monk<br/>
					this ending of the person-pack<br/>
					is not to be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, monks,<br/>
					a man were to seize a branch<br/>
					with his hand smeared with resin;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> that hand of his<br/>
					would cleave to<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> it,<br/>
					grip it,<br/>
					would be held fast; -<br/>
					even so, monks, when a monk has attained<br/>
					to some peaceful way of heart's release<br/>
					he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br/>
					to the ending of the person-pack,<br/>
					but as he does so<br/>
					his heart leaps not up,<br/>
					does not settle down,<br/>
					does not stay fixed in<br/>
					the ending of the person-pack;<br/>
					it is not released therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">For such a monk<br/>
					the ending of the person-pack<br/>
					is not to be looked for.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But in this case<br/>
					suppose a monk has attained<br/>
					to some peaceful way of heart's release<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br/>
					to the ending of the person-pack,<br/>
					his heart leaps up<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> thereto,<br/>
					settles down therein,<br/>
					stays fixed in the ending thereof;<br/>
					it is released therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">For such a monk as this<br/>
					the ending of the person-pack<br/>
					is to be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, monks,<br/>
					a man were to seize a branch<br/>
					with a clean hand,<br/>
					that hand of his<br/>
					would not cleave to it,<br/>
					would not grip it,<br/>
					would not be held fast, -<br/>
					even so, monks, when a monk has attained<br/>
					to some peaceful way of heart's release<br/>
					and abides therein,<br/>
					he gives work of mind<br/>
					to the ending of the person-pack,<br/>
					his heart leaps up thereto,<br/>

					<p class="f4">For such a monk as this<br/>
					the ending of the person-pack<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks,<br/>
					suppose a monk attains<br/>
					to some peaceful way of the heart's release<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br/>
					to the breaking up of ignorance,<br/>
					but as he does so<br/>
					his heart leaps not up thereto,<br/>
					settles not down therein,<br/>
					stays not fixed therein,<br/>
					is not released therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">For such a monk<br/>
					this breaking up of ignorance<br/>
					is not to be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, there is a village pond<br/>
					that has stood for <span class="f2 g"><b>[173]</b></span> countless years,<br/>
					and a man blocks up all its inlets<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					and opens up all outlets,<br/>
					and the sky rains not down steadily,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					then for that village pond<br/>
					no breach of dyke<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> is to be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks,<br/>
					when a monk has attained<br/>
					to some peaceful way of heart's release<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br/>
					to the breaking up of ignorance,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But in this case<br/>

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br/>
					to the breaking up of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">His heart leaps up thereto,<br/>

					<p class="f4">For such a monk<br/>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, there is a village pond<br/>
					that has stood for countless years,<br/>
					and a man opens up all its inlets<br/>

					and the sky rains down steadily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for that village pond<br/>
					a breach of dyke is to be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks,<br/>
					when a monk attains<br/>
					to some peaceful way of heart's release,<br/>

					<p class="f4">For such a monk<br/>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four persons<br/>
