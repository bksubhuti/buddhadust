					<p class="f4">"Pray, Sāriputta, your reverence, what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why certain beings in this world<br/>
					are not fully set free<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span> "In this matter, Ānanda, your reverence,<br/>
