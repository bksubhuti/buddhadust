					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying in Bhoganagara<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> at the Ānanda Shrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you these four great authorities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Carefully give your minds to it and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span> 'And what, monks, are the four great authorities?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a monk might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Face to face with the Exalted One, your reverence,<br/>
					did I hear it;<br/>
					face to face with him<br/>
					did I receive it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Dhamma,<br/>
					this is Vinaya,<br/>
					this is the Master's teaching.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the words of that monk<br/>
					are neither to be welcomed nor scorned,<br/>
					but without welcoming,<br/>
					without scorning,<br/>
					the words and syllables thereof<br/>
					are to be closely scrutinized,<br/>
					laid beside Sutta<br/>
					and compared with Vinaya.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If, when thus laid beside Sutta<br/>
					and compared with Vinaya,<br/>
					they lie not along with Sutta<br/>
					and agree not with Vinaya,<br/>
					to this conclusion must ye come:</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely this is not the word of that Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					the Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					and it was wrongly taken by that monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">So reject it, monks.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again a monk might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Face to face with the Exalted One, your reverence,<br/>
					did I hear it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Face to face with him did I receive it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Dhamma,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now the words of that monk<br/>

					the words and syllables thereof<br/>

					laid beside Sutta<br/>
					and compared with Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, when thus laid beside Sutta<br/>
					and compared with Vinaya,<br/>
					they lie along with Sutta<br/>
					and agree with Vinaya,<br/>
					to this conclusion must ye come:</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely this is the word of that Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					the Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					and it was rightly taken by that monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then bear this in mind as the first great authority.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again a monk might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In such and such a dwelling-place<br/>
					resides an Order (of monks)<br/>
					together with an elder monk,<br/>
					a leader.</p>

					<p class="f4">Face to face with that Order<br/>

					Arahant,<br/>
					the Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					and it was wrongly taken by that Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">So reject it, monks.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But, on the other hand, a monk might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In such and such a dwelling-place<br/>
					resides an Order (of monks)<br/>
					together with an elder monk,<br/>
					a leader.</p>

					<p class="f4">Face to face with that Order<br/>

					face to face<br/>
					I received it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Dhamma,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now the words of that monk<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again a monk might say:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> There were evidently only two collections (baskets or piṭakas). <i>Comy.</i> as at <i>DA.</i> ii, 566 attempts to prove that here <i>Sutta = Suttanta-Abhidhamma-Piṭakāni.</i> But <i>Abhidhamma</i> is obviously a much later collection.
