					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>
					a fighting-man is worthy of a rajah,<br/>
					is a possession of a rajah,<br/>
					is reckoned an attribute of a rajah.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a fighting-man is skilled in points of vantage,<br/>
					he is a far-shooter,<br/>
					a shooter like lightning<br/>
					and a piercer<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> of a huge object.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br/>
					a fighting-man is worthy of a rajah,<br/>
					is a possession of a rajah,<br/>
					is reckoned an attribute of a rajah.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks,<br/>
					possessed of four qualities<br/>
					a monk is worthy of respect,<br/>
					of offerings and gifts,<br/>
					of being saluted with clasped hands upraised,<br/>
					a field of merit<br/>
					unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span> In this case a monk is skilled in points of vantage,<br/>
					he is a far-shooter,<br/>
					a shooter like lightning<br/>
					and a piercer of a huge object.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in what way is a monk skilled in points of vantage?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					he dwells restrained<br/>
					with the restraint of the Obligations;<br/>
					perfect in the practice of right conduct<br/>
					he sees danger in the slightest faults;<br/>
					he takes up<br/>
					and trains himself<br/>
					in the rules of morality.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is a monk skilled in points of vantage.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a monk a far-shooter?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein whatsoever object,<br/>

					future<br/>
					or present,<br/>
					of the self or external to the self,<br/>
					gross or subtle,<br/>
					mean or exalted,<br/>
					far or near, -<br/>
					every object in short that he beholds,<br/>
					he looks upon it,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					with right wisdom,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not of me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not this am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not for me is this the self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not of me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not this am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not for me is this the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk is a far-shooter.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk a shooter like lightning?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk understands as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice going to the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is he a shooter like lightning.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk a piercer of a huge object?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk pierces through the huge mass of nescience.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he is a piercer of a huge object.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities a monk is worthy of respect,<br/>
					of offerings and gifts,<br/>
					of being saluted with clasped hands upraised,<br/>
					a field of merit<br/>
