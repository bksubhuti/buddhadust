					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, in Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Vassakāra,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> a great official of Magadha, came to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the brahmin Vassakāra,<br/>
					a great official of Magadha,<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For my part, master Gotama,<br/>
					I say this,<br/>
					I hold this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">If any man speaks of what he has seen,<br/>
					there is no harm in his saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus I saw."</p>

					<p class="f4">If any man speaks of what he has heard,<br/>
					there is no harm in his saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus I heard."</p>

					<p class="f4">If any man speaks of what he has sensed,<br/>
					of what he has understood, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus I sensed,<br/>
					thus I understood,"</p>

					<p class="f4">there is no harm resulting from that.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, for my part, brahmin,<br/>
					do not say that all that one has <span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span> seen<br/>
					should be spoken of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet do I not say, brahmin,<br/>
					that all that one has seen<br/>
					should not be spoken of.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, for my part, brahmin,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brahmin, in so far as to him<br/>
					who speaks what he has seen<br/>
					unprofitable states wax<br/>
					and profitable states wane,<br/>
					I say that such a thing if seen<br/>
					should not be spoken of.</p>

					<p class="f4">But brahmin, in so far as to him<br/>
					who speaks what he has seen<br/>
					unprofitable states wane<br/>
					and profitable states wax,<br/>
					in one who speaks thereof<br/>
					I say that such things should be spoken of.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In so far as to him<br/>
					who speaks what he has heard,<br/>
					unprofitable states wax<br/>

					I say that such a thing if seen<br/>
					should not be spoken of.</p>

					<p class="f4">But brahmin, in so far as to him<br/>
					who speaks what he has heard<br/>
					unprofitable states wane<br/>
					and profitable states wax,<br/>
					in one who speaks thereof<br/>

					<p class="f4">In so far as to him<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the brahmin Vassakāra,<br/>
					the great official of Magadha,<br/>
					welcomed what was said by the Exalted One,<br/>
					and returning thanks<br/>
					he rose from his seat and went away.</p>
