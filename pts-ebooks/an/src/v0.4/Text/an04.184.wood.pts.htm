					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahmin Jāṇussonī<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came to visit the Exalted One<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously<br/>
					and having greeted him courteously,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the brahmin Jāṇussonī<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For my part, Master Gotama,<br/>
					I say this,<br/>
					I hold this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no one subject to death but fears,<br/>
					falls a-trembling<br/>
					at the thought of death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, brahmin, there is such an one.</p>

					<p class="f4">But there is also one subject to death<br/>
					who does not fear,<br/>
					who does not fall a-trembling<br/>
					at the thought of death.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort is that one<br/>
					who being subject to death<br/>
					fears and falls a-trembling<br/>
					at the thought of death?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, brahmin, a certain one<br/>
					is not freed from passions,<br/>
					not freed from lusts,<br/>
					not freed from desire,<br/>
					affection,<br/>
					from thirst and fever,<br/>
					not freed from craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a grievous sickness afflicts such an one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus afflicted by grievous sickness<br/>
					it occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Alas! the passions that I love<br/>
					will <span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span> leave me,<br/>
					or I shall leave<br/>
					the passions that I love.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon he grieves and wails,<br/>
					laments<br/>
					and beats the breast<br/>
					and falls into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, brahmin, being subject to death,<br/>
					is afraid,<br/>
					he falls a-trembling<br/>
					at the thought of death.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, brahmin, here a certain one<br/>
					who as regards body<br/>
					is not freed from lusts,<br/>
					not freed from desire,<br/>
					affection,<br/>
					from thirst and fever,<br/>
					not freed from craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a grievous sickness afflicts such an one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus afflicted by grievous sickness<br/>
					it occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Alas! the passions that I love<br/>

					<p class="f4">Yet again, brahmin, here a certain one<br/>
					has done no lovely deed,<br/>
					has done no profitable deed,<br/>
					has given no shelter to the timid;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					he has done evil,<br/>
					cruel,<br/>
					wrongful deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a grievous sickness afflicts such an one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus afflicted by grievous sickness<br/>
					it occurs to him:</p>

					he has done evil,<br/>

					<p class="f4">To the doom<br/>

					have done no profitable deed,<br/>
					have given no shelter to the timid;<br/>
					have done evil,<br/>
					cruel,<br/>
					wrongful deeds<br/>
					hereafter I am going.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon he grieves and wails,<br/>
					laments<br/>
					and beats the breast<br/>
					and falls into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, brahmin, being subject to death,<br/>
					is afraid,<br/>
					he falls a-trembling.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again, brahmin, here a certain one<br/>
					is doubtful,<br/>
					full of perplexity,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					has come to no conclusion<span class="f3"><sup>4</sup></span> as to true dhamma.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon he grieves and wails,<br/>
					laments<br/>
					and beats the breast<br/>
					and falls into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one also, being subject to death,<br/>
					is afraid,<br/>
					he falls a-trembling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus these four, being subject to death,<br/>
					are afraid,<br/>
					fall a-trembling.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, brahmin, is he who,<br/>
