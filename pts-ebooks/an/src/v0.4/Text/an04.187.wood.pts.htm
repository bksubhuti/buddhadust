					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha in Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Vassakāra,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					a great official of Magadha,<br/>
					came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him greeted him courteously.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having greeted him courteously<br/>
					he took a seek to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					the <span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span> brahmin Vassakāra,<br/>
					a great official of Magadha<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, master Gotama,<br/>
					could a bad man<br/>
					recognize a bad man<br/>
					(so as to say):</p>

					<p class="f4">"This worthy is a bad man"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is out of place, brahmin;<br/>
					it is an impossibility<br/>

					<p class="f4">'It is out of place, brahmin;<br/>

					<p class="f4">'That, brahmin, is a likely thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is possible for a good man<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Again, master Gotama,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"This worthy is a bad man"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That again, brahmin, is a likely thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, master Gotama,<br/>
					how well said is this<br/>
					by the worshipful Gotama, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is out of place, brahmin;<br/>
					it is an impossibility<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br/>
					on a certain occasion<br/>
					the company of the brāhmin Todeyya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">"A fool is the rajah Eḷeyya<br/>
					to be pleased with Rāma's son, the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why! he even went so far<br/>

					rising up in his presence,<br/>
					putting his hands together<br/>
					and doing homage to him.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover the retinue of the rājah Eḷeyya,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span> such as Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindaki, Gandhabba and Aggivessa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					are fools to be pleased with Rama's son, the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">They too went so far<br/>

					rising up in his presence,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, brahmin, you see<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think those worthies:</p>

					he is superior," -</p>

					<p class="f4">Do they think that?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'They do, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">They think:</p>

					in deciding matters of dispute<br/>
