					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha on Vultures' Peak Hill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Upaka, son of Maṇḍika,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Upaka, son of Maṇḍika, said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'As for me, sir, I say this,<br/>
					I hold this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever starts abusive talk about another<br/>
					and carries it on,<br/>
					but cannot in every way make good his case,<br/>
					in failing to do so<br/>
					should be held blameworthy<br/>
					and guilty of offence.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, Upaka, if he does so<br/>
					he is to be held blameworthy<br/>
					and guilty of offence.</p>

					<p class="f4">You yourself also,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Upaka,<br/>
					start abusive talk about another<br/>
					and carry it on.</p>

					<p class="f4">So doing<br/>
					and failing to make good your case,<br/>
					you are to be held blameworthy<br/>
					and guilty of offence.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">'There, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just like a man catching (his prey) with a big noose<br/>
					as soon as it puts its head out,<br/>
					even so am I caught by the Exalted One<br/>
					with the big noose of words<br/>
					as soon as I open my mouth!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span> 'Upaka, I have pointed out:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This thing is wrong,"</p>

					<p class="f4">and that too in endless variation of word,<br/>
					syllable<br/>
					and Dhamma-teaching of a Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So also, Upaka, have I pointed out:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This thing is right,"</p>

					<p class="f4">and that too in endless variations of word,<br/>
					syllable<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					and Dhamma-teaching of a Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Upaka, I have pointed out:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This thing is right,"</p>

					<p class="f4">and</p>

					<p class="f4">"This thing that is right<br/>
					must be made to grow."</p>

					<p class="f4">This thing that is right, Upaka,<br/>
					must be made to grow.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Upaka, son of Maṇḍika, was pleased with the words of the Exalted One,<br/>
					and after thanking him<br/>
					rose up from his seat and,<br/>
					saluting the Exalted One by keeping his right side towards him,<br/>
					went away to the rajah of Magadha, Ajātasattu, son of the Videhan.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br/>
					he related all the talk he had had with the Exalted One<br/>
					from beginning to end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the rajah of Magadha, Ajātasattu, son of the Videhan,<br/>
					was angry<br/>
					and in his displeasure exclaimed to Upaka, son of Maṇḍika:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What a pestilent fellow<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					is this salt-worker's boy!</p>

					<p class="f4">A scurrilous shameless rogue!</p>

					<p class="f4">To think that he should presume to revile that Exalted One,<br/>
					the Arahant,<br/>
					the Fully Enlightened One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Away with you, Upaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me see you no more!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>
