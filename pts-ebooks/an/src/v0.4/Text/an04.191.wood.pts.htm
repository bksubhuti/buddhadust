					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, four advantages are to be looked for<br/>
					from the frequent verbal practice<br/>
					of teachings heard with the ear,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					from considering them in the mind,<br/>
					from thoroughly penetrating them by view.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākarana, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhu-tadhamma</i> and <i>Vedalla.</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Those teachings heard with the ear,<br/>
					often practised verbally,<br/>
					considered by the mind,<br/>
					are thoroughly penetrated by view.</p>

					<p class="f4">He making an end<br/>
					with <span class="f2 g"><b>[194]</b></span> memory confused<br/>
					is reborn in a certain company of devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the happy ones<br/>
					recite to him Dhamma-verses.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Slow to arise in him, monks,<br/>
					is memory,<br/>
					but that being very quickly reaches excellence.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first advantage to be looked for<br/>
					from the frequent verbal practice<br/>
					of teachings heard with the ear,<br/>
					from considering them by the mind,<br/>
					from thoroughly penetrating them by view.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, a monk masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākarana, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhu-tadhamma</i> and <i>Vedalla.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Those teachings heard with the ear,<br/>

					is reborn in a certain company of devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">There indeed the happy ones<br/>
					recite not to him Dhamma-verses,<br/>
					but maybe some monk who has more-power,<br/>
					one who has won mastery of mind,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					is teaching Dhamma to a company of devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, this is just<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> the Dhamma-discipline<br/>
					according to which<br/>
					formerly I practised the God-life!</p>

					<p class="f4">Slow to arise, monks, in him<br/>
					is memory,<br/>
					but that being very quickly reaches excellence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man<br/>
					skilled in the sound of drums,<br/>
					while going along the high road,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					should hear the sound of a drum.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would have no doubt or uncertainty<br/>
