					<p class="f4">'Monks, these four conditions are to be understood by other four conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is by association<br/>
					that one's virtue is to be understood,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and that too after a long time, not casually;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					by close attention, not by inattention;<br/>
					by a wise man, not by one weak in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is by living with him<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					that a man's integrity is to be understood,<br/>
					and that too after a long time, not casually;<br/>
					by close attention, not by inattention;<br/>
					by a wise man, not by one weak in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is in time of distress<br/>
					that a man's courage is to be understood,<br/>
					and that too after a long time, not casually;<br/>
					by close attention, not by inattention;<br/>
					by a wise man, not by one weak in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is by converse with him<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					that a man's wisdom is to be understood,<br/>
					and that too after a long time, not casually;<br/>
					by close attention, not by inattention;<br/>
					by a wise man, not by one weak in wisdom.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is by association that one's virtue is to be understood,<br/>
					and that too after a long time, not casually;<br/>
					by close attention, not by inattention;<br/>
					by a wise man, not by one weak in wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to what did I say thus?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span> In this case, monks, a person knows thus of another person by associating with him:</p>

					<p class="f4">For a long time this worthy has been one whose deeds are incongruous,<br/>
					inconsistent,<br/>
					shady and spotted.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">His deeds are not consistent,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This worthy is immoral,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, by associating with him one knows thus of another person:</p>

					<p class="f4">For a long time this worthy has been one whose deeds are congruous,<br/>
					consistent,<br/>
					not shady,<br/>
					not spotted.</p>

					<p class="f4">His deeds are consistent,<br/>
					his habits are consistent with morals.</p>

					<p class="f4">This worthy is moral,<br/>
					he is virtuous.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, monks, it is by association that one's virtue is to be understood,<br/>
					and that too after a long time, not casually;<br/>
					by close attention, not by inattention;<br/>
					by a wise man, not by one weak in wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">What is said thus was owing to this.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is by living with him that a man's integrity<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> is to be understood,<br/>
					and that too after a long time, not casually;<br/>
					by close attention, not by inattention;<br/>
					by a wise man, not by one weak in wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to what did I say this?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a person knows thus of another person by living with him:</p>

					<p class="f4">This worthy, when with one person, behaves in one way;<br/>
					when with two persons, in another way;<br/>

					he departs from his latter behaviour.</p>

					<p class="f4">This worthy is not honest in his behaviour.</p>

					<p class="f4">This worthy is dishonest.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case again, monks, a person knows another by living with him:</p>

					<p class="f4">This worthy when with one person behaves just as he does with two,<br/>
					three<br/>
					or many.</p>

					<p class="f4">In his former behaviour<br/>
					he departs not from his latter behaviour.</p>

					<p class="f4">This worthy is honest,<br/>
					he is not dishonest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, monks, it is by living with him that a man's integrity is to be understood,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What is said thus was owing to this.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is in time of distress that a man's courage<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> is to be understood,<br/>
					and that too after a long time, not casually;<br/>
					by close attention, not by inattention;<br/>
					by a wise man, not by one weak in wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to what did I say this?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span> In this case, monks, a certain one, afflicted by the loss of relatives or loss of wealth or by the misfortune of sickness, thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily thus-come-to-be is this living in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus-come-to-be is the getting of a personality.</p>

					<p class="f4">According to this coming-to-be of living in the world<br/>

					eight world-conditions keep the world a-rolling<br/>

					to wit: -<br/>
					gain and loss,<br/>
					disrepute and fame,<br/>
					blame and praise,<br/>
					happiness and unhappiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he, afflicted by loss of relatives,<br/>
					loss of wealth<br/>
					or the misfortune of sickness,<br/>
					sorrows,<br/>
					laments,<br/>
					is distressed<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But in this case, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He, afflicted by the loss of relatives,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Owing to that did I say this.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to what did I say this?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a person by conversing with another knows thus of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Judging by this worthy approach to a question,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

					he is weak in wisdom,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case in question this worthy utters no profound profitable sentence<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> that calms,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This worthy is weak in wisdom,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So I said, and that is why I said it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, these four conditions are to be understood by these other four conditions.'</p>
