					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying among the Koliyans, -<br/>
					there is a place called Sāpūga, -<br/>
					in a township of the Koliyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great number of the Sāpūgyans of the Koliyan clan<br/>
					came to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span> As they sat thus<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said this<br/>
					to the Koliyans of Sāpūga:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Men of the Leopard's Path,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					these four factors of exertion<br/>
					for utter purification<br/>
					have been fully proclaimed<br/>
					by that Exalted One who knows,<br/>
					who sees,<br/>
					that Arahant,<br/>
					the Fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					for the purification of beings,<br/>
					for the passing over grief and distress,<br/>
					for the making an end<br/>
					of sorrow and lamentation,<br/>
					for the winning of the Method,<br/>
					for the realization of Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The factor of exertion<br/>
					for the utter purification of morals,<br/>
					the factor of exertion<br/>
					for the utter purity of thought,<br/>
					the factor of exertion<br/>
					for the utter purity of view,<br/>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is virtuous,<br/>
					he undertakes and practises the precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>

					<p class="f4">And what, men of the Leopard's Path,<br/>
					is the factor of exertion<br/>
					for the utter purification of thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk,<br/>
					aloof from sense-desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil conditions,<br/>
					enters upon the first musing,<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span> Then by the calming down<br/>
					of thought directed and sustained<br/>
					he attains and abides in the second musing,<br/>
					that inward calming,<br/>
					that single-mindedness<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					disinterested,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					he experiences with body<br/>
					that ease<br/>
					of which the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He who is disinterested and alert,<br/>
					dwells at ease,"</p>

					<p class="f4">and he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br/>
					by the ending of both the happiness and unhappiness he had before,<br/>
					he attains and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br/>
					an equanimity of utter purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					"the utter purification of thought."</p>

					<p class="f4">(the resolve):<br/>

					<p class="f4">And what, men of the Leopard's Path,<br/>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk comes to understand,<br/>

					<p class="f4">In this case the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					who is possessed of this factor of exertion<br/>
					for the utter purification of morals<br/>
					for the utter purification of thought<br/>
					for the utter purification of of view,<br/>
					cleanses his heart of conditions that defile,<br/>
					he releases<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> his heart<br/>
					by means of conditions that release.</p>

					<p class="f4">So doing he attains perfection of release.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					"the utter purification of release."</p>

					<p class="f4">(the resolve):<br/>
					I <span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span> will bring to perfection<br/>
					such a purification of release<br/>
					if it be incomplete,<br/>
					and if complete<br/>
					I will supplement it here and there<br/>

					<p class="f4">the desire to do,<br/>

					is called<br/>
					"a factor of exertion<br/>

					<p class="f4">So, men of the Leopard's Path,<br/>
					these are the four factors of exertion<br/>
