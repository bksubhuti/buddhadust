					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu, in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Vappa the Sakyan,<br/>
					a disciple of the Unclothed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> went to visit Moggallāna the Great,<br/>
					and on coming to him,<br/>
					saluted the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat thus,<br/>
					the venerable Moggallāna the Great was saying this<br/>
					to Vappa the Sakyan,<br/>
					disciple of the Unclothed:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There may be someone here, Vappa,<br/>
					restrained in body,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and thought<br/>
					owing to the waning of ignorance<br/>
					and the arising of knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any cause<br/>
					owing to which the <i><i>āsavas</i></i> causing pain<br/>
					would flow in upon<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> the man at some future time?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, I do see such a reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be in this case<br/>
					a certain previously done evil deed,<br/>
					whose fruit has not yet ripened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to that the <i><i>āsavas</i></i> causing pain might flow in upon that man at some future time.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span> At this juncture the conversation which the two were holding was broken off.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/>
					at eventide rising from his solitary meditating,<br/>
					went towards the service-hall,<br/>
					and on reaching it sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken his seat the Exalted One said this to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, Moggallāna, on what subject are you talking as you sit here now,<br/>
					and what was the talk just interrupted?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, I was just saying to Vappa the Sakyan,<br/>
					disciple of the Unclothed,</p>

					<p class="f4">"There may be someone here, Vappa,<br/>
					restrained in body, speech and thought,<br/>
					owing to the waning of ignorance<br/>
					and the arising of knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any cause owing to which the <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br/>
					would flow in upon the man at some future time?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, lord, Vappa was saying to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, I do see such a reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be in this case a certain previously done evil deed<br/>
					whose fruit has not yet ripened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to that the <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br/>
					might flow in upon that man at some future time."</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the subject we were engaged upon;<br/>
					then the talk was interrupted by the arrival of the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to Vappa the Sakyan,<br/>
					disciple of the Unclothed:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If you, Vappa,<br/>
					would allow what you deem allowable,<br/>
					and reject what you deem should be rejected,<br/>
					and in case you should not understand the meaning of my words,<br/>
					if you would question me still further thus:<br/>
					"How is this, sir?<br/>
					What is the meaning of that?"<br/>
					- we might have a talk here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will indeed, lord,<br/>
					allow the Exalted One what I deem allowable<br/>
					and will reject what I deem should be rejected,<br/>
					and in case I do not understand the Exalted One's words<br/>
					I will question the Exalted One still further, thus:<br/>
					"What is this, lord?<br/>
					What is the meaning of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So be it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let us have a talk here.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what think you, Vappa?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to these <i>āsavas</i> which come about as a result of bodily activities,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					in the case of one who abstains from bodily activities that cause vexation and <span class="f2 g"><b>[209]</b></span> distress,<br/>
					it follows that those <i><i>āsavas</i></i> causing pain do not exist in him.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He does no fresh deed;<br/>
					as to his former deed,<br/>
					he wears it out by constant contact with it,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					by a wearing out<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					that is plain to see,<br/>
					not just for a time;<br/>
					one that asks for inspection,<br/>
					that leads onward,<br/>
					a wearing out that can be understood by the intelligent,<br/>
					each for himself.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any reason why <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br/>
					should flow in upon him at some future time?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, lord, that cannot be.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now again, Vappa, what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to those <i>āsavas</i> that come about as the result of activities of speech<br/>
					in the case of one who abstains from activities of speech that cause vexation and distress,<br/>
					it follows that those <i><i>āsavas</i></i> causing pain do not exist in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does no fresh deed;<br/>
					as to his former deed,<br/>
					he wears it out by constant contact with it,<br/>
					by a wearing out<br/>
					that is plain to see,<br/>
					not just for a time;<br/>
					one that asks for inspection,<br/>
					that leads onward,<br/>
					a wearing out that can be understood by the intelligent,<br/>
					each for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any reason why <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br/>
					should flow in upon him at some future time?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, lord, that cannot be.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now again, Vappa, what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to those <i>āsavas</i> that come about as the result of activities of mind,<br/>
					in the case of one who abstains from activities of mind that cause vexation and distress,<br/>
					it follows that those <i><i>āsavas</i></i> causing pain do not exist in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does no fresh deed;<br/>
					as to his former deed,<br/>
					he wears it out by constant contact with it,<br/>
					by a wearing out<br/>
					that is plain to see,<br/>
					not just for a time;<br/>
					one that asks for inspection,<br/>
					that leads onward,<br/>
					a wearing out that can be understood by the intelligent,<br/>
					each for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any reason why <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br/>
					should flow in upon him at some future time?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, lord, that cannot be.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again what think you, Vappa?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to those <i>āsavas</i> causing vexation and distress which result from ignorance, -<br/>
					owing to the waning of ignorance<br/>
					and the arising of knowledge<br/>
					it follows that those <i>āsavas</i> of vexation and distress<br/>
					do not exist in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does no fresh deed;<br/>
					as to his former deed,<br/>
					he wears it out by constant contact with it,<br/>
					by a wearing out that is plain to see,<br/>
					not just for a time;<br/>
					one that asks for inspection,<br/>
					that leads onward,<br/>
					a wearing out that can be understood by the intelligent each for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any reason why <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br/>
					should flow in upon him at some future time?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, lord, that cannot be.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'So then, Vappa, by the monk whose heart is perfectly <span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span> released<br/>
					six constant abiding-states<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> are attained.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, seeing an object with the eye,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the ear,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Smelling a scent with the nose,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tasting a savour with the tongue,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">With body contacting tangibles,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">With mind cognizing mental states,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">When he feels a feeling limited by body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					he knows that he so feels.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up,<br/>
					after life is used up,<br/>
					all my experiences in this world<br/>
					will lose their lure and grow cold.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Vappa, that a shadow is cast by a stump.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then comes a man with axe and basket<br/>
					and cuts down that stump by the root.</p>

					<p class="f4">So doing he digs all round it.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so he pulls up the roots,<br/>
					even the rootlets and root-fibres.</p>

					<p class="f4">He chops that stump into logs,<br/>
					and having done so chops the log into chips.</p>

					<p class="f4">The chips he dries in wind and sun,<br/>
					then burns them with fire,<br/>
					then makes an ash-heap.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ash-heap he winnows in a strong wind<br/>
					or lets the ash be carried away by a swiftly flowing river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Vappa, that shadow cast because of the stump<br/>
					is cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made not to become again,<br/>
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Vappa,<br/>
					by a monk whose heart is thus released<br/>
					six constant abiding-places are won.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, seeing an object with the eye,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the ear,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Smelling a scent with the nose,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tasting a savour with the tongue,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">With body contacting tangibles,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">With mind cognizing mental states,<br/>
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br/>
					but rests indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he feels a feeling limited <span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span> by body,<br/>
					he knows that he so feels.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up,<br/>
					after life is used up,<br/>
					all my experiences in this world<br/>
					will lose their lure and grow cold.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Vappa, the Sakyan,<br/>
					disciple of the Unclothed,<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, just like a man desirous of wealth<br/>
					who tends his property<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span><br/>
					but gets no increase therefrom,<br/>
					but instead gets toil and trouble for his pains,<br/>
					even so, lord, did I,<br/>
					desirous of profit,<br/>
					do service unto the Unclothed.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I got no profit thereby,<br/>
					but instead got toil and trouble for my pains.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, lord, from this day forth,<br/>
					whatever faith I had in those fools the Unclothed, -<br/>
					I winnow it away in a strong wind,<br/>
					or I let it be carried away by a swiftly flowing river.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, master Gotama,<br/>
					one should raise the fallen<br/>
					or show forth the hidden,<br/>
					or point the way to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br/>
					so that they who have yes may behold objects, —<br/>
					even so in divers ways has dhamma been set forth by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me as his follower from this time forth<br/>
					so long as life shall last,<br/>
					as one who has gone to him for refuge.'</p>
