					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove in Anāthapndika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now <span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span> Mallikā the queen<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As she sat thus<br/>
					Mallikā the queen<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why in this world<br/>
					some women-folk are ill-favoured,<br/>
					deformed,<br/>
					of a mean appearance,<br/>
					and are poor,<br/>
					having little of their own,<br/>
					of small possessions<br/>
					and are of small account?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, pray what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why in this world<br/>
					some women-folk are ill-favoured,<br/>
					deformed,<br/>
					of a mean appearance,<br/>
					but yet are wealthy,<br/>
					of great riches,<br/>
					of great possessions<br/>
					and of great account?</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, pray what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why in this world<br/>
					some women-folk are well-favoured,<br/>
					well-formed,<br/>
					lovely to look upon,<br/>
					amiable,<br/>
					possessed of the greatest beauty of complexion,<br/>
					and yet are poor,<br/>
					having little of their own,<br/>
					of small possessions<br/>
					and are of small account?</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet again, lord, pray what is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why in this world<br/>
					some women-folk are well-favoured,<br/>
					well-formed,<br/>
					lovely to look upon,<br/>
					amiable,<br/>
					possessed of the greatest beauty of complexion,<br/>
					and are moreover wealthy,<br/>
					of great riches,<br/>
					of great possessions<br/>
					and of great account?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, Mallikā, a certain woman<br/>
					is ill-tempered,<br/>
					of a very irritable nature.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On very little provocation<br/>
					she becomes cross and agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is upset and becomes stubborn,<br/>
					she shows temper<br/>
					and ill-will<br/>
					and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is no giver of charity<br/>
					to recluse or brahmin,<br/>
					nor gives food,<br/>
					drink,<br/>
					clothing,<br/>
					vehicle,<br/>
					flower,<br/>
					scent,<br/>
					ointment,<br/>
					bed,<br/>
					lodging<br/>
					or light.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, she is jealous-minded,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					she is jealous of <span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span> other folk's gain,<br/>
					of the honour,<br/>
					respect,<br/>
					reverence,<br/>
					homage<br/>
					and worship paid to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is revengeful<br/>
					and harbours a grudge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, if, deceasing from that life,<br/>
					she comes back to this state of things,<br/>
					wherever she is reborn,<br/>
					is ill-favoured,<br/>
					ill-formed,<br/>
					of a mean appearance<br/>
					and poor,<br/>
					having little of her own,<br/>
					of small possessions,<br/>
					and is of small account.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again (in the second case), Mallikā,<br/>
					a certain woman<br/>
					is ill-tempered,<br/>
					of a very irritable nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">On very little provocation<br/>
					she becomes cross and agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is upset and becomes stubborn,<br/>
					she shows temper<br/>
					and ill-will<br/>
					and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">But she is a giver of charity<br/>
					to recluse or brahmin,<br/>
					she gives food,<br/>
					drink,<br/>
					clothing,<br/>
					vehicle,<br/>
					flower,<br/>
					scent,<br/>
					ointment,<br/>
					bed,<br/>
					lodging<br/>
					or light.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, she is not jealous-minded,<br/>
					she is not jealous<br/>
					of other folk's gain,<br/>
					of the honour,<br/>
					respect,<br/>
					reverence,<br/>
					homage<br/>
					and worship<br/>
					paid to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is not revengeful,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, if, on deceasing from that life,<br/>

					but she is wealthy,<br/>
					of great riches,<br/>
					of great possessions<br/>
					and is of great account.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again (in the third case), Mallikā,<br/>
					a certain woman<br/>
					is not ill-tempered,<br/>
					not of a very irritable nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even on great provocation<br/>
					she becomes not cross<br/>

					<p class="f4">She is not upset,<br/>
					does not become stubborn,<br/>

					ill-will<br/>

					<p class="f4">Yet she is no giver of charity<br/>

					<p class="f4">But she is jealous-minded.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is jealous of other folk's gain,<br/>

					<p class="f4">She is revengeful<br/>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, if, deceasing from that life,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But she is poor,<br/>
					having little of her own,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Herein again (in the fourth case), Mallikā,<br/>
					a certain woman is neither ill-tempered<br/>
					nor of a very irritable nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even on great provocation<br/>
					she becomes not cross and agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">She <span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span> is not upset,<br/>
					does not become stubborn,<br/>
					does not show ill-will<br/>
					and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, she is a giver of charity<br/>
					to recluse and brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">She gives one food,<br/>
					drink,<br/>
					clothing,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, deceasing from that life<br/>

					<p class="f4">She is wealthy,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now, Mallikā, these are the reasons and causes<br/>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br/>
					queen Mallikā said this<br/>
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose, lord, that I<br/>
					in another birth<br/>
					was ill-tempered and of an irritable nature,<br/>
					becoming cross and agitated<br/>
					even on slight provocation;<br/>
					that I became upset thereat and stubborn,<br/>
					showed ill-will and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same I<br/>
					(might now be) ill-favoured,<br/>
					ill-formed<br/>
					and of mean appearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, lord, that in another birth<br/>
					I gave gifts of charity<br/>
					to recluse and brahmin<br/>
					food,<br/>
					drink,<br/>
					clothing,<br/>
					vehicle,<br/>
					flowers,<br/>
					scent,<br/>
					ointment,<br/>
					bed,<br/>
					lodging<br/>
					and light,<br/>
					that same I<br/>
					now might be wealthy,<br/>
					of great riches,<br/>
					of great possessions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, lord, that in another birth<br/>
					I was not jealous-minded,<br/>
					I was not jealous of other folk's gain,<br/>
					nor of the honour,<br/>
					respect,<br/>
					reverence,<br/>
					homage<br/>
					and worship paid to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I was not revengeful<br/>
					nor did I harbour a grudge.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same I<br/>
					am now of great account.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now again, lord, in this rajah's family<br/>
					there are maids of the nobles,<br/>
					maids of the brahmins<br/>
					and of the householders too.</p>

					<p class="f4">Over them I hold supremacy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, from this day forth<br/>
					I will indeed become good-tempered,<br/>
					not irritable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even on great provocation<br/>
					I will not become upset nor stubborn.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will not show ill-will<br/>
					nor displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will give to recluse and brahmin<br/>
					food,<br/>
					drink,<br/>
					clothing,<br/>
					vehicle,<br/>
					flowers,<br/>
					scent,<br/>
					ointment,<br/>
					bed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">I will not become jealous-minded.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will not be jealous of <span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span> other folk's gain,<br/>

					<p class="f4">I will not be revengeful<br/>
					nor will I harbour a grudge.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, lord,<br/>
					one should raise the fallen<br/>
					or show forth the hidden,<br/>
					or point the way<br/>
					to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br/>
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects,-<br/>
					even so in divers ways<br/>
					has dhamma been set forth by the worthy Gotama.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, may the Exalted One accept me<br/>
					as a woman disciple<br/>
