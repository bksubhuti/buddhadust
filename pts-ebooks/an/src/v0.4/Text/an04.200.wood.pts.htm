					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is affection born of affection?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then others treat<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> that one as dear,<br/>
