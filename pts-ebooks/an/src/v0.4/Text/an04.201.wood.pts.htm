					and the still more unworthy man.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you the worthy man<br/>
					and the still more worthy man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it carefully.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your minds and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,'<br/>
					replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
