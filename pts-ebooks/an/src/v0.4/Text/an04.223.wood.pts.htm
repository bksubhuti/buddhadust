					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessing four qualities<br/>
					the foolish,<br/>
					sinful,<br/>
					unworthy man<br/>
					carries about with him<br/>
					an uprooted,<br/>
					lifeless self,<br/>
					is blameworthy,<br/>
					is censured by the intelligent<br/>
					and begets much demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">By bad conduct of body,<br/>
					bad conduct of speech<br/>
					bad conduct of thought,<br/>
					and ingratitude,<br/>
					that is, ungratefulness</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of these four qualities<br/>
