					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four deeds I have myself comprehended,<br/>
					realized<br/>
					and made known.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a dark deed<br/>
					with a dark result;<br/>
					a bright deed<br/>
					with a bright result;<br/>
					a deed that is both dark and bright,<br/>
					with a dark and bright result;<br/>
					and the deed that is neither dark nor bright,<br/>
					with a result neither dark nor bright,<br/>
					which being itself a deed<br/>
					conduces to the waning of deeds.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the deed that is dark,<br/>
					with a dark result?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain one<br/>
					plans planned bodily action<br/>
					joined with harm<br/>
					plans planned action of speech,<br/>
					joined with harm,<br/>
					plans planned action of thought,<br/>
					joined with harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thus planning harmful action of body,<br/>
					planning harmful action of speech<br/>
					planning harmful action of thought,<br/>
					is born into a world that is harmful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus born into a harmful world,<br/>
					harmful contacts contact him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus touched by harmful contacts<br/>
					he feels feeling that is harmful,<br/>
					that is sheer pain,<br/>
					just as do beings in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					"the dark deed with a dark result."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the bright deed<br/>
					with the bright result?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain one<br/>
					plans planned bodily action<br/>
					that is not joined with harm<br/>
					plans planned action of speech,<br/>
					that is not joined with harm,<br/>
					plans planned action of thought,<br/>
					that is not joined with harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thus planning harmless action of body,<br/>
					planning harmless action of speech<br/>
					planning harmless action of thought,<br/>
					is born into a world that is harmless.</p>

					<p class="f4">So born into a harmless world<br/>
					harmless contacts touch him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, thus touched by harmless contacts,<br/>
					experiences feeling that is harmless,<br/>
					utter bliss,<br/>
					such as do the Ever-radiant devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					"the bright deed with a bright result."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the deed that is both dark and bright,<br/>
					with a result that is both dark and bright?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain one<br/>
					plans planned bodily action<br/>
					that is joined with harm and harmlessness,<br/>
					plans planned action of speech,<br/>
					that is joined with harm and harmlessness,<br/>
					plans planned action of thought,<br/>
					that is joined with harm and harmlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thus planning action of body,<br/>
					that is both harmful and harmless<br/>
					planning harmless action of speech<br/>
					that is both harmful and harmless<br/>
					planning harmless action of thought,<br/>
					that is both harmful and harmless<br/>
					is born into a world<br/>
					that is both harmful and harmless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by contacts<br/>
					both harmful and harmless<br/>
					he experiences feeling<br/>
					that is both harmful and harmless,<br/>
					a mixture of pleasure and pain,<br/>
					such as for instance some humans,<br/>
					some devas,<br/>
					and some dwellers in purgatory feel.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					"the deed that is both dark and bright,<br/>
					with a result that is both dark and bright."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the deed that is neither dark nor bright,<br/>
					with a result that is neither dark nor bright,<br/>
					which, itself a deed,<br/>
					conduces to the waning of deeds?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[242]</b></span> The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is dhamma-search,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					"the deed that is neither dark nor bright,<br/>
					with a result that is neither dark nor bright,<br/>
					which, itself a deed,<br/>
					conduces to the waning of deeds."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four deeds I have myself comprehended,<br/>
					realized<br/>
					and made known.</p>
