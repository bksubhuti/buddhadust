					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bodily action that is blameworthy,<br/>
					action of speech that is blameworthy,<br/>
					action of thought that is blameworthy,<br/>
					view that is blameworthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing these four things<br/>
