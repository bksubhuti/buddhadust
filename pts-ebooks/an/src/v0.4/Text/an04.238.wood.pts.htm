					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessing four things<br/>
					one is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bodily action that is harmful,<br/>
					action of speech that is harmful,<br/>
					action of thought that is harmful,<br/>
					view that is harmful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing these four things<br/>
