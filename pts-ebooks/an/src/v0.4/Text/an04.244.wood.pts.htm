					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[249]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four postures.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The posture of petas,<br/>
					that of the luxurious,<br/>
					that of the lion<br/>
					and the posture of the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the posture of petas?</p>

					<p class="f4">Generally petas lie flat on their backs.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is called "the peta-posture."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the posture of the luxurious?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[250]</b></span> Generally the luxurious lie on the left side.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called "the luxurious posture."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the posture of the lion?</p>

					<p class="f4">The lion, monks, the king of beasts, takes up a posture on his right side, laying foot on foot<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> and folding his tail between his thighs.</p>

					<p class="f4">On waking he straightens out the fore part of the body and looks round to the hinder part.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, if the lion, king of beasts,<span class="f3"><sup>5</sup></span> sees any part of his body displaced or disarranged,<span class="f3"><sup>6</sup></span> thereupon, monks, the lion, king of beasts,<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> is displeased.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if the lion, king of beasts, sees no part of his body displaced or disarranged, then he is pleased.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called "the lion-posture."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the Tathāgata-posture?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a monk,<br/>
					aloof from sense-desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil conditions,<br/>
					enters upon the first musing,<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought<br/>
					directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He by the calming down of thought<br/>
					directed and sustained,<br/>
					enters upon the second musing,<br/>
					that calming of the inner self,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of mind<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					disinterested,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					experiences in his own person<br/>
					that ease of which the Ariyans declare:<br/>
					"He who is disinterested and alert<br/>
					dwells at ease,"<br/>
					and thus attains<br/>
					and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br/>
					by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br/>
					attains the fourth musting,<br/>
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br/>
					an equanimity of utter purity<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the Tathāgata-posture.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So there are these four postures.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> says they are too meagre to lie on the side. As it calls petas 'just the dead,' it is possible that the posture of a corpse is thought of.</p>
