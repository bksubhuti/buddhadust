					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four modes of speech are Ariyan.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Speaking of things not seen as not seen,<br/>
					of things not heard as not heard,<br/>
					of things not sensed as not sensed,<br/>
					speaking of things not cognized as not cognized.'</p>
