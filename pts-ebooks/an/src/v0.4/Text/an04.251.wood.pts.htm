					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four states.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are states to be comprehended by higher knowledge,<br/>
					states to be abandoned by higher knowledge,<br/>
					states to be made more of by higher knowledge<br/>
					and states to be realized by higher knowledge.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, are the states<br/>
					to be comprehended by higher knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">The five factors of grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are called<br/>
					"states to be comprehended by higher knowledge."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, are the states<br/>
					to be abandoned by higher knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance and the craving for becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are called<br/>
					"states to be abandoned by higher knowledge."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, are the states<br/>
					to be made more of by higher knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Calm and insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are called<br/>
					"states to be made more of by higher knowledge."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, are the states<br/>
					to be realized by higher knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge and release.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are called<br/>
					"states to be realized by higher knowledge."</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four states.</p>
