					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four un-Ariyan quests.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one,<br/>
					being in himself subject to decay,<br/>
					seeks after that of which the nature is decay.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being in himself subject to disease,<br/>
					he seeks after that of which the nature is death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being in himself subject to death,<br/>
					he seeks after that of which the nature is death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being in himself subject to defilement,<br/>
					he seeks after that of which the nature is defilement.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four un-Ariyan quests.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are these four Ariyan quests.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one,<br/>
					being in himself subject to <span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span> decay,<br/>
					seeing the disadvantage<br/>
					of what is of a nature to decay,<br/>
					seeks after the undecaying,<br/>
					the unsurpassed rest after toil,<br/>
					even Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being in himself subject to disease,<br/>
					seeing the disadvantage<br/>
					in what is of a nature to be diseased,<br/>
					he seeks after the unailing,<br/>
					unsurpassed rest after toil,<br/>
					even Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being in himself subject to death,<br/>
					seeing the disadvantage<br/>
					in what is of a nature to die,<br/>
					he seeks after the deathless,<br/>
					unsurpassed rest after toil,<br/>
					even Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being in himself subject to defilement,<br/>
					seeing the disadvantage<br/>
					in what is of a nature to be defiled,<br/>
					he seeks after the undefiled,<br/>
					unsurpassed rest after toil,<br/>
					even Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four Ariyan quests.'</p>
