					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now the venerable Māluṅkyā's son came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat thus<br/>
					the venerable Māluṅkyā's son said this<br/>
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One<br/>
					would teach me Dhamma in brief!</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing which Dhamma from the Exalted One's lips<br/>
					I could dwell alone,<br/>
					remote,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and resolute.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, Māluṅkyā's son,<br/>
					what am I to teach the young monks,<br/>
					when you,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					a broken-down old man,<br/>
					far-gone in years,<br/>
					beg a teaching in brief<br/>
					of the Tathāgata?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[254]</b></span> 'Nay, lord, let the Exalted One<br/>
					teach me Dhamma in brief!</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely I could understand the meaning<br/>
					of the Exalted One's words!</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely I could become heir<br/>
					to the Exalted One's words!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, Māluṅkyā's son,<br/>
					there are these four ways<br/>
					in which craving arises in a monk<br/>
					when it does arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because of the robe<br/>
					that craving arises in a monk when it does arise;<br/>
					it is because of alms-food,<br/>
					that craving arises in a monk when it does arise;<br/>
					it is because of lodging,<br/>
					that craving arises in a monk when it does arise;<br/>
					it is because of failure or success<br/>
					to become this or that<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					that craving arises in a monk when it does arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Māluṅkyā's son,<br/>
					when craving is abandoned in a monk,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made not to become again,<br/>
					made of a nature not to arise again in future time,<br/>
					this monk is called</p>

					<p class="f4">"One who has cut off craving,<br/>
					broken the bond,<br/>
					by perfect comprehension of conceit<br/>
					has made an end of Ill."'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Māluṅkyā's son,<br/>
					thus instructed by the Exalted One<br/>
					with this instruction,<br/>
					rose from his seat,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and keeping his right side towards him<br/>
					went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Māluṅkyā's son,<br/>
					living solitary,<br/>
					remote,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and resolute,<br/>
					in that very life<br/>
					himself comprehending and realizing<br/>
					that unsurpassed perfection of the holy life,<br/>
					for which clansmen rightly go forth from the home<br/>
					to the homeless,<br/>
					having attained it<br/>
					abode therein,<br/>
					so that he fully comprehended the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">Cut off is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done the thing that should be done,<br/>
					there is no more of this state of things.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Māluṅkyā's son<br/>
					was yet another of the arahants.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
