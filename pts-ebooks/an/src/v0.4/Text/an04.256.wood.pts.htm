					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Possessed of four qualities, monks,<br/>
					a rajah's noble, thoroughbred steed<br/>
					is worthy of the rajah,<br/>
					is the rajah's possession,<br/>
					is reckoned an asset of the rajah.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a rajah's noble, thoroughbred steed<br/>

					strength,<br/>
					speed<br/>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br/>
					possessed of four qualities<br/>
					a monk is worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of hospitality,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>

					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk has beauty (of life),<br/>strength (of character,<br/>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of beauty?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk is virtuous,<br/>

					is proficient in the practice of good conduct,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of strength?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk lives ardent in energy,<br/>
					ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br/>
					to acquire good qualities,<br/>
					strenuously <span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span> exerting himself,<br/>
					not throwing off the burden in good qualities.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of speed?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk understands,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice going to the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way a monk is possessed of speed (of insight).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of good proportions?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk is one<br/>
