					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Possessed of four qualities, monks,<br/>
					a rajah's noble, thoroughbred steed<br/>
					is worthy of the rajah,<br/>
					is the rajah's possession,<br/>
					is reckoned an asset of the rajah.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a rajah's noble, thoroughbred steed<br/>
					is possessed of beauty,<br/>
					strength,<br/>
					speed<br/>
					and good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br/>
					a rajah's noble, thoroughbred steed<br/>
					is worthy of the rajah,<br/>
					is the rajah's possession,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br/>
					possessed of four qualities<br/>
					a monk is worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of hospitality,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					of salutations with clasped hands,<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk has beauty (of life),<br/>strength (of character,<br/>
					speed (of insight)<br/>
					and good proportions (of necessaries).</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of beauty?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					he lives restrained with the restraint of the obligations,<br/>
					is proficient in the practice of good conduct,<br/>
					seeing danger in the slightest faults<br/>
					he trains himself in the precepts<br/>
					by undertaking them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he has beauty (of life).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of strength?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk lives ardent in energy,<br/>
					ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br/>
					to acquire good qualities,<br/>
					strenuously exerting himself,<br/>
					not throwing off the burden in good qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he has strength (of character).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of speed?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk,<br/>
					by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/>
					attains the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by wisdom<br/>
					that ie without the āsavas,<br/>
					in this very life<br/>
					of himself thoroughly comprehending it,<br/>
					and abides therein.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of good proportions?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk is one<br/>
					who gets robe and alms-food,<br/>
					lodging,<br/>
					extras and necessary medicines<br/>
