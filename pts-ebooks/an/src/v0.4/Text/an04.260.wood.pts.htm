					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>
					the foolish,<br/>
					sinful,<br/>
					unworthy man<br/>
					carries about with him<br/>
					a lifeless,<br/>
					uprooted self,<br/>
					is blameworthy,<br/>
					is censured by the intelligent<br/>
					and begets much demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Action of body that is blameworthy,<br/>
					action of speech that is blameworthy, <br/>
					action of thought that is blameworthy,<br/>
					view that is blameworthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four qualities<br/>
					wherein the foolish,<br/>
					sinful,<br/>
					unworthy man<br/>
					carries about with him<br/>
					a lifeless,<br/>
					uprooted self,<br/>
