					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, one possessing four qualities<br/>
					is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He himself takes life<br/>
					and encourages another to do so,<br/>
					approves of taking life<br/>
					and speaks in praise thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing these four qualities<br/>
					one is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Text miscalls this <i>Abhiñña-vagga.</i> There is no <i>uddāna</i> to this vagga, so I give my own titles to the suttas. <i>Cf.</i> § 212. [Ed.: PTS text now uses only 'Vagga' for the title of this vagga. I have used the title of the vagga and the titles of the suttas as found in BJT and on the CSCD.]</p>
