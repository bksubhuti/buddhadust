					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, one possessing four qualities<br/>
					is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He himself steals<br/>
					and encourages another to steal,<br/>
					approves of stealing<br/>
					and speaks in praise of stealing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing these four qualities<br/>
					one is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessing four qualities<br/>
					one is put into heaven<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He himself abstains from stealing,<br/>
					encourages another to such abstinence<br/>
					approves of abstaining from stealing<br/>
					and speaks in praise of abstaining from stealing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing these four qualities<br/>
					one is put into heaven<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>
