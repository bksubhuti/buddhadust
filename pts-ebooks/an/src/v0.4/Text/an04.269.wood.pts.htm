					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, one possessing four qualities<br/>
					is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He himself is malicious minded<br/>
					and encourages another in malicious mindedness,<br/>
					approves of malicious mindedness,<br/>
					and speaks in praise of malicious mindedness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing these four qualities<br/>
					one is put into purgatory<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessing four qualities<br/>
					one is put into heaven<br/>
					according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He himself abstains from malicious mindedness,<br/>
					encourages another to abstain from malicious mindedness<br/>
					approves of abstaining from malicious mindedness<br/>
					and speaks in praise of abstaining from malicious mindedness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing these four qualities<br/>
