					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These are the five powers of a learner.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of faith,<br/>
					of conscientiousness,<br/>
					of fear of blame,<br/>
					of energy and<br/>
					of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the five powers of a learner.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">We will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of faith;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of conscientiousness;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of fear of blame;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of energy;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should ye train yourselves, monks.'</p>
