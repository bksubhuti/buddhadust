					<p class="f4">'Almost all beings find delight in pleasures,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> monks;<br/>
					and of the clansman, who has laid aside sickle and pingo<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and gone forth from the home to the homeless life, it is right to say:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"By faith has the clansman gone forth."</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasures, monks, are gotten in youth;<br/>
					yea, those of all kinds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, low pleasures and the middling sort and those that are high-pitched,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					they are all just reckoned pleasures.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> suppose a foolish baby boy,<br/>
					sprawling on his back, were, owing to the carelessness of his nurse, to put a piece of stick or stone in his mouth;<br/>
					with what utmost haste would she at once attend to the matter and quickly remove it.<br/>
					And if she could not get at it at once she would clasp him round the <span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span> head with her left hand,<br/>
					and with her right, crooking her finger, fetch it out, even though she drew blood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And why?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Monks, such a thing is a danger to the child;<br/>
					it is not harmless, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, such an act ought to be done by the nurse out of love,<br/>
					seeking the child's good,<br/>
					from pity and compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when that boy is older and sensible,<br/>
					then, monks, she no longer looks after him, knowing:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"The lad is now self-warded,<br/>
					has done with remissness."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In just the same way, monks, so long as right things are not done by a monk by faith, conscientiousness, fear of blame, energy and insight,<br/>
					that monk must be watched over by me;<br/>
					but when right things are so done,<br/>
					then I no longer look after him, knowing:<br/>
					"The monk is now self-warded,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> has done with remissness.</p>
