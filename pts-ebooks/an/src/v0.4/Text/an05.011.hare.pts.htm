					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I claim to have reached supreme mastery<br/>
					in things not heard of formerly.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> for a Tathāgata<br/>
					these are the five powers<br/>
					of one who has won through to the truth,<br/>
					possessed of which<br/>
					a Tathāgata claims the chief place,<br/>
					roars the lion's roar among the peoples<br/>
					and sets rolling the Divine Wheel.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of faith,<br/>
					the power of conscientiousness,<br/>
					the power of the fear of blame,<br/>
					the power of energy<br/>
					and the power of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, for a Tathāgata<br/>
					these are the five powers<br/>
					of one who has won through to the truth,<br/>
					possessed of which a Tathāgata claims the chief place,<br/>
					roars the lion's roar among the peoples<br/>
					and sets rolling the Divine Wheel.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> ii, 211 for this phrase, suggestive, where it stands, of later insertion; <i>Comy.</i> for <i>dhammā:</i> things, glosses with <i>catu-sacca-dhammā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> This passage recurs at <i>M.</i> i, 69; <i>S.</i> ii, 27; <i>A.</i> ii, 9; v, 33, etc., where generally ten powers are referred to, and are totally different from these five. As a set these five do not appear to occur except in this Section; they are included in the <i>Sevens</i>; see <i>A.</i> iv, 3, also <i>D.</i> iii, 253. It is difficult to see how they are the powers of a Tathāgata. <i>Comy.</i> observes: <i>Yathā tehi gantahbaṃ tath'eva gatāni pavattāni ñāṇabalāni.</i> See Introduction.</p>
