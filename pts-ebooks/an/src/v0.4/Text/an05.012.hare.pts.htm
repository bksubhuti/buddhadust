					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five powers of a learner.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of faith,<br/>
					conscientiousness,<br/>
					fear of blame,<br/>
					energy and insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the five.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, of these five learner's powers<br/>
					this is the chief,<br/>
					this is the binder,<br/>
					this is the tie,<br/>
					that to say:<br/>
					the power of insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> just as in a house with a peaked roof,<br/>
					this is the chief,<br/>
					this is the binder,<br/>
					this is the tie,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					that is to say:<br/>
					the peak;<br/>
					even so, monks,<br/>
					of these five learner's powers<br/>
					this is the chief,<br/>
					this is the binder,<br/>
					this is the tie,<br/>
					that to say:<br/>
					the power of insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">We will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of faith;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of conscientiousness;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of fear of blame;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of energy;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, monks.'</p>
