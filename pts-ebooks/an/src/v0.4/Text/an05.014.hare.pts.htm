					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of faith,<br/>
					the power of energy,<br/>
					the power of mindfulness,<br/>
					the power of concentration<br/>
					and the power of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the five powers.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks,<br/>
					is the power of faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					has faith<br/>
					and believes in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of a truth he is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened,<br/>
					abounding in wisdom and right,<br/>
					the well-gone,<br/>
					the world-knower,<br/>
					the incomparable tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					the teacher of devas and men,<br/>
					the Buddha,<br/>
					the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks,<br/>
					is the power of energy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					abiding in active energy,<br/>
					puts away all wrong things<br/>
					and takes to right things;<br/>
					steadfast and strenuous,<br/>
					he shirks not the burden of right things.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the power of mindfulness?</p>

					he remembers and calls to mind<br/>
					what was said and done long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the power of concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					aloof from sensuous appetites,<br/>
					aloof from evil ideas,<br/>
					enters and abides in the first <span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span> musing,<br/>
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>
					which is born of solitude<br/>
					and is full of joy and ease;<br/>
					suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>
					which is self-evolved,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					full of joy and ease,<br/>
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed;<br/>
					free from the zest for joy,<br/>
					mindful and self-possessed,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>
					and experiences in his being<br/>
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br/>
					'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease;<br/>
					by putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>
					by the passing away of happiness and misery<br/>
					he was wont to feel,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					which is utter purity of mindfulness,<br/>
					which comes of disinterestedness<br/>
					and is free of ease and ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					the power of concentration.</p>
