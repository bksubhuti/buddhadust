					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of faith,<br/>
					the power of energy,<br/>
					the power of mindfulness,<br/>
					the power of concentration<br/>
					and the power of insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, of these five learner's powers<br/>
					this is the chief,<br/>
					this is the binder,<br/>
					this is the tie,<br/>
					that to say:<br/>
					the power of insight.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as in a house with a peaked roof,<br/>
					this is the chief,<br/>
					this is the binder,<br/>
					this is the tie,<br/>
					that is to say:<br/>
					the peak;<br/>
					even so, monks,<br/>
					of these five powers<br/>
					this is the chief,<br/>
					this is the binder,<br/>
					this is the tie,<br/>
					that to say:<br/>
					the power of insight.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">We will become possessed of the power called the power of faith;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the power called the power of conscientiousness;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the power called the power of fear of blame;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the power called the power of energy;<br/>
					we will become possessed of the power called the power of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, monks.'</p>
