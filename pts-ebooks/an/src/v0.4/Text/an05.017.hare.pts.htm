					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five things<br/>
					a monk is set on his own good,<br/>
					but not the good of another.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk is perfect in virtue himself,<br/>
					but does not strive to perfect virtue in another;<br/>
					he is perfect in concentration himself,<br/>
					but does not strive to perfect concentration in another;<br/>
					his own release<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> is perfected,<br/>
					but he does not strive that another's should be;<br/>
					his own vision<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> and knowledge of release are perfected,<br/>
					but he does not strive that another's should be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessed of these five things<br/>
					a monk is set on his own good,<br/>
					but not the good of another.'</p>
