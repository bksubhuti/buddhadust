					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five things<br/>
					a monk is set on the good of another,<br/>
					but not his own good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk strives to perfect virtue in another<br/>
					but does not perfect virtue in himself;<br/>
					he strives to perfect concentration in another,<br/>
					but does perfect concentration in himself;<br/>
					he strives to perfect release in another,<br/>
					but he does not perfect release in himself;<br/>
					he strives to perfect vision and knowledge of release in another,<br/>
					but he does not perfect vision and knowledge of release in himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessed of these five things<br/>
					a monk is set on the good of another,<br/>
					but not his own good.</p>
