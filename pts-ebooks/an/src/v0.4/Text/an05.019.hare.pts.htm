					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five things<br/>
					a monk is neither set on his own good,<br/>
					nor the good of another.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk is neither perfect in virtue himself,<br/>
					nor does he strive to perfect virtue in another;<br/>
					he is neither perfect in concentration himself,<br/>
					nor does he strive to perfect concentration in another;<br/>
					neither is his own release is perfected,<br/>
					nor does he strive that another's should be;<br/>
					neither is his own vision and knowledge of release are perfected,<br/>
					nor does he strive that another's should be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessed of these five things<br/>
					a monk is neither set on his own good,<br/>
					nor the good of another.</p>
