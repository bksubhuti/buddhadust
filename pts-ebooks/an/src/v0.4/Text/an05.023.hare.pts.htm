					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> there are these five debasements of gold<br/>
					by reason of which<br/>
					debased gold is neither pliable<br/>
					nor workable,<br/>
					nor bright,<br/>
					but is brittle<br/>
					and of no use for the best work.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Iron,<br/>
					copper,<br/>
					tin,<br/>
					lead<br/>
					and silver.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these five debase gold.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But when gold is free of these five debasements,<br/>
					it is pliable<br/>
					and workable<br/>
					and bright,<br/>
					nor is it brittle,<br/>
					but fit for the best work;<br/>
					and whatever sort of ornament one wants,<br/>
					whether a signet-ring<br/>
					or an ear-ring,<br/>
					a necklace<br/>
					or a gold chain,<br/>

					there are these five debasements of the mind<br/>
