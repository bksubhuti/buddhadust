					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, helped on<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> by five things<br/>

					and the advantages of mind emancipation,<br/>
					ripens to insight-emancipation<br/>
					and the advantages of insight-emancipation.</p>

					<p class="f4">By what five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, right view<br/>
					is helped on by virtue,<br/>
					is helped on by learning,<br/>
					is helped on by discussion,<br/>
					is helped on by tranquillity<br/>
					is helped on by inward vision.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, helped on by these five things<br/>
					right view ripens to mind emancipation<br/>
					and the advantages of mind emancipation,<br/>
					ripens to insight-emancipation<br/>

As a tree, thus cared for, will grow quickly and bear fruit, so will right view, cared for by virtue, etc., grow quickly by reason of the Way and bear the fruit of mind-emancipation and insight-emancipation.</p>
