					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five spheres<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of release<br/>
					wherein the unreleased mind of a monk,<br/>
					abiding zealous,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and resolute,<br/>
					finds release;<br/>
					or the cankers,<br/>
					not yet wholly destroyed,<br/>
					come to complete destruction;<br/>
					or the unsurpassed peace from effort,<br/>
					not yet attained,<br/>
					is won.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, take the case when the Master,<br/>
					or some fellow in the godly life<br/>
					who acts as teacher,<br/>
					instructs a monk in Dhamma —<br/>
					while he teaches,<br/>
					that monk partakes of both the spirit<br/>
					and the letter<br/>
					of this Dhamma;<br/>
					when the Master,<br/>
					or some fellow in the godly life<br/>
					who acts as teacher,<br/>
					instructs a monk in Dhamma<br/>
					gladness<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> springs <span class="f2 g"><b>[16]</b></span> up;<br/>
					from that, zest;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					in such a state his whole<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> being calms down;<br/>
					when he is calm,<br/>
					ease is experienced;<br/>
					and for him who dwells at ease<br/>
					the mind is composed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the first sphere of release<br/>
					wherein the unreleased mind of a monk,<br/>
					abiding zealous,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and resolute,<br/>
					finds release;<br/>
					or the cankers,<br/>
					not yet wholly destroyed,<br/>
					come to complete destruction;<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, when the Master,<br/>
					or some fellow in the godly life<br/>
					who acts as teacher,<br/>
					does not instruct him in Dhamma,<br/>
					but he himself instructs others in detail<br/>
					as he has heard it,<br/>
					as he has learnt it by heart —<br/>
					while he thus teaches,<br/>
					that monk partakes of both the spirit<br/>
					and the letter<br/>
					of this Dhamma;<br/>
					when he himself instructs others in detail<br/>
					as he has heard dhamma,<br/>
					as he has learnt it by heart<br/>

					in such a state his whole being calms down;<br/>
					when he is calm,<br/>
					ease is experienced;<br/>

					the mind is composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the second sphere of release<br/>
					wherein the unreleased mind of a monk,<br/>
					abiding zealous,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and resolute,<br/>
					finds release;<br/>
					or the cankers,<br/>
					not yet wholly destroyed,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Or else, monks, when the Master,<br/>

					as he has heard it,<br/>

					and while doing so,<br/>
					that monk partakes of both the spirit<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the third sphere of release<br/>
