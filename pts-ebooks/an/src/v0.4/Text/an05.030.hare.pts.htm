					<p><span class="f2">[30]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[21]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One<br/>
					with a great company of monks,<br/>
					while wandering for alms among the Kosalese,<br/>
					came to the brahman village of Icchānangala<br/>
					belonging to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One dwelt in the Icchānangala woodland thicket.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brāhman householders of Icchānangala heard of this.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Mark you,' they said,<br/>
					the recluse, Master Gotama, the Sakya,<br/>
					gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br/>
					has come to Icchānangala<br/>
					and dwells in our wood near by;<br/>
					and of this same Master <span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span> Gotama<br/>
					this excellent report goes abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">He is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					perfectly enlightened,<br/>
					endowed with wisdom and righteousness,<br/>
					one well-gone,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					the unsurpassed,<br/>
					a tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					a teacher,<br/>
					a Buddha of devas and men,<br/>
					the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Having realized more-knowledge himself,<br/>
					he declares it to this world<br/>
					with its devas<br/>
					and Māras<br/>
					and Brahmas,<br/>
					to this earth with its recluses and brahmans,<br/>
					its devas and men;<br/>
					and he teaches Dhamma,<br/>
					lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle<br/>
					and lovely in the end;<br/>
					and sets forth the godly life,<br/>
					utterly pure and perfect,<br/>
					both in spirit and letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed is it to see such arahants!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the night was over,<br/>
					they went to the wood,<br/>
					taking with them a great deal of hard and soft food,<br/>
					and stood outside the entrance,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					making a great din and uproar.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Nāgita<br/>
					was the Exalted One's personal attendant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One called to the venerable Nāgita and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who are these, Nāgita, that make this great din and uproar?</p>

					<p class="f4">Like fisher folk, methinks,<br/>
					with a great haul of fish!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'These men, lord, are the brahman householders of Icchānangala,<br/>
					who wait outside the gateway.</p>

					<p class="f4">They have brought much hard and soft food<br/>
					for the Exalted One and for the Order.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have naught to do with homage, Nāgita,<br/>
					nor has homage aught to do with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					this happiness of renunciation,<br/>
					this happiness of seclusion,<br/>
					this happiness of calm<br/>
					and this happiness of enlightenment,<br/>
					which I can obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty,<br/>
					let him enjoy that dung-like happiness,<br/>
					that sluggish happiness,<br/>
					that happiness gotten of<br/>
					gains,<br/>
					favours<br/>
					and flattery.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, let the Exalted One accept (their offerings)!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Well-gone accept;<br/>
					now, lord,<br/>
					is the time for the Blessed One to accept!</p>

					<p class="f4">For wheresoever henceforth the Exalted One shall go,<br/>
					the brahman householders of town and country<br/>
					will be just as inclined (to give).</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, just as when the (rain-) deva <span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span> rains big drops,<br/>
					the water flows with the incline;<br/>
					even so, lord,<br/>
					wheresoever the Exalted One shall henceforth go,<br/>
					the brahman householders of town and country<br/>
					will be inclined.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, it is because of the virtue and wisdom of the Edited One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nāgita, I have naught to do with homage,<br/>
					nor has homage aught to do with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					this happiness of renunciation,<br/>
					this happiness of seclusion,<br/>
					this happiness of calm<br/>
					and this happiness of enlightenment,<br/>
					which I can obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty,<br/>
					let him enjoy that dung-like happiness,<br/>
					that sluggish happiness,<br/>
					that happiness<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> gotten of<br/>
					gains,<br/>
					favours<br/>
					and flattery.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Nāgita,<br/>
					whosoever eats,<br/>
					drinks,<br/>
					munches<br/>
					and crunches<br/>
					must answer the calls of nature;<br/>
					such is the issue of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever loves,<br/>
					to him change<br/>
					and a state of otherness<br/>
					must come,<br/>
					grief,<br/>
					lamentation,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow<br/>
					and despair;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					such is the issue of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever is bent on applying himself<br/>
					to the symbol of the unattractive.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					in him disgust for the symbol of the attractive<br/>
					is established;<br/>
					such is the issue of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever abides<br/>
					seeing impermanence in the six spheres of touch,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					in him disgust for touch is established;<br/>
					such is the issue of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Nāgita,<br/>
					whosoever abides seeing the rise and fall<br/>
					in the fivefold body of attachment,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					in him disgust for attachment is established;<br/>
					such is the issue of it.'</p>
