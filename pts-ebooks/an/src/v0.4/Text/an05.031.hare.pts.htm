					<p><span class="f2">[32]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[24]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there Sumanā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the rajah's daughter,<br/>
					with a following of five hundred royal maidens<br/>
					in five hundred chariots,<br/>
					came and visited him; and,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, she spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, suppose two of the Blessed One's disciples<br/>
					were alike in faith,<br/>
					alike in virtue<br/>
					and alike in insight,<br/>
					but one was an alms-giver<br/>
					and the other was not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both, on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>
					would be reborn in the happy heaven world;<br/>
					but among the devas, lord,<br/>
					would there be a distinction,<br/>
					a difference,<br/>
					between them?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'There would be, Sumanā,'<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The alms-giver,<br/>
					when come to deva-state,<br/>
					surpasses the non-giver<br/>
					in five ways:<br/>
					in divine life-span,<br/>
					beauty,<br/>
					happiness,<br/>
					honour<br/>
					and power.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In these five ways, Sumanā,<br/>
					the alms-giver,<br/>
					when come to deva-state,<br/>
					surpasses the non-giver.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'But if, lord,<br/>
					faring on thence,<br/>
					they should return to this state here;<br/>
					when become human, lord,<br/>
					would there be a distinction,<br/>
					a difference,<br/>
					between them?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'There would be, Sumanā,'<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The alms-giver,<br/>
					as man,<br/>
					surpasses the non-giver<br/>
					in five ways:<br/>
					in human life-span,<br/>
					beauty,<br/>
					happiness,<br/>
					honour<br/>
					and power.</p>

					<p class="f4">In these five ways, Sumanā,<br/>
					the alms-giver,<br/>
					as man,<br/>
					surpasses the non-giver.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'But if both, lord,<br/>
					were to go forth from the home<br/>
					into the <span class="f2 g"><b>[25]</b></span> homeless life;<br/>
					when gone forth, lord,<br/>
					would there be a distinction,<br/>
					a difference,<br/>
					between them?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'There would be, Sumanā,'<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The alms-giver,<br/>
					when gone forth,<br/>
					surpasses the non-giver<br/>
					in five ways:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					he is often asked to accept a robe,<br/>
					he is not rarely asked;<br/>
					often to accept alms,<br/>
					not rarely;<br/>
					often to accept a lodging,<br/>
					not rarely;<br/>
					often to accept medicaments for sickness,<br/>
					not rarely;<br/>
					with whomsoever he dwells<br/>
					in leading the godly life,<br/>
					such folk mostly act towards him with cordiality<br/>
					in their ways of living,<br/>
					talking<br/>
					and thinking;<br/>
					it is rare for them no to act cordially,<br/>
					cordially they offer service,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					seldom without cordiality.</p>

					<p class="f4">In these five ways, Sumanā,<br/>
					an alms-giver,<br/>
					when gone forth,<br/>
					surpasses the non-giver.*</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'But, lord, if both win arahantship;<br/>
					in that state<br/>
					would there be a distinction,<br/>
					a difference,<br/>
					between them?</p>

					<p class="f4">'In that case, Sumanā, I verily declare<br/>
					there is no difference whatsoever,<br/>
					that is to say,<br/>
					comparing emancipation<br/>
					with emancipation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is amazing, lord,<br/>
					it is wonderful, lord,<br/>
					how far-reaching is the effect of giving alms<br/>
					and doing good deeds,<br/>
					since they are a help<br/>
					and a boon to one<br/>
					as a deva,<br/>
					a help and a boon to one<br/>
					as a man,<br/>
					yea, a help and a boon<br/>
					when one has gone forth!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is even so, Sumanā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">51</a></sup></span><br/>
					far-reaching is the effect of giving alms<br/>
					and doing good deeds,<br/>
					since they are a help<br/>
					and a boon to one<br/>
					as a deva,<br/>
					a help and a boon to one<br/>
					as a man,<br/>
					yea, a help and a boon<br/>
					when one has gone forth!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One;<br/>
					and when the Well-gone had thus spoken,<br/>
					the Master spoke again and said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'As<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> stainless on her sky-bound course, the moon<br/>
							Outshines in splendour all the stars' array:<br/>
							Just so the virtuous, believing man<br/>
							In charity outshines the mean on earth.<br/>
							Ev'n<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> as the hundred cloud-peaked thunder-storm,<br/>
							In lightning wreathed, the hills and hollows fills<br/>
							Mean men in these five things: long life and honour,<br/>
							Beauty and happiness, abounding wealth;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
							And after death lives blissfully in heaven.'</p>
