					<p><span class="f2">[35]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[26]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Rājagaha, at the Squirrels' Feeding Ground<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> in the Bamboo Grove;<br/>
					and there Cundī,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the rajah's daughter,<br/>
					attended by five hundred maidens<br/>
					in a like number of chariots,<br/>
					came and visited him and,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seated, Cundī, the rajah's daughter, spoke to the Exalted One thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, our royal brother, Cunda, says this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When a woman or man has taken refuge in the Buddha,<br/>
					has taken refuge in Dhamma,<br/>
					has taken refuge in the Order,<br/>
					abstains from taking life,<br/>
					from taking what is not given,<br/>
					from carnal lusts,<br/>
					from lying<br/>
					and from indulging in spirituous liquor, causing idleness;<br/>
					he will surely arise,<br/>
					on the breaking up of the body alter death,<br/>
					to a fair course,<br/>
					not to an ill one.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I, lord, would ask the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">With one's trust in what sort of teacher will one surely arise,<br/>
					on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>
					to a fair course<br/>
					and not to an ill one?</p>

					<p class="f4">With one's trust in what sort of Dhamma will one surely arise,<br/>
					on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>
					to a fair course<br/>
					and not to an ill one?</p>

					<p class="f4">With one's trust in what sort of Order will one surely arise,<br/>
					on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>
					to a fair course<br/>
					and not to an ill one?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what sorts of virtuous practices must one perform<br/>
					to arise, after death,<br/>
					to a fair course and not to an ill one?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> 'Whatsoever beings there are, Cundī, whether footless, two- <span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span> footed, four-footed or many-footed,<br/>
					whether with bodies or without,<br/>
					conscious or unconscious or neither conscious nor unconscious,<br/>
					of them the Tathāgata,<br/>

					the perfectly enlightened One,<span class="f3"><sup>4</sup></span> is declared the best;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					whosoever put their trust in the Buddha,<br/>
					put their trust in the best,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever Dhammas are formulated<br/>
					or not formulated,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> Cundī,<br/>
					of them (the Dhamma of) dispassion is declared the best.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean: the crushing of pride,<br/>
					the quenching of thirst,<br/>
					the rooting out of lust,<br/>
					the cutting off of rebirth,<br/>
					the destruction of craving,<br/>
					dispassion,<br/>
					making an end,<br/>

					whosoever put their trust in (this) Dhamma,<br/>
					put their trust in the best,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever orders or communities there are, Cundī,<br/>
					of them the Order of the Tathāgata's disciples is declared the best,<br/>
					that is to say,<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> the eight persons,<br/>
					that Order of disciples of the Exalted One,<br/>

					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					the world's peerless field for merit;<br/>
					whosoever put their trust in the Order,<br/>
					put their trust in the best,<br/>
					and unto them is the best reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever virtuous practices there are, Cundī,<br/>
					of them those<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> loved by the Ariyans are declared the best,<br/>
					that is to say,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span> those unbroken and without a rent,<br/>
					untarnished and without blemish,<br/>
					bringing freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise,<br/>
					incorrupt<br/>
					and conducive to concentration;<br/>
					whosoever perform the virtues,<br/>
					loved by the Ariyans,<br/>
					perform the best,<br/>
					and unto them is the best reward.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">For pious men who truly in the best<br/>
							Distinguish best;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> who in the Buddha see<br/>
							The gift-worthy, the unsurpassed, the best;<br/>
							In Dhamma best the ease of passion's calm;<br/>
							And in the Order best the unrivalled field<br/>
							For merit - yea, for those who alms bestow<br/>
							In the best place best merit doth increase,<br/>
							And life and beauty, honour, fame and power,<br/>
							Best happiness. Who gives unto the best,<br/>
							Wise man, in Dhamma best composed, as man<br/>
							Or deva, with the best attained, finds joy.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This 'park' was given to the Older by the rajah Bimbisāra of Magadha (<i>Vin.</i> i, 39); for the legend of its name see Rockhill's <i>Life,</i> 43; Watter's <i>Yuan Chwang,</i> ii, 157; it was the first of its kind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Except at <i>A.</i> iv, 347 in a list and here she does not seem to be mentioned; <i>Comy.</i> on <i>A.</i> iv: <i>rajakumdri,</i> merely; here we have no comment. She and her brother (not mentioned elsewhere) may have been the children of Bimbisāra, who had at least three wives; see C.H.I. i, 183. Pron. Choondee.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Omitting the fourth clause, what follows recurs at <i>A.</i> ii. 34; <i>It.</i> 87, including the <i>gāthā.</i> See <i>G.S.</i> ii. 38.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> This clause also recurs at <i>A</i>. v, 21; <i>Mil.</i> 217.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Agga:</i> tip, top, first, chief, illustrious.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> This clause is dealt with exegetically at <i>Vism.</i> trsl. 337, whore <i>dhammā</i> is said to mean states, conditions; <i>sankhatā,</i> conditioned, compounded; see also <i>P.E.D. s.v. yavatā.</i> But it is inconceivable that the B. should talk about 'things definite and indefinite' (<i>P.E.D.</i>) to a young woman who asks him: 'What is truth?' but with Marcus Aurelius he might well say: 'First and foremost, keep unperturbed!' (<i>To himself,</i> viii, 5; Rendall's <i>trsl.,</i> 1910); <i>cf. Vin.</i> iii, 20: <i>bhagavatā anekapariyāyena rāgavirāgāya dhammo desito, madanimmadanāya,</i> etc., as here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> For these last three clauses <i>cf.</i> <i>D.</i> ii, 94; iii, 227; <i>S.</i> iv, 272, and <i>Vism.</i> <i>trsl.</i> 252 ff.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> Those on the four stages of the Way; see <i>Vism.</i> trsl. 253.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> inserts <i>sīlāni,</i> with two MSS., and observes: <i>magga-phala-sampayuttakāni sīlāni, D.A.</i> ii, 544: <i>pañca sīlani.</i> I suppose it is because these five are mentioned that this sutta is included in the 'Fives.'</p>
