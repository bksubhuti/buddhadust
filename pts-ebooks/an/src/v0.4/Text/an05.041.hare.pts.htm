					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[37]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					in Jeta Grove, at Anāthapiṇdika's Park;<br/>
					and there Anathapiṇḍika, the householder, came and visited him and,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					the Exalted One said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Householder, there are these five reasons for getting<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> rich.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the case of an Ariyan disciple<br/>
					with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br/>
					gathered by the strength of the arm,<br/>
					earned by the sweat of the brow,<br/>
					justly obtained in a lawful way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> —<br/>
					he makes himself happy,<br/>
					glad,<br/>
					and keeps that great happiness,<br/>
					he makes his parents happy,<br/>
					glad,<br/>
					and keeps them so;<br/>
					he makes his wife and children,<br/>
					glad,<br/>
					and keeps them so;<br/>
					he makes his slaves,<br/>
					glad,<br/>
					and keeps them so;<br/>
					he makes work-folk and men,<br/>
					glad,<br/>
					and keeps them so.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first reason for getting rich.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br/>
					gathered by the strength of the arm,<br/>
					earned by the sweat of the brow,<br/>
					justly obtained in a lawful way,<br/>
					he makes his friends and companions happy,<br/>
					glad,<br/>
					and keeps them so.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second reason for getting rich.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br/>
					gathered by the strength of the arm,<br/>
					earned by the sweat of the brow,<br/>
					justly obtained in a lawful way,<br/>
					ill-luck from fire and water,<br/>
					rajahs and robbers,<br/>
					enemies and heirs<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is warded off,<br/>
					and he keeps his goods in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third reason for getting rich.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br/>
					gathered by the strength of the arm,<br/>
					earned by the sweat of the brow,<br/>
					justly obtained in a lawful way,<br/>
					he makes the five oblations,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					that is to say:<br/>
					oblations to kin,<br/>
					guests,<br/>
					petas,<br/>
					rajahs<br/>
					and devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth reason for getting rich.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span> Moreover, householder, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br/>
					gathered by the strength of the arm,<br/>
					earned by the sweat of the brow,<br/>
					justly obtained in a lawful way,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple institutes offerings,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					of lofty aim,<br/>
					celestial,<br/>
					ripening to happiness,<br/>
					leading heavenward,<br/>
					for all those recluses and godly men<br/>
					who abstain from pride and indolence,<br/>
					who bear all things in patience and humility,<br/>
					each mastering self,<br/>
					each calming self,<br/>
					each perfecting self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth reason for getting rich.</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder, there are these five reasons for getting rich.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, if the wealth of that Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					heeding these five reasons,<br/>
					come to destruction,<br/>
					let him consider thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"At least, I've heeded<br/>
					those reasons for getting rich,<br/>
					but my wealth has gone!" —</p>

					<p class="f4">thus he is not upset.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And if his wealth increase,<br/>
					let him think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truly, I've heeded<br/>
					those reasons for getting rich,<br/>
					and my wealth has grown! —</p>

					<p class="f4">thus he is not upset in either case.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Bred,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> borne and battened is my household all<br/>
							Upon my wealth; I've warded off ill-luck;<br/>
							Made five oblations; furnished those good men.<br/>
							Who lead the godly life composed, with gifts<br/>
							And offerings of lofty aim; that meed,<br/>
							The wealth wise householders should seek, by me<br/>
							Is won — whatever befall there's no regret!"</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whoso considers thus, that man firm set<br/>
							In Ariyan Dhamma here on earth they praise.<br/>
							And afterwards in heaven he finds delight.</p>
