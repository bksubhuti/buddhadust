					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Anāthapiṇḍika, the householder, visited the Exalted One and,<br/>
					saluting him,<br/>
					sat down at one side;<br/>
					and so seated,<br/>
					the Exalted One spoke to him and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are these five things, householder,<br/>
					which are welcome,<br/>
					sought after,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					but hard to get in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Long life, householder,<br/>
					is welcome,<br/>
					sought after,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					but hard to get in the world;</p>

					<p class="f4">beauty, householder,<br/>
					is welcome,<br/>
					sought after,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					but hard to get in the world;</p>

					<p class="f4">happiness, householder,<br/>
					is welcome,<br/>
					sought after,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					but hard to get in the world;</p>

					<p class="f4">honour, householder,<br/>
					is welcome,<br/>
					sought after,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					but hard to get in the world;</p>

					<p class="f4">the heaven-worlds, householder,<br/>
					is welcome,<br/>
					sought after,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					but hard to get in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, householder, are the five things,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now these five things, householder,<br/>
