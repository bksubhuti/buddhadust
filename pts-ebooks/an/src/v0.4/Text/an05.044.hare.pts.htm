					<p><span class="f2">[49]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[40]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Vesāli,<br/>
					at the Gabled Hall,<br/>
					in Mahāvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One,<br/>
					robing himself before noon,<br/>
					went to the house of Ugga,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Vesāliyan householder,<br/>
					and sat down on the seat ready there.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Ugga, the Vesāliyan householder,<br/>
					approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'From the mouth of the Exalted One<br/>
					have I heard this, lord;<br/>
					from his own mouth have I received this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The giver of good<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> things<br/>
					gains the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, to me the gruel<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> from sāl <span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span> flowers<br/>
					is good eating;<br/>
					let the Exalted One accept some from me<br/>
					out of pity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One accepted<br/>
					out of pity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'From the mouth of the Exalted One<br/>
					have I heard this, lord;<br/>
					from his own mouth<br/>
					have I received this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The giver of good things<br/>
					gains the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, to me the flesh of pigs<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					with plenty of jujube fruit<br/>
					is good eating;<br/>
					let the Exalted One accept some from me<br/>
					out of pity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One accepted<br/>
					out of pity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'From the mouth of the Exalted One<br/>
					have I heard this, lord;<br/>
					from his own mouth<br/>
					have I received this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The giver of good things<br/>
					gains the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, to me the oily tube-like vegetable<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					is good eating;<br/>
					let the Exalted One accept some from me<br/>
					out of pity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One accepted<br/>
					out of pity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'From the mouth of the Exalted One<br/>
					have I heard this, lord;<br/>
					from his own mouth<br/>
					have I received this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The giver of good things<br/>
					gains the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, to me a mess of rice,<br/>
					cleaned of black grains,<br/>
					served with assorted curries and condiments<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					is good eating;<br/>
					let the Exalted One accept some from me<br/>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One accepted<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'From the mouth of the Exalted One<br/>
					have I heard this, lord;<br/>
					from his own mouth<br/>
					have I received this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The giver of good things<br/>
					gains the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, to me good is muslins from Benares<br/>
					let the Exalted One accept some from me<br/>
					out of pity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One accepted<br/>
					out of pity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'From the mouth of the Exalted One<br/>
					have I heard this, lord;<br/>
					from his own mouth<br/>
					have I received this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The giver of good things<br/>
					gains the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, to me good is a couch<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					with a fleecy cover,<br/>
					woollen cloth or coverlet,<br/>
					spread with rugs of deer-skins,<br/>
					with awnings over it<br/>
					and crimson cushions at either end,<br/>
					and though we know, lord,<br/>
					that it is not suitable<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> for the Exalted One:<br/>
					this sandalwood plank of mine,<br/>
					worth more than a hundred thousand —<br/>
					yet let the Exalted One accept it out of pity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One accepted out of pity.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One gave thanks to Ugga, the Vesāliyan,<br/>
					with this benediction:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Who gives the good shall gain the good; he who<br/>
							To upright men gives willingly clothes, bed,<br/>
							Food, drink, the needful requisites; and what's<br/>
							Foregone, put by, obsesses<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> not the mind.<br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[42]</b></span> Whoso in arahants doth find a field<br/>
							For gifts, wise man, foregoing what is hard,<br/>
							In giving thus, the good shall gain the good.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One had thus given thanks to Ugga, the Vesāliyan<br/>
					he rose from his seat and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in due course<br/>
					Ugga the householder died<br/>
					and thereafter arose in a certain inferable world.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/>
					and there,<br/>
					when the night was far spent,<br/>
					Ugga the deva,<br/>
					in lovely radiance,<br/>
					lighting up the whole of Jeta Grove,<br/>
					came and visited him and,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One spoke to him,<br/>
					standing there,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I hope, Ugga,<br/>
					things are with you<br/>
					as we hoped?</p>

					<p class="f4">To be sure, lord,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					things are as the Exalted One hoped.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed this verse to Ugga, the deva:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Who gives the good shall gain the good; who gives<br/>
							The best shall best receive again; the choice,<br/>
							The choice receive; the chief, the chief place win.<br/>
							Who gives the best, the choice, the chief — that man<br/>
							Has honour and long life wherever he rise.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>
