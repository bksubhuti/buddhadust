					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are these five treasures, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The treasure of faith,<br/>
					of virtue,<br/>
					of learning,<br/>
					of charity<br/>
					and of insight.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the treasure of faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has faith;<br/>
					he believes thus of the tathagata's awakening: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a truth he is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully awakened,<br/>
					adept in knowledge and conduct,<br/>
					well going,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					incomparable,<br/>
					tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					among devas and men the teacher,<br/>
					Buddha,<br/>
					Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					the treasure of faith.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the treasure of virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple abstains from taking life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					from taking what is not given,<br/>
					from carnal lusts,<br/>
					from lying,<br/>
					abstains from taking sloth-causing<br/>
					liquors,<br/>
					spirits,<br/>
					wines.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					the treasure of virtue.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the treasure of learning?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has learning<br/>
					and a memory, retentive and well stored<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn2" href="#edn2">ed2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and those things,<br/>
					lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely in the end,<br/>
					which set forth in meaning and detail the godly life,<br/>
					wholly fulfilled,<br/>
					perfectly pure;<br/>
					all those are heard much by him,<br/>
					retained in mind,<br/>
					familiarized by talk,<br/>
					pored over,<br/>
					well penetrated by right view.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is<br/>
					the treasure of learning.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the treasure of charity?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					living the householder's life,<br/>
					is free in heart<br/>
					from the stain of avarice;<br/>
					given over to charity,<br/>
					open-handed,<br/>
					delighting in making presents,<br/>
					he is <span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span> ready to comply with another's request<br/>
					and finds pleasure in alms giving.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					the treasure of charity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the treasure of insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has insight;<br/>
					he possesses insight<br/>
					into the way of growth and decay,<br/>
					and Ariyan penetration<br/>
					into the way<br/>
					to the utter destruction of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the treasure of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are verily the five treasures.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Faith<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in the Tathāgata, unshaken, firm;<br/>
							Fair virtue, praised and loved by Ariyans;<br/>
							Serenity<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> in seeing upright men<br/>
							And in the Order — he whose way is thus,<br/>
							No beggar is he called, nor vain his life.<br/>
							Wherefore faith, virtue and serenity,<br/>
							Wise men, discerning Dhamma, e'er pursue,<br/>
							Remembering the message Buddhas bring.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare abbreviates here but there is not one case where he has translated the virtues in full. The missing lines (on taking what is not given, 'carnal lusts' and lying — <i>adinnādānā paṭivirato hoti, kāmesumicchācārā paṭivirato hoti, musā-vādā paṭivirato hoti</i>) are supplied from Volume III of the <i>G.S.,</i> translated by Woodward.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a></sup> Hare abbreviates here and in G.S. 7.6 translates differently. I have adapted his translation there to his translation here.</p>
