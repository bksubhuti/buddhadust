					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2">[57]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[48]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">One time the venerable Nārada<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> dwelt near Pāṭaliputta,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					in the Cock's Park.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Bhaddā, the dear and beloved ranee of rajah Muṇḍa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> died;<br/>
					and because of the loss of his dear ranee, Bhaddā,<br/>
					he neither bathed,<br/>
					nor anointed himself,<br/>
					nor partook of any food,<br/>
					nor concerned himself with any affairs,<br/>
					but day and night<br/>
					clung in grief to her body<br/>
					as though a-swoon.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">After a while he summoned his treasurer, Piyaka,<br/>
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Prythee, friend Piyaka,<br/>
					place the body of the ranee, Bhaddā,<br/>
					in an oil vessel made of iron<br/>
					and cover it over with another iron vessel,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					so that we shall see her body longer.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sire,' Hyaka replied,<br/>
					and he placed the body of the ranee, Bhaddā,<br/>
					in an oil vessel made of iron<br/>
					and covered it over with another iron vessel.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Piyaka, the treasurer, thought to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhaddā,<br/>
					the dear, beloved ranee of rajah Muṇḍa, is dead;<br/>
					and because of this <span class="f2 g"><b>[49]</b></span> loss,<br/>
					the rajah not even bathes<br/>
					or anoints himself,<br/>
					nor eats food,<br/>
					nor concerns himself with his affairs,<br/>
					but clings in grief to her body<br/>
					as though a-swoon.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What if rajah Muṇḍa go<br/>
					and wait upon some recluse or godly man!</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had learnt Dhamma,<br/>
					he would pluck out the dart of sorrow.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And again he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Near Pāṭaliputta,<br/>
					in the Cock's Park,<br/>
					dwells this venerable Nārada;<br/>
					and of that same reverend sir<br/>
					this fair report is gone abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A sage is he,<br/>
					accomplished,<br/>
					wise,<br/>
					learned,<br/>
					an able speaker,<br/>
					of ready, gracious wit,<br/>
					both venerable<br/>
					and arahant.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Methinks, if rajah Muṇḍa were to go and wait upon the venerable Nārada,<br/>
					perhaps, after listening to the venerable one's Dhamma,<br/>
					he would pluck out the dart of sorrow.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So Piyaka, the treasurer,<br/>
					approached the rajah and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sire, this venerable Nārada dwells hard by Pāṭaliputta,<br/>
					in the Cock's Park;<br/>
					now of him a fair report has gone abroad,<br/>
					that he is a sage,<br/>
					accomplished,<br/>
					wise,<br/>
					learned,<br/>
					an able speaker,<br/>
					of ready, gracious wit,<br/>
					both venerable<br/>
					and arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe, if my lord were to go and wait upon the venerable one,<br/>
					he could,<br/>
					after listening to the venerable Nārada's Dhamma,<br/>
					pluck out the dart of sorrow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, friend Piyaka,<br/>
					announce (my coming) to the venerable Nārada.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">How, I wonder,<br/>
					ought one like me<br/>
					to approach a recluse or godly man,<br/>
					previously unknown,<br/>
					dwelling in the kingdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sire,' he replied;<br/>
					and Piyaka, the treasurer,<br/>
					went and visited the venerable Nārada<br/>
					and saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					he spoke thus to the venerable one:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sir, Bhaddā, the dear and beloved ranee of rajah has died;<br/>
					and because of his loss<br/>
					the rajah neither bathes<br/>
					nor anoints himself,<br/>
					,<br/>
					nor eats food,<br/>
					nor concerns himself with his affairs,<br/>
					but <span class="f2 g"><b>[50]</b></span> clings in grief to her body<br/>
					as though a-swoon.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good it were, reverend sir,<br/>
					if the venerable Nārada were to teach such Dhamma<br/>
					that rajah Muṇḍa, having heard,<br/>
					might pluck out the dart of sorrow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now is the time, Piyaka,<br/>
					for the rajah Muṇḍa to do as he thinks fit.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Piyaka, the treasurer, got up from his seat,<br/>
					saluted the venerable Nārada<br/>
					and took his leave,<br/>
					keeping the venerable one on his right;<br/>
					and approaching the rajah,<br/>
					he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sire, I have made occasion with the venerable Nārada;<br/>
					sire, now is the time to do as you think fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, friend Piyaka,<br/>
					have our state carriages got ready.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sire,' he replied;<br/>
					and when he had done so,<br/>
					he told the rajah:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sire, the state carriages await you.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then rajah Muṇḍa got up into a state carriage<br/>
					and with many others<br/>
					went off in royal pomp and power<br/>
					to see the venerable Nārada<br/>
					at the Cock's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having gone by carriage as far as the ground allowed,<br/>
					he got down and entered the Park on foot.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the rajah Muṇḍa approached the venerable Nārada,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and the venerable Nārada spoke thus to him,<br/>
					so seated:</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are, Maharajah, five states not to be got to<br/>
