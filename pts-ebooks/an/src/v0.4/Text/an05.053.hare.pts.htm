					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five limbs of striving.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk has faith,<br/>
					he believes in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata:<br/>
					"Of a truth he is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened,<br/>
					abounding in wisdom and right,<br/>
					the well-gone,<br/>
					the world-knower,<br/>
					the incomparable tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					the teacher of devas and men,<br/>
					the Buddha, the Exalted One";</p>

					<p class="f4">he has health and well-being,<br/>
					a good digestion,<br/>
					which is neither over-cold<br/>
					nor overheated,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					but even<br/>
					and suitable for striving;</p>

					<p class="f4">he is neither deceitful<br/>
					nor a make-believe,<br/>
					but declares himself to the Master<br/>
					or to his wise fellows in the godly life<br/>
					just as he really is;</p>

					<p class="f4">he lives striving hard<br/>
					to give up evil things,<br/>
					and to hold to good things;<br/>
					staunch and strong in effort,<br/>
					he shirks not the burden of righteousness;</p>

					<p class="f4">he has insight<br/>
					and is endowed therewith<br/>
					into the way of the rise and fall of things,<br/>
					with Ariyan penetration<br/>
					into the utter destruction of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the five limbs of striving.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> observes that a digestion that is over-cold is 'cold-shy,' and similarly for the over-heated.</p>
