					<p><span class="f2">[69]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk approached his preceptor and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">My body, sir, is as it were drugged;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					the quarters are not seen by me;<br/>
					things<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> are not clear to me;<br/>
					sloth and torpor compass my heart about and stay;<br/>
					joyless,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> I live the holy life;<br/>
					and doubts about things are ever with me.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So that monk<br/>
					with his fellow-monk<br/>
					went to the Exalted Otte and,<br/>
					on arrival,<br/>
					saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the preceptor said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, this monk speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"My body, sir, is as it were drugged;<br/>
					the quartets are not seen by me;<br/>
					things are not clear to me;<br/>
					sloth and torpor compass my heart about and stay;<br/>
					joyless, I live the godly life;<br/>
					and doubts about things are ever with me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(And the Exalted One said:)</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monk, it is ever thus!</p>

					<p class="f4">When one dwells with doors of the senses unguarded,<br/>
					with no moderation in eating,<br/>
					not bent on <span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span> vigilance,<br/>
					not looking<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> for righteous things,<br/>
					nor day in day out<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					practise the practice<br/>
					of making become the things<br/>
					that are wings to enlightenment;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					then is the body as though drugged,<br/>
					the quarters are not seen,<br/>
					things are not clear,<br/>
					sloth and torpor compass the heart and stay;<br/>
					joyless, one lives the godly life;<br/>
					and doubts about things are ever with one.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, train yourself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will make the guard-doors of the senses become more,<br/>
					I will be moderate in eating,<br/>
					bent on vigilance,<br/>
					look for righteous things<br/>
					and dwell, day in day out,<br/>
					practising the practice<br/>
					of making become the things<br/>
					that are wings to enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourself in this way, monk.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that monk, admonished with this admonishment by the Exalted One,<br/>
					got up and saluted the Exalted One and departed,<br/>
					keeping him on his right.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long afterwards,<br/>
					dwelling alone,<br/>
					secluded,<br/>
					zealous,<br/>
					earnest<br/>
					and resolved,<br/>
					that monk entered and abode<br/>
					in that unsurpassed goal of the godly life,<br/>
					realizing it by personal knowledge<br/>
					even, in this life;<br/>
					for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home<br/>
					into the homeless life;<br/>
					and he fully realized:</p>

					<p class="f4">Rebirth is destroyed,<br/>
					lived is the godly life,<br/>
					done is what had to be done,<br/>
					and there is no more of this state.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that monk was numbered among the arahants.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that monk, with arahantship won,<br/>
					went to his preceptor and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, no longer is my body as it were drugged;<br/>
					the four quarters are visible;<br/>
					things are clear;<br/>
					sloth and torpor no longer compass my heart and stay;<br/>
					with joy I live the godly life;<br/>
					and I have no doubts about things.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So that monk<br/>
					with his fellow-monk<br/>
					went to the Exalted Otte and,<br/>
					on arrival,<br/>
					saluted and sat down at one side.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the preceptor said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, this monk speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, no longer is my body as it were drugged;<br/>
					the four quarters are visible;<br/>
					things are clear;<br/>
					sloth and torpor no longer compass my heart and stay;<br/>
					with joy I live the godly life;<br/>
					and I have no doubts about things.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monk, it is ever thus!</p>

					<p class="f4">When one dwells with doors of the senses guarded,<br/>
					with moderation in eating,<br/>
					bent on vigilance,<br/>
					looking for righteous things,<br/>
					day in day out <br/>
					practise the practice<br/>
					of making become the things<br/>
					that are wings to enlightenment; <br/>
					then the body is not as though drugged,<br/>
					the quarters are seen,<br/>
					things are clear,<br/>
					sloth and torpor do not compass the heart and stay;<br/>
					joyful, one lives the godly life;<br/>
					and doubts about things are never with one.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, train yourself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will make the guard-doors of the senses become more,<br/>
					I will be moderate in eating,<br/>
					bent on vigilance,<br/>
					look for righteous things<br/>
					and dwell, day in day out,<br/>
					practising the practice<br/>
					of making become the things<br/>
					that are wings to enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourseves in this way, monks.'</p>
