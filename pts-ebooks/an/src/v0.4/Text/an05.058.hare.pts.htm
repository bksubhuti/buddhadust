					<p><span class="f2">[75]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[62]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Exalted One dwelt near Veaālī,<br/>
					at the Cabled Hall,<br/>
					in Mahāvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">And early one morning,<br/>
					after dressing,<br/>
					the Exalted One took bowl and robe<br/>
					and entered Veaālī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having gone his round,<br/>
					on his return,<br/>
					after the midday meal,<br/>
					he made his way into the great forest of Mahāvana,<br/>
					and sat down for the noonday rest<br/>
					at the foot of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a company, of Lacchavi young men<br/>
					were out stalking and ranging in Mahāvana;<br/>
					they had their bows strung<br/>
					and were surrounded by a pack of dogs;<br/>
					and they saw the Exalted One<br/>
					seated at the foot of the tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at that sight<br/>
					they cast aside their bows,<br/>
					called off their dogs<br/>
					and approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and stood with hands upraised<br/>
					in silence reverencing him.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just then Mahānāma,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Licchavi,<br/>
					was stretching his legs in Mahāvana<br/>
					by walking up and down;<br/>
					and he saw those young Licchavis<br/>
					with upraised hands<br/>
					silently reverencing the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Mahānāma, the Licchavi,<br/>
					went to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said with bated breath:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'They will become Vajjians,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					they will become Vajjians!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But why, Mahānāma, dost thou speak so:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They will become Vajjians!"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, these Licchavi young men<br/>
					are quick-tempered,<br/>
					rough,<br/>
					greedy fellows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such presents as are sent<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> by clan folk —<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[63]</b></span> sugar-cane,<br/>
					jujube fruit,<br/>
					sweet cakes,<br/>
					sweetmeats<br/>
					and lolly-pops<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> —<br/>
					they go about plundering and eating;<br/>
					they slap the women and the girls of the clan on the back.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Such are these fellows<br/>
					who now with upraised hands<br/>
					stand in silence reverencing the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Where soever these five conditions are found, Mahānāma,<br/>
					whether in a crowned warrior-rajah,<br/>
					or in a countryman living on his paternal<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> farm,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> We are not able to link up this Mahānāma with others of that name, either, <i>e.g.</i> with him of the first five disciples, or the Sakyan lay-kinsman. It is possible that we have a name substituted, when <i>written</i> suttas involved many blurred words, for the forgotten name of a disciple. Rhys Davids lists Licchavis and Videhas as forming two branches of one Vajjian confederacy, but this sutta points to Licchavis as <i>not</i> Vajjians, a more cultured oligarchy. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Dial.</i> ii, p. 79ff.; <i>Buddh.
