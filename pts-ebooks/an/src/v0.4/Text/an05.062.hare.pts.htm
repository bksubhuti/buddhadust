					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five thoughts,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					made an increase in,<br/>
					are very fruitful,<br/>
					of great advantage,<br/>
					merging in the deathless,<br/>
					having the deathless as their goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of impermanence;<br/>
					of not-self;<br/>
					of death;<br/>
					of the cloying of food;<br/>
					of distaste as to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these five thoughts,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					made an increase in,<br/>
					are very fruitful,<br/>
					of great advantage,<br/>
					merging in the deathless,<br/>
					having the deathless as their goal.'</p>
