					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk endowed with five qualities,<br/>
					is a fitting example<br/>
					to his fellows in the godly life.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk<br/>
					in himself has achieved virtue<br/>
					and explains a question prepared<br/>
					by a talk on the achieving of virtue;</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, a monk in himself has achieved concentration<br/>
					and explains a question prepared<br/>
					by a talk on the achieving of concentration;</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, a monk in himself has achieved insight<br/>
					and explains a question prepared<br/>
					by a talk on the achieving of insight;</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, a monk in himself has achieved emancipation<br/>
					and explains a question prepared<br/>
					by a talk on the achieving of insight;</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, a monk in himself has achieved the knowledge and insight of emancipation<br/>
					and explains a question prepared<br/>
					by a talk on the achieving of knowledge and insight of emancipation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, endowed with these five qualities,<br/>
					is a fitting example<br/>
					to his fellows in the godly life.'</p>
