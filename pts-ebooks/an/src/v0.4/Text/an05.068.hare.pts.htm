					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, before I became enlightened,<br/>
					while I was still a bodhisat<br/>
					without complete enlightenment,<br/>
					I made five qualities become,<br/>
					I made an increase in five qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein I made become the psychic power<br/>
					which embraces desire-to-do,<br/>
					combined with concentration and resolution;</p>

					<p class="f4">I made become the psychic power<br/>
					which embraces energy,<br/>
					combined with concentration and resolution;</p>

					<p class="f4">I made become the psychic power<br/>
					which embraces thought,<br/>
					combined with concentration and resolution;</p>

					<p class="f4">I made become the psychic power<br/>
					which embraces investigation,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when I had made these qualities become,<br/>
