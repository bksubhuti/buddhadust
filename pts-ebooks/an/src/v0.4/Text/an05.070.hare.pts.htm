					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five things,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					made an or crease in,<br/>
					lead to the destruction of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk abides<br/>
					perceiving the foulness of the body;<br/>
					is conscious of the cloying of food;<br/>
					is conscious of distaste as to the world;<br/>
					perceives impermanence in all compounded things;<br/>
					and the thought of death is by him inwardly well established.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these five things,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					made an ir crease in,<br/>
					lead to the destruction of the cankers.</p>
