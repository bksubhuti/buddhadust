					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five things,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					made an increase in,<br/>
					have as their fruits<br/>
					mind-emancipation<br/>
					and the advantages thereof,<br/>
					insight-emancipation<br/>
					and the advantages thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought of impermanence,<br/>
					the thought of ill in impermanence,<br/>
					the thought of no-self in ill,<br/>
					the thought of renunciation,<br/>
					and the thought of dispassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these five things,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					made an increase in,<br/>
					have as their fruits<br/>
					mind-emancipation<br/>
					and the advantages thereof,<br/>
					insight-emancipation<br/>
					and the advantages thereof.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when indeed a monk is both<br/>
					mind-emancipated<br/>
					and insight-emancipated,<br/>
					that monk is said to have lifted the barrier,<br/>
					filled in the moat,<br/>
					pulled up the pillar,<br/>
					withdrawn the bolts,<br/>
					an Ariyan,<br/>
					with flag laid low,<br/>
					with burden dropped,<br/>
					free of the fetters.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks,<br/>
					has the monk lifted the barrier?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein by the monk<br/>
					ignorance is got rid of,<br/>
					cut down to the roots,<br/>
					made as a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made so that it cannot grow up in the future,<br/>
					conditioned so that it cannot rise again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, has the monk<br/>
					lifted the barrier.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, has the monk<br/>
					filled in the moat?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein by the monk<br/>
					coming-to-be again,<br/>
					birth<br/>
					and faring on<br/>
					are got rid of,<br/>
					cut down to the roots,<br/>
					made as a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made so that it cannot grow up in the future,<br/>
					conditioned so that it cannot rise again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, has the monk<br/>
					filled in the moat.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, has the monk<br/>
					pulled up the pillar?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein by the monk<br/>
					craving is got rid of,<br/>
					cut down to the roots,<br/>
					made as a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made so that it cannot grow up in the future,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, has the monk<br/>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, has the monk<br/>

					<p class="f4">Herein by the monk<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, is the monk an Ariyan,<br/>
					with flag laid low,<br/>
					with burden dropped,<br/>
					free of the fetters.'</p>
