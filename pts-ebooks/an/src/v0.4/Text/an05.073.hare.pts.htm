					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk visited the Exalted One, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted <span class="f2 g"><b>[71]</b></span> One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, they say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Living by Dhamma,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> living by Dbamma!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, how does a monk live by Dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monk, consider<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the monk who masters Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">the sayings,<br/>
					psalms,<br/>
					catechisms,<br/>
					songs,<br/>
					solemnities,<br/>
					speeches,<br/>
					birth-stories,<br/>
					marvels<br/>
					and runes<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> -</p>

					<p class="f4">he spends the day in that mastery;<br/>
					he neglects to go apart<span class="f4"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> (for meditation)<br/>
					and devotes not himself<br/>
					to calm of purpose of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> to master,<br/>
					but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider the monk who teaches others Dhamma in detail,<br/>
					as he has heard it,<br/>
					as he has mastered it -<br/>
					he spends the day in convincing<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> others of Dhamma;<br/>
					he neglects to go apart<br/>
					and devotes not himself to calm of purpose of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to convince,<br/>
					but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider the monk who gives in full a repetition of Dhamma,<br/>
					as he has heard it,<br/>
					as he has learned it -<br/>
					he spends the day in repeating it;<br/>
					he neglects to go apart<br/>
					and devotes not himself to calm of purpose of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to repeat,<br/>
					but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then consider the monk who turns his mind to Dhamma,<br/>
					ponders over it,<br/>
					reflects on it,<br/>
					as he has heard it,<br/>
					as he has learned it -<br/>
					he spends his day in thinking about Dhamma;<br/>
					he neglects to go apart<br/>
					and devotes not himself to calm of purpose of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to think,<br/>
					but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monk, take the case of the monk who masters Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">the sayings,<br/>
					psalms,<br/>
					catechisms,<br/>
					songs,<br/>
					solemnities,<br/>
					speeches,<br/>
					birth-stories,<br/>

					<p class="f4">and spends not the day in that mastery,<br/>
					neglects not to go apart<br/>
					and devotes himself <span class="f2 g"><b>[72]</b></span> to calm of purpose of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monk, such a monk is one who lives by Dhamma.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, thus, verily, have I declared one swift to master,<br/>
					one swift to convince,<br/>
					one swift to repeat,<br/>
					one swift to think<br/>
					and one who lives by Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> what should be done by a teacher for his disciples,<br/>

					<p class="f4">(Behold) these tree-roots,<br/>
