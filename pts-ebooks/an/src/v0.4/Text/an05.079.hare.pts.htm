					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five fears in the way,<br/>
					which have not yet arisen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for them;<br/>
					and, being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there will be, in the long road of the future,<br/>
					monks who have not made body become,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become;<br/>
					and those who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become<br/>
					will cause the acceptance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of others,<br/>
					and verily they will not be able to lead them<br/>
					in the way of higher virtue,<br/>
					higher mind,<br/>
					higher insight:<br/>
					and they too will become monks<br/>
					who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become;<br/>
					and those who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become;<br/>
					will cause the acceptance of others,<br/>
					and verily they will not be able to lead them<br/>
					in the way of higher virtue,<br/>
					higher mind,<br/>
					higher insight:<br/>
					and they too will become monks<br/>
					who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus verily, monks,<br/>
					from corrupt Dhamma<br/>
					comes corrupt Discipline;<br/>
					from corrupt Discipline<br/>
					corrupt Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the first fear in the way which,<br/>
					though not yet risen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>
					and being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become;<br/>
					will give guidance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> to others,<br/>
					and verily they will not be able to lead them<br/>
					in the way of higher virtue,<br/>
					higher mind,<br/>
					higher in- <span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span> sight<br/>
					and those too who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become;<br/>
					will give guidance to others,<br/>
					and verily they will not be able to lead them<br/>
					in the way of higher virtue,<br/>
					higher mind,<br/>
					higher insight:<br/>
					and they too will become monks<br/>
					who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thua verily, monks,<br/>
					from corrupt Dhamma<br/>
					comes corrupt Discipline;<br/>
					from corrupt Discipline<br/>
					corrupt Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the second fear in the way which,<br/>
					though not yet risen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>
					and being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become;<br/>
					when giving a talk on more-Dhamma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					or on the runes,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					will not be fully awake (to the meaning),<br/>
					but will enter on a state of darkness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus verily, monks,<br/>
					from corrupt Dhamma<br/>
					comes corrupt Discipline;<br/>
					from corrupt Discipline<br/>
					corrupt Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the third fear in the way which,<br/>
					though not yet risen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>
					and being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become;<br/>
					will not listen,<br/>
					lend an ear,<br/>
					set up an understanding mind<br/>
					or deem such things should be grasped and mastered,<br/>
					when those sayings,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					spoken by the Tathāgata,<br/>
					deep,<br/>
					deep in meaning,<br/>
					world-beyond,<br/>
					dealing with the void,<br/>
					are recited;<br/>
					but to the sayings of poets,<br/>
					mere poems,<br/>
					just a show of words and phrases,<br/>
					the works of outsiders,<br/>
					declaimed by their disciples —<br/>
					to such, when recited, they will listen,<br/>
					lend an ear,<br/>
					set up an understanding mind<br/>
					and deem such things should be grasped and mastered.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus indeed, monks,<br/>
					from corrupt Dhamma<br/>
					comes corrupt Discipline;<br/>
					from corrupt Discipline<br/>
					corrupt Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the fourth fear in the way which,<br/>
					though not yet risen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>
					and being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, there will be<br/>
					in the long road of the future<br/>
					monks who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become;<br/>
					and those elders who have not made body become,<br/>
					not made virtue become,<br/>
					not made mind become,<br/>
					not made insight become;<br/>
					will become luxurious,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

					to master the unmastered,<br/>
					to realize the unrealized;<br/>
					and the folk who come after them<br/>
					will fall into the way of (wrong) views:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					and they too will become luxurious,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus indeed, monks,<br/>
					from corrupt Dhamma<br/>
					comes corrupt Discipline;<br/>
					from corrupt Discipline<br/>
					corrupt Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the fifth fear in the way which,<br/>
