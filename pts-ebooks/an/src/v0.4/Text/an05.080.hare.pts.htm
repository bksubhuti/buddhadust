					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five fears in the way,<br/>
					which have not yet arisen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for them;<br/>
					and, being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there will be,<br/>
					in the long road of the future,<br/>
					monks who long for fine<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> robes;<br/>
					and they, with this longing,<br/>
					will leave the ways of wearing rags,<br/>
					will leave the forest wilderness,<br/>
					the out-land bed and seat;<br/>
					will move to village,<br/>
					town<br/>
					or rajah's capital<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and make their dwelling there;<br/>
					and because of a robe,<br/>
					they will commit many things<br/>
					unseemly,<br/>
					unfit.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the first fear in the way which,<br/>
					though not yet risen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>
					and being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, there will be,<br/>
					in the long road of the future,<br/>
					monks who will long for rich<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> alms-food;<br/>
					and they, with this longing,<br/>
					will leave the ways of the common round,<br/>
					the forest wilderness,<br/>
					the out-land bed and seat;<br/>
					will move to village,<br/>
					town<br/>
					or rajah's capital<br/>
					and make their dwelling there;<br/>
					seeking out, as it were<br/>
					with the tip of the tongue,<br/>
					tasty morsels;<br/>
					and because of alms-food,<br/>
					they will commit many things<br/>
					unseemly,<br/>
					unfit.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span> Monks, this is the second fear in the way which,<br/>
					though not yet risen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>
					and being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, there will be,<br/>
					in the long road of the future,<br/>
					monks who will long for a goodly bed and seat;<br/>
					and they, with this longing,<br/>
					will leave the ways of the tree-root abode,<br/>
					the forest wilderness,<br/>
					the out-land bed and seat;<br/>
					will move to village,<br/>
					town<br/>
					or rajah's capital<br/>
					and make their dwelling there;<br/>
					and because of a bed and seat,<br/>
					they will commit things<br/>
					unseemly,<br/>
					unfit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the third fear in the way which,<br/>
					though not yet risen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>
					and being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, there will be,<br/>
					in the long road of the future,<br/>
					monks who will live in company<br/>
					with nuns<br/>
					and novices in training;<br/>
					and when this shall be,<br/>
					it may be expected<br/>
					that the monks will take no delight<br/>
					in leading the godly life;<br/>
					and either they will commit some foul act<br/>
					or give up the training<br/>
					and return to the lower life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the fourth fear in the way which,<br/>
					though not yet risen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>
					and being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, there will be<br/>
					in the long road of the future<br/>
					monks who will live in company<br/>
					with the park folk<br/>
					and novices;<br/>
					and when this shall be,<br/>
					it may be expected<br/>
					that they will live and feast themselves<br/>
					on the plenty of hoarded stocks<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					and will mark out their lands and crops.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the fifth fear in the way which,<br/>
					though not yet risen,<br/>
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>
					and being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the five fears in the way,<br/>
					which have not yet arisen,<br/>
					which will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for them;<br/>
					and, being awake,<br/>
					strive to get rid of them.</p>
