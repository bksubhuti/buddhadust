					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if an elder monk be possessed of five qualities,<br/>
					among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					he becomes neither dear<br/>
					nor pleasant<br/>
					nor respected<br/>
					nor what he ought to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not free of passion,<br/>
					nor of corruption,<br/>
					nor of infatuation,<br/>
					and is full of cant<br/>
					and deceit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if he be possessed of these five qualities,<br/>
					among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					he becomes neither dear<br/>
					nor pleasant<br/>
					nor respected<br/>
					nor what he ought to become.</p>
