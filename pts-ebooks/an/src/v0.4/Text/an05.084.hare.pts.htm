					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if an elder monk be possessed of five qualities,<br/>
					among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					he becomes neither dear<br/>
					nor pleasant<br/>
					nor respected<br/>
					nor what he ought to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">He is without faith,<br/>
					modesty,<br/>
					fear of blame,<br/>
					is lazy<br/>
					and lacks insight.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
