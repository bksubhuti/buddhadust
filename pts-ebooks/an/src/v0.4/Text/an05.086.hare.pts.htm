					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five qualities,<br/>
					among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					an elder becomes dear and pleasant,<br/>
					respected and what he ought to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a master of logical analysis;<br/>
					a master in analysing causal relations;<br/>
					a master of grammatical analysis;<br/>
					a master in analyzing things knowable;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					what things have to be done by his fellow-men,<br/>
					living the godly life,<br/>
					either great or small,<br/>
					therein he is able and active,<br/>
					alive to investigating such matters;<br/>
					ready to do and get them done.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessed of these five qualities,<br/>
					among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					an elder becomes dear and pleasant,<br/>
					respected and what he ought to become.</p>
