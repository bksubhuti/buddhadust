					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five qualities,<br/>
					the way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of an elder monk<br/>
					is not to the advantage of many folk,<br/>
					is not for the happiness of many folk,<br/>
					is not for the good of many folk;<br/>
					it is to the harm and ill of devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the elder,<br/>
					time-honoured<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> and long gone forth;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">well-known,<br/>

					with a great following of householders<br/>
					and those gone forth;</p>

					and medicaments for sickness;</p>

					<p class="f4">who is learned,<br/>
					has a retentive and well-stored mind,<br/>
					and those Dhammas,<br/>
					lovely in the beginning,<br/>

					the godly life of purity,<br/>

					with perverted vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">He turns away many folk from Saddhamma<br/>
