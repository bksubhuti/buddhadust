					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare has abridged this entire section with '(Just the opposite conditions' The text repeats in full' But whereas in the Pali the opposites are easily constructed by just applying 'na' to the previous, in English and especially in Hare's translation the opposites are not so easily formed. I have followed Hare as closely as possible, but some differences were impossible to avoid.</p>
