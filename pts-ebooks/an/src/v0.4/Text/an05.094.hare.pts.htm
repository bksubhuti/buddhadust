					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five abodes of comfort.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk, aloof from sensuous appetites,<br/>
					aloof from evil ideas,<br/>
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>
					which is born of solitude<br/>
					and is full of joy and ease.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>
					which is self-evolved,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					full of zest and ease,<br/>
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br/>
					mindful and self-possessed,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>
					and experiences in his being<br/>
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br/>
					'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away ease<br/>
					and by putting away ill,<br/>
					by the passing away of happiness and misery<br/>
					he was wont to feel,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					which is utter purity of mindfulness,<br/>
					which comes of disinterestedness<br/>
					and is free of ease and ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By the destruction of the cankers,<br/>
					he enters and abides in<br/>
					the realization of mind-emancipation<br/>
					and insight-emancipation,<br/>
					which is free of the cankers,<br/>
					fully comprehending those states himself,<br/>
					even in this world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the five abodes of comfort.'</p>
