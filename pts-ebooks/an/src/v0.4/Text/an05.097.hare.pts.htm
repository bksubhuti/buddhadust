					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five qualities<br/>
					a monk, cultivating awareness<br/>
					in breathing in and breathing out,<br/>
					will in no long time penetrate the immovable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

					<p class="f4">He is set on little,<br/>
					busied in little,<br/>
					frugal,<br/>
					well content with life's necessities;<br/>
					</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">taking food in little,<br/>
					he serves not his own belly;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">slothful in little,<br/>
					he is heedful in vigilance;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, such talk as is austere<br/>
					and a help to opening the heart;<br/>
					talk on wanting little,<br/>
					on contentment,<br/>
					on loneliness,<br/>
					on not keeping company,<br/>
					on strenuous endeavour,<br/>
					on virtue,<br/>
					on concentration,<br/>
					on insight,<br/>
					on emancipation<br/>
					and on the knowledge and vision of emancipation —<br/>
					that he can obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and he reflects on the mind as freed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessed of these five qualities<br/>
					cultivating awareness<br/>
					in breathing in and breathing out,<br/>
					will in no long time penetrate the immovable.</p>
