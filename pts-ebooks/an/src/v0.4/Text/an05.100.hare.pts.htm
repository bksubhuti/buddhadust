					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One was once staying near <i>Kosambī,</i><br/>
					in Ghosita Park;<br/>
					and at that time Kakudha,<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> a Koliyan<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> —<br/>
					the venerable Mahā Moggallāna's servitor —<br/>
					had just died<br/>
					and was reborn<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> in a mind-pictured body;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					and the form that he took<br/>
					was such that it filled two or three Magadhan village fields;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					yet that form caused suffering<br/>
					neither to him<br/>
					nor to another.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span> And Kakudha deva visited the venerable Mahā <span class="mozp">Moggallāna,</span><br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and stood at one side;<br/>
					and so standing,<br/>
					he spoke thus to the venerable one:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, in Devadatta has arisen this longing:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"It is I who will lead the Order of monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">—and, sir, with the rising of that thought<br/>
					Devadatta's psychic power has declined.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the deva, Kakudha;<br/>
					and having spoken so,<br/>
					he saluted the venerable Mahā Moggallāna and,<br/>
					keeping him on his right,<br/>
					disappeared thence.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then went the venerable Mahā Moggallāna<br/>
					to the Exalted One and,<br/>
					saluting him,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he told the Exalted One:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At this time, Venerable Sir, Kakudha, a Koliyan<br/>
					my servitor —<br/>
					has just died<br/>
					and was reborn in a mind-pictured body;<br/>
					and the form that he took<br/>
					was such that it filled two or three Magadhan village fields<br/>
					yet that form caused suffering<br/>
					neither to him<br/>

					<p class="f4">And Kakudha deva visited me saluted me and stood at one side;<br/>
					and so standing,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, in Devadatta has arisen this longing:</p>

					<p class="f4">—and, sir, with the rising of that thought Devadatta's psychic power has declined.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the deva, Kakudha;<br/>
					and having spoken so,<br/>
					he saluted me and,<br/>
					keeping me on his right,<br/>
					disappeared thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I came to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(And the Exalted One said:)</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, <span class="mozp">Moggallāna,</span><br/>
					have you with your mind<br/>
					so compassed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> the mind of Kakudha deva<br/>
					as to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever Kakudha deva says,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, I have so compassed the mind of Kakudha deva<br/>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="mozp">Moggallāna,</span> there are these five teachers found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case, <span class="mozp">Moggallāna,</span><br/>
					of some teacher whose ways are impure,<br/>
					but who thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am pure,<br/>
					pure are my ways,<br/>
					clean and stainless" —</p>

					<p class="f4">but his disciples know:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This worthy teacher is impure in his ways,<br/>
					but thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am pure,<br/>
					pure are my ways,<br/>
					clean and stainless'</p>

					<p class="f4">If we tell the householders,<br/>
					he will not like it;<br/>
					and how can we do what he will not like?</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is honoured<br/>
					by gifts of the requisites:<br/>
					the robe,<br/>
					alms,<br/>
					lodging<br/>
					and medicaments.</p>

					<p class="f4">What the self shall do,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Moggallana- <span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span>, the disciples ward such a teacher in his ways;<br/>
					and such a teacher<br/>
					expects this warding of his ways of his disciples.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Moggallāna, some teacher's mode of livelihood is not pure,<br/>
					but who thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am pure,<br/>

					clean and stainless" —</p>

					<p class="f4">but his disciples know:</p>

					but who thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am pure,<br/>

					clean and stainless" —</p>

					<p class="f4">but his disciples know:</p>
