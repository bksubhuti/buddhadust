					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> endowed with five qualities<br/>
					a monk is a recluse who graces recluses.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk is often asked<br/>
					to accept a robe,<br/>
					not seldom;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">—</p>

					<p class="f4">And with whomsoever he has fellowship in the godly life,<br/>
					often they act cordially toward him,<br/>
					not <span class="f2 g"><b>[101]</b></span> seldom;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the pains that arise from bile,<br/>
					or from phlegm,<br/>
					or from wind,<br/>
					or the union of humours,<br/>

					he suffers little from ill-health.</p>

					the emancipation of the mind,<br/>
