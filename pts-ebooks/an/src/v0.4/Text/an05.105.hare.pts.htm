					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five comfortable abodes.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, there is ever present in a monk<br/>
					amity in act of deed<br/>
					when among his fellows in the godly life,<br/>
					both in open and in secret;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">there is ever present in a monk<br/>
					amity in act of word<br/>
					when among his fellows in the godly life,<br/>
					both in open and in secret;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">there is ever present in a monk<br/>
					amity in act of mind<br/>
					when among his fellows in the godly life,<br/>
					both in open and in secret;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and those virtues,<br/>
					unbroken,<br/>
					without a rent,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					without blemish,<br/>
					bringing freedom,<br/>
					praised hy the wise,<br/>
					incorrupt<br/>
					and conducive to concentration —<br/>
					in such he lives,<br/>
					one in virtue,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					in open and in secret,<br/>
					among his fellows in the godly life;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and that view,<br/>
					which is Ariyan,<br/>
					saving,<br/>
					and leads the doer thereof<br/>
					to the utter destruction of Ill —<br/>
					in that he lives,<br/>
					one in view,<br/>
					in open and in secret,<br/>
					among his fellows in the godly life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five comfortable abodes.'</p>
