					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Kosambī in Ghosita Park;<br/>
					and there the venerable Ānanda came to him,<br/>
					saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, to what extent<br/>
					may the Order of monks,<br/>
					as they live,<br/>
					live comfortably?</p>

						

					<p class="f4">'When, Ānanda, a monk has achieved virtue by self<br/>
					and is no importuner<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of another<br/>
					as to more-virtue<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> —<br/>
					to that extent, Ānanda,<br/>
					may the Order,<br/>
					as they live,<br/>
					live comfortably.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'But, lord, might there be another way<br/>
					wherein the Order,<br/>
					as they live,<br/>
					may live comfortably?</p>

					<p class="f4">'There might be, Ānanda,' said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, Ānanda, a monk has achieved virtue by self<br/>
					and is no importuner <span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span> of another<br/>
					as to more-virtue,<br/>
					considers self<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					and does not consider another —<br/>
