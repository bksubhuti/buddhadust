					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five things<br/>
					a monk is fit to follow the ways of the forest-wildernesses,<br/>
					the outland bed and seat'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					abides restrained by the restraint of the Obligations,<br/>
					is perfected in conduct and habit,<br/>
					sees peril in the smallest fault,<br/>
					accepts the training<br/>
					and trains himself accordantly;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and he is learned,<br/>
					with a retentive and well-stored mind,<br/>
					and those things<br/>
					lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely in the end,<br/>
					setting forth in spirit and letter<br/>
					the godly life,<br/>
					perfect in its entirety,<br/>
					are learnt by him,<br/>
					resolved upon,<br/>
					made familiar by speech,<br/>
					pondered over in the mind,<br/>
					fully understood in theory;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					abiding in active energy,<br/>
					puts away all wrong things<br/>
					and takes to right things;<br/>
					steadfast and strenuous,<br/>
					he shirks not the burden of righteousness;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and he obtains at will,<br/>
					without trouble,<br/>
					without difficulty,<br/>
					both here and now,<br/>
					the abodes of ease:<br/>
					the fourfold musings,<br/>
					highly mental;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and enters and abides<br/>
					in the emancipation of the mind,<br/>
					in the emancipation of insight,<br/>
					which is free of the cankers,<br/>
					realizing this state by his own knowledge<br/>
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, possessed of these five things<br/>
					a monk is fit to follow the ways of the wildernesses,<br/>
					the outland bed and seat.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> See <i>Breath.</i> p. xl. <i>Comy.</i> says a <i>khīṇāsava</i> is referred to.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The text does net give in full; see above, § 2. Nyāṇatiloka renders <i>besitzt Willenskraft,</i> which gives India a term she did not possess, though Gotama used his best substitutes. <i>Viriya,</i> 'effort,' 'energy,' is a <i>mode of using</i> will.</p>
