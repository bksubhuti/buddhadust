					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> This formula recurs at A. i, 100, 299; ii, 257; iii, 278, 452; iv, 148, 349, 456; v, 310, in respect of 'two' dhammā: things, conditions or qualities and so forth to 'eleven.' Sometimes the editors of the <i>Roman</i> texts show the formula as though one sutta were intended - e.g., A. i, 100 - and sometimes as above with the abbreviation mark. I venture to suggest that there are 4,250 suttas intended with this formula, thus: (17 X 10)X 1, 1, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, and 1 respectively, and that the statement at the end of A. v, p. 361, that the <i>Anguttara Nikāya</i> contains 9,557 - and this is confirmed in the Comys. AA. i, 3 and DA. i, 23, also Exp. i, 32 - is not far short of the mark, pace Hardy, A. v, p. vi.</p>
