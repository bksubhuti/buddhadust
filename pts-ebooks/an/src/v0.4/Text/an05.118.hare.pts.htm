					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, pursuing five courses<br/>
					a nun is surely cast into hell as a reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Without testing or plumbing the matter,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					she speaks in praise of the unpraiseworthy;<br/>
					without testing or plumbing the matter,<br/>
					she speaks in dispraise of the praiseworthy;<br/>
					she is wrong in views;<br/>
					she is wrong in purpose;<br/>
					and she rejects the gift of faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, pursuing these five courses<br/>
					a nun is surely cast into hell as a reward.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, pursuing five courses<br/>
					a nun is surely set in heaven as a reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">After testing and plumbing the matter,<br/>
					she speaks in praise of the praiseworthy,<br/>
					after testing and plumbing the matter,<br/>
					she speaks in dispraise of the unpraiseworthy;<br/>
					she has right views;<br/>
					she is right in purpose;<br/>
					and she accepts the gift of faith.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare abridges this entire sutta with '...she is wrong in views, wrong in purpose, and rejects the gift of faith.' I have reconstructed the sutta using the AN  5.116 and the Pali.</p>
