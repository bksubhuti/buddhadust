					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On one occasion, when he was staying near Veaālī, at the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana, the Exalted One, arising from seclusion at eventide, visited the hall of the sick.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One saw a monk, weak and ailing;<br/>
					and at the sight he sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was seated, the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if five things forsake not anyone weak and ailing,<br/>
					for him this may be expected:</p>

					<p class="f4">Ere long,<br/>
					by destroying the cankers,<br/>
					he will enter and abide in<br/>
					the emancipation of mind,<br/>
					the emancipation of insight,<br/>
					which is free of cankers,<br/>
					realizing this by his own knowledge<br/>
					even both here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk abides<br/>
					seeing nothing attractive in the body;<br/>
					is conscious of the cloying of food;<br/>
					conscious of distaste as to the world;<br/>
					perceives impermanence in the compounded;<br/>
					and his inner self is well set<br/>
					on the thought of death.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if these five things forsake not anyone weak and ailing,<br/>
					for him this may be expected:</p>

					<p class="f4">Ere long,<br/>
					by destroying the cankers,<br/>
					he will enter and abide in<br/>
					the emancipation of mind,<br/>
					the emancipation of insight,<br/>
					which is free of cankers,<br/>
					realizing this by his own knowledge<br/>
					even both here and now.</p>
