					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare's construction of these goes: "...the cankers, born of doing amiss, are discovered; born of dejection they wax...". This creates problems in the following sections which he has abridged with the indication that this pattern should be followed. I have altered his rendering to parallel the Pali.</p>
