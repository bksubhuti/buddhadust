					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, while he dwelt near Vesālī,<br/>
					at the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana,<br/>
					the Exalted One early one morning,<br/>
					after dressing,<br/>
					took bowl and robe<br/>
					and entered Vesālī for alms.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Nöw at that time<br/>
					about five hundred Licchavis were met<br/>
					and seated at Sārandada<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> shrine<br/>
					and this chance talk occurred:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rarely are the five treasures<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely is the elephant treasure<br/>
					revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely the horse treasure<br/>
					revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely the the jewel treasure<br/>
					revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely the the woman treasure<br/>
					revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely the rarely the householder<br/>
					treasure revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely are these five treasures<br/>
					revealed in the world.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now these Licchavis had put a man in the road, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, my man, you see the Exalted One coming along,<br/>
					come and tell us."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the man saw the Exalted One<br/>
					a good way off coming along,<br/>
					and went and told the Licchavis, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sirs,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> here comes this same Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened;<br/>
					and now is the time<br/>
					to do what you meant!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Licchavis approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and stood at one side;<br/>
					and so standing they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, <span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span> it were good<br/>
					if the Exalted One were to visit Sārandada shrine<br/>
					out of compassion!'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One accepted in silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had come to the shrine,<br/>
					he sat down on the seat they had made ready;<br/>
					and so seated<br/>
					he said this to the Licchavis:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What talked ye of, 0 Licchavis,<br/>
					as ye sat here together just now;<br/>
					what talk between you was interrupted?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, as we sat together<br/>
					the talk turned on how rarely the five treasures<br/>
					are revealed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely is the elephant treasure<br/>
					revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely the horse treasure<br/>
					revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely the the jewel treasure<br/>
					revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely the the woman treasure<br/>
					revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rarely the rarely the householder<br/>

					<p class="f4">Rarely are these five treasures<br/>
