					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five things<br/>
					lead to the falling away<br/>
					of a monk who is occasionally released.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Delight in (body) work,<br/>
					delight in gossip,<br/>
					delight in sleep,<br/>
					delight in unguarded doors of the senses,<br/>
					no moderation in eating.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these five things<br/>
					lead to the falling away<br/>
					of a monk who is occasionally released.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five things<br/>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Non-delight in (body) work,<br/>
					non-delight in gossip,<br/>
					non-delight in sleep,<br/>
					non-delight in unguarded doors of the senses,<br/>
					and moderation in eating.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these five things<br/>
