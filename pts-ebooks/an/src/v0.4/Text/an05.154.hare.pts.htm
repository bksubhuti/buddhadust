					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five things<br/>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, carelessly<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the monks hear Dhamma;<br/>
					carelessly they master it;<br/>
					carelessly they bear it in mind;<br/>
					carelessly they test the good of the things borne in mind;<br/>
					knowing the good and knowing Dhamma,<br/>
					carelessly they go their ways in Dhamma by Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five things<br/>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, carefully the monks hear Dhamma;<br/>
					carefully they master it;<br/>
