					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five things<br/>
					lead to the confounding,<br/>
					the disappearance of Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the monks master not Dhamma:<br/>
					the sayings, psalms, catechisms, songs, solemnities, speeches, birth-stories, marvels, runes.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the first thing<br/>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the third thing<br/>
					that leads to the confounding,<br/>
					the disappearance of Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">They make no repetition of it in detail,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, the monks do not in their hearts<br/>
