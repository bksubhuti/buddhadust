					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five things<br/>
					lead to the confounding,<br/>
					the disappearance of Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the monks master an ill-grasped saying,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					ill-arranged as to word and letter;<br/>
					monks, when it is so ill-arranged,<br/>
					the meaning<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> also is an ill deduction.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the first thing<br/>
