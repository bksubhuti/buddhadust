					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'Monks, there are these five ways of putting away malice<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					whereby all malice arisen in a monk<br/>
					ought to be put away.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in whatsoever person malice is engendered,<br/>
					in him amity ought to be made to become more.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>
					in him pity ought to be made to become more.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>
					in him poise ought to be made to become more.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>
					in that man<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> unmindfulness,<br/>
					inattention to it,<br/>
					ought to be brought about.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>
					in that man the fact that he is of his own making<br/>
					ought to be fixed in his mind;<br/>
					and he should think:</p>

						

					<p class="f4">'This,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> reverend sir,<br/>
					is of one's own making,<br/>
					the heir to deeds,<br/>
					deeds are the matrix,<br/>
					deeds are the kin,<br/>
					deeds are the foundation;<br/>
					whatever one does,<br/>
					good or bad,<br/>
					one will become heir to that.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five ways of putting away malice<br/>
					whereby all malice arisen in a monk<br/>
					ought to be put away.'</p>
