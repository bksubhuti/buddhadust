					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>The Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>'Monks.'</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>'Yes, lord,' they replied, and the Exalted One said:</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>'Monks, there are these five ways of putting away malice<br/>
							whereby all malice arisen in a monk<br/>
							ought to be put away.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>What five?</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>Monks, in whatsoever person malice is engendered,<br/>
							in him amity ought to be made to become more.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>'Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>
							in him pity ought to be made to become more.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>'Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>
							in him poise ought to be made to become more.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>
							in that man unmindfulness,<br/>
							inattention to it,<br/>
							ought to be brought about.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>
							in that man the fact that he is of his own making<br/>
							ought to be fixed in his mind;<br/>
							and he should think:</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>'This, reverend sir,<br/>
							is of one's own making,<br/>
							the heir to deeds,<br/>
							deeds are the matrix,<br/>
							deeds are the kin,<br/>
							deeds are the foundation;<br/>
							whatever one does,<br/>
							good or bad,<br/>
							one will become heir to that.'</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>Verily, monks, these are the five ways of putting away malice<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now of him whose ways are impure in deed,<br/>
