					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sirs.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sir,' they replied;<br/>
					and Sāriputta said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein, sirs, a monk,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If here among visible things<br/>
					he make<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> not the gain of gnosis,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken,<br/>
					the venerable Udāyin said<br/>
					to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not so, venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span> nor happens it,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time Sāriputta said:</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time, when he had thus spoken,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time Sāriputta said:</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">And he went to where the Exalted One was and saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">And so the venerable Sāriputta was silent.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the venerable Udāyin and said;</p>

					<p class="f4">'But who, do you hold,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> Udāyin, has a mind-pictured body?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span>'Those devas, lord, who are formless,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Why think thou, Udāyin,<br/>
					that the word of a witless fool like thee<br/>
					is just the thing to declare?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the Venerable Ānanda thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it possible,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> Ānanda,<br/>
					that you can look on with indifference<br/>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Ānanda,<br/>
					compassion grows not<br/>
					from (suffering) an elder monk to be vexed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein, monks, a monk,<br/>
					who has achieved virtue,<br/>
					achieved concentration,<br/>
					achieved insight,<br/>
					may both completely enter<br/>
					the ending of perception and feeling<br/>

					<p class="f4">If here among visible things<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One;<br/>
					and when he had thus spoken,<br/>
					the Well-Gone arose and entered the dwelling.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of the Exalted One,<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda went up to the venerable Upavāna<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just now, venerable Upavāna,<br/>
					some (monks) were vexing the elder monk<br/>
					and we never protested unto them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore wonder not, venerable sir,<br/>
					should the Exalted One,<br/>
					after coming from seclusion,<br/>
					bring<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> the matter up<br/>
					and<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> relate the whole affair<br/>
					to the venerable Upavāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Already even fearfulness<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> is come upon us.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And in the evening,<br/>
					after coming from seclusion,<br/>
					the Exalted One went to the service hall,<br/>
					and, when come, he sat down on <span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span> the seat that was ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the venerable Upavāna:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Having how many qualities, Upavāna,<br/>
					does an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					become pious,<br/>
					loved,<br/>
					respected<br/>
					and what he ought to become?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, having five<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> qualities,<br/>
					an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					becomes pious,<br/>
					loved,<br/>
					respected<br/>
					and what he ought to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, herein he is virtuous,<br/>
					abides restrained by the restraint of the Obligations,<br/>
					is perfect in conduct and habit,<br/>
					sees peril in the smallest fault,<br/>
					accepts the training<br/>
					and trains himself accordantly;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he is learned,<br/>
					with mind retentive and well stored;<br/>
					those things lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely in the end,<br/>
					which set forth in spirit and in letter<br/>
					the godly life of purity,<br/>
					perfect in its entirety —<br/>
					those are fully learnt by him,<br/>
					resolved upon,<br/>
					made familiar by speech,<br/>
					pondered over in the mind,<br/>
					fully understood in theory.;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he has a pleasant voice,<br/>
					a good enunciation,<br/>
					is urbane in speech,<br/>
					distinct,<br/>
					free from hoarseness<br/>
					and informative;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">at will,<br/>
					easily and without trouble,<br/>
					he attains to the four states of musing,<br/>
					which bring comfort<br/>
					both here and now,<br/>
					transcending thought;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">by destroying the cankers<br/>
					he enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart<br/>
					and of insight,<br/>
					which is free of the cankers,<br/>
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br/>
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, lord, having these five qualities<br/>
					an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					becomes pious,<br/>
					loved,<br/>
					respected<br/>
					and what he ought to become.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well (said), well (said), Upavāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is even (as you say): having these five qualities<br/>
					an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					becomes pious,<br/>
					loved,<br/>
					respected<br/>
					and what he ought to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">If these five qualities are not completely found in an elder,<br/>
					will his fellows in the godly life respect,<br/>
					honour,<br/>
					reverence<br/>
					and venerate him<br/>
					for his broken teeth,<br/>
					his grey hairs,<br/>
					his wrinkled skin?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But verily, Upavāna, when these five things are found in an elder,<br/>
					then his fellows in the godly life respect him,<br/>
					honour,<br/>
					reverence<br/>
					and venerate him.'</p>
