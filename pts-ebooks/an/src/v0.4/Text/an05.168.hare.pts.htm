					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sirs.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sir,' they replied;<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sirs, for the wicked,<br/>

					right concentration is perforce destroyed;</p>
