					<p class="f4">Now the householder, Anāthapiṇḍika, visited the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and the Exalted One spoke to the householder,<br/>
					thus seated,<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Householder, he who has not got rid<br/>
					of the five dread hatreds<br/>
					is called virtueless<br/>
					and arises in hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Taking life,<br/>
					taking what is not given,<br/>
					fleshly lusts,<br/>
					lying<br/>
					and indulgence in spirituous liquor that cause indolence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, he who has not got rid<br/>
