					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the householder Anāthapiṇḍika,<br/>
					surrounded by about five hundred lay disciples,<br/>
					visited the Exalted One and,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and said;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sāriputta, any white-frocked home-man<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> you know,<br/>
					who acts controlled<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					in the five steps of the training<br/>
					and obtains at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					the four<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> very purposive abodes of ease,<br/>
					here amid things seen,<br/>
					may, should he desire,<br/>
					declare just the (state of) self<br/>
					by the self,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed' is hell for me;<br/>
					destroyed is animal-rebirth;<br/>
					destroyed is the realm of ghosts;<br/>
					destroyed for me is the wayward way,<br/>
					the ill way,<br/>
					the abyss;<br/>
					I am he who has won to the Stream,<br/>
					not subject to any falling away,<br/>
					sure<br/>
					and bound for enlightenment."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">He acts controlled<br/>
					in what five steps of the training?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Sāriputta, the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					abstains from taking life,<br/>
					from taking what is not given,<br/>
					from fleshly lusts,<br/>
					from lying<br/>
					and from drinking spirituous liquors<br/>
					that cause indolence.</p>

					<p class="f4">He acts controlled<br/>
					in these five steps of the training.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four abodes of ease,<br/>
					very purposive,<br/>
					he obtains at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					here amid things seen?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Sāriputta, the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					has unwavering faith in the Buddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a truth he is that,<br/>
					the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened,<br/>
					walking in knowledge,<br/>
					well gone,<br/>
					wise in the ways of the worlds,<br/>
					with none greater,<br/>
					tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					teacher of devas and men,<br/>
					Buddha,<br/>
					lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first<br/>
					very purposive abode of ease,<br/>
					won, here amid things seen,<br/>
					by purifying impure thought,<br/>
					by cleansing unclean thought.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Sāriputta, the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					has unwavering faith in Dhamma;</p>

					<p class="f4">Well declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma,<br/>
					one to be seen here and now,<br/>
					not for other times,<br/>
					bidding one <span class="f2 g"><b>[156]</b></span> come and see,<br/>
					a guide to be understood by wise men,<br/>
					each for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second<br/>
					very purposive abode of ease,<br/>
					won, here amid things seen,<br/>
					by purifying impure thought,<br/>
					by cleansing unclean thought.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering faith in the Order;</p>

					<p class="f4">Well trained<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of disciples;<br/>
					trained in uprightness<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Oder of disciples;<br/>
					trained in method<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of disciples;<br/>

					is the Exalted One's Order of disciples —<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight male persons —<br/>
					this is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					a field for merit,<br/>
					none greater in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third<br/>
					very purposive abode of ease,<br/>
					won, here amid things seen,<br/>
					by purifying impure thought,<br/>
					by cleansing unclean thought.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Sāriputta, the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is possessed of virtues<br/>
					beloved by Ariyans —<br/>
					whole,<br/>
					unbroken,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					without blemish,<br/>
					bringing freedom,<br/>
					praised by wise men,<br/>
					incorrupt,<br/>
					conducive to concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth<br/>
					very purposive abode of ease,<br/>
					won, here amid things seen,<br/>
					by purifying impure thought,<br/>
					by cleansing unclean thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four abodes of ease,<br/>
					very purposive,<br/>
					he obtains at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					here amid things seen</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, any white-frocked home-man you know,<br/>
					who acts controlled<br/>
					in these five steps of the training<br/>
					and obtains at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty,<br/>
					these four very purposive abodes of ease,<br/>
					here amid things seen,<br/>
