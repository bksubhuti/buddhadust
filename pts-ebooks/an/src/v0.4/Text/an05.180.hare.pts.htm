					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[158]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One with<br/>
					a great following of monks<br/>
					walked a walk among the Kosalans.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as the Exalted One went along the highway<br/>
					he saw a place where grew a big grove of sal trees;<br/>
					and seeing it there,<br/>
					he moved down from the road<br/>
					and went towards it<br/>
					and made his way among the trees;<br/>
					and at a certain place<br/>
					he smiled.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What cause now,<br/>
					what reason<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					moved the Exalted One to show a smile?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not for nothing<br/>
					do Tathāgatas smile.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda asked him<br/>
					concerning the matter:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What cause now,<br/>
					what reason<br/>
					moved the Exalted One to show a smile?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not for nothing<br/>
					do Tathāgatas smile.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(Then said the Exalted One:)</p>

					<p class="f4">'At this place, Ānanda,<br/>
					in olden times<br/>
					there was a rich and flourishing city<br/>
					thronged with many people;<br/>
					and by the city, Ānanda,<br/>
					there dwelt the Exalted One, Kassapa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened;<br/>
					and Gavesin was a lay-disciple<br/>
					of the Exalted One, Kassapa;<br/>
					but he kept not the moral precepts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Now because of Gavesin<br/>
					there were about five hundred who testified<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					and were stirred to discipleship,<br/>
					but they kept not the moral precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought he:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have greatly served these five hundred lay-disciples,<br/>
					being the first to move and bestir myself;<br/>
					yet I keep not the moral precepts<br/>
					nor do these five hundred others.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a levelling of levels,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					leaving no whit of a more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'm for something more!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So Gavesin went up to the five hundred<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Know, good sirs,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					from today<br/>
					that I keep the moral precepts."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, those five hundred<br/>
					thought to themselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, Master Gavesin has greatly served us,<br/>
					being first to move and bestir himself,<br/>
					and this same Master Gavesin<br/>
					will <span class="f2 g"><b>[159]</b></span> now keep the moral precepts —<br/>
					why then not we too?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then went those five hundred lay-disciples to Gavesin<br/>
					and told him that they too<br/>
					henceforth<br/>
					would keep the moral precepts.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again thought Gavesin:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have greatly served these five hundred lay-disciples,<br/>
					being the first to move and bestir myself;<br/>
					being the first to keep the moral precepts,<br/>
					and now they too keep the moral precepts,<br/>
					but I do not follow the celibate's life,<br/>
					the life remote,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					giving up sex-life,<br/>
					common among men,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>
					nor do these five hundred others.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a levelling of levels,<br/>
					leaving no whit of a more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'm for something more!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So Gavesin went up to the five hundred<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Know, good sirs,<br/>

					I follow the celibate's life,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, those five hundred<br/>

					why then not we too?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then went those five hundred lay-disciples to Gavesin<br/>
					and told him that they too<br/>
					henceforth<br/>
					would follow the celibate's life,<br/>
					the life remote,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again thought Gavesin:</p>

					and now they too follow the celibate's life,<br/>
					the life remote,<br/>
					giving up sex-life,<br/>

					but I am not a one-mealer<br/>
					abstaining from night-eating,<br/>
					giving up eating at wrong times<br/>
					nor are these five hundred others.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a levelling of levels,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then went those five hundred lay-disciples to Gavesin<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the lay-disciple Gavesin considered thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have greatly served these five hundred lay-disciples,<br/>
					being the first to move and bestir myself;<br/>
					being the first to keep the moral precepts,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This is a levelling of levels,<br/>
					leaving no whit of a more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'm for something more!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda,<br/>
					the lay-disciple Gavesin<br/>
					went to the Exalted One, Kassapa,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened,<br/>
					and, having come,<br/>
					said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, grant that I may go forth beside the Exalted One;<br/>
					grant me full acceptance!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> —<br/>
					and Gavesin,<br/>
					the lay-disciple,<br/>
					obtained permission to go forth beside Kassapa,<br/>
					the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened;<br/>
					he obtained full acceptance.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[160]</b></span> Now not long after his acceptance, Ānanda,<br/>
					Gavesin the monk,<br/>
					living alone,<br/>
					withdrawn,<br/>

					entered into and abode in<br/>

					clansmen's sons rightly go forth from the home<br/>

					and he declared:</p>

					<p class="f4">Destroyed is birth,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thereafter, Ānanda,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought those five hundred lay-disciples:</p>

					and this same Master Gavesin<br/>
					now has had his hair and beard shaved off,<br/>
					donned the yellow robe,<br/>
					and goes forth from the home to the homeless life;<br/>
					why then not we too?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And those five hundred lay-disciples, Ānanda,<br/>
					went and begged the Exalted One, Kassapa,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Grant, lord, that we may go forth beside the Exalted One;<br/>

					- and those five hundred<br/>

					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened;<br/>
					obtained full acceptance.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought the monk Gavesin:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, verily, can obtain<br/>
					this unsurpassed bliss of liberation<br/>
					at will,<br/>
					easily,<br/>
					and without difficulty;<br/>
					would that these five hundred monks<br/>
					could obtain this bliss<br/>
					at will,<br/>
					easily,<br/>
					and without difficulty!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, those five hundred monks<br/>
					abode alone,<br/>
					withdrawn,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus verily, Ānanda,<br/>
