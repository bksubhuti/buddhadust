					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> ancient brāhman things<br/>
					are now seen in dogs,<br/>
					but not in brāhmans.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in former times<br/>
					brāhmans approached only a <i>brāhmaṇī,</i><br/>
					never a non-brāhmaṇī;<br/>
					now they go to brāhmaṇī<br/>
					and non-brāhmaṇī alike.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, today dogs go to dogs only,<br/>
					never to other creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the first ancient brāhman thing<br/>
					now seen in dogs,<br/>
					not in brāhmans.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in former times<br/>
					brāhmans approached a brāhmaṇī only in season,<br/>
					never at other times;<br/>
					now they go to a brāhmaṇī<br/>
					both in and out of season.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, today dogs go to dogs only in season,<br/>
					never at other times.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the second ancient brāhman thing<br/>
					now seen in dogs,<br/>
					not in brāhmans.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in former times<br/>
					brāhmans neither bought nor sold a brāhmaṇī,<br/>
					but, consorting just where affection was mutual,<br/>
					fostered concord;<br/>
					now they both buy and sell brāhmaṇīs,<br/>
					and consort where affection is mutual.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, today dogs neither buy nor sell dogs,<br/>
					but consort just where affection is mutual<br/>
					and foster concord.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the third ancient brāhman thing<br/>
					now seen in dogs,<br/>
					not in brāhmans.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in former times<br/>
					brāhmans hoarded neither treasure,<br/>
					grain,<br/>
					silver<br/>
					nor gold;<br/>
					now they hoard treasure,<br/>
					grain,<br/>
					silver<br/>
					and gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, today dogs hoard neither treasure,<br/>
					grain,<br/>
					silver,<br/>
					nor gold.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span> This, monks, is the fourth ancient brāhman thing<br/>
					now seen in dogs,<br/>
					not in brāhmans.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in former times<br/>
					brāhmans sought food for the evening meal<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					in the evening,<br/>
					for the morning meal<br/>
					in the morning;<br/>
					now, after cramming their bellies to the uttermost,<br/>
					they take away the remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, today dogs seek food for the evening meal<br/>
					in the evening,<br/>
					for the morning meal<br/>
					in the morning.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the filth ancient brāhman thing<br/>
					now seen in dogs,<br/>
					not in brāhmans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five ancient brāhman things<br/>
					now seen in dogs,<br/>
					but not in brāhmans.</p>
