					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once dwelling near Vesālī,<br/>
					at the Gabled Hall,<br/>
					in Mahāvana,<br/>
					some five hundred Licchavis had gathered round to honour him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> some were dark, dark-skinned, in dark clothes clad, darkly adorned;<br/>
					and some were fair, fair-skinned, in fair clothes clad, fairly adorned;<br/>
					and some were ruddy, red-skinned, in russet clad, in red adorned;<br/>
					and some were white, pale-skinned, in white clothes clad, in white adorned;<br/>
					but of a truth the Exalted One, in grace and glory, outshone them all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now brāhman Pingiyānin rose from his seat, girt his upper robe about his shoulder, bent forth his outstretched hands to the Exalted One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> has been revealed to me, 0 Blessed One;<br/>
					it has been revealed to me, 0 Well-gone!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Speak thou that thing, Pingiyānin said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then brāhman Pingiyānin extolled the Exalted One before his face in this same verse:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Sweet though at dawn red lotus-lilies blow,<br/>
							'Tis sweeter in full bloom their blossoms grow:<br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span> Lo! see Angīrasa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> illuminant,<br/>
							Like as the midday sun, all radiant.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Licchavis presented brāhman Pingiyānin with five hundred upper robes<br/>
					and brāhman Pingiyānin presented them to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to those Licchavis:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Five,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> 0 licchavis, are the treasures rarely revealed in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, arahant, fully enlightened,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> is rarely revealed in the world;<br/>
					rare in the world is one able to teach the Tathāgata-declared Dhamma-discipline;<br/>
					rare is one able to recognize the teaching,<br/>
					declared by the Tathāgata;<br/>
					rare is one who steps his way in Dhamma by Dhamma,<br/>
					recognizing the teaching of the Tathāgata-declared Dhamma-discipline;<br/>
					rare in the world is a person grateful and thankful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, 0 Licchavis, these are the five treasures<br/>
					rarely revealed in the world.'</p>
