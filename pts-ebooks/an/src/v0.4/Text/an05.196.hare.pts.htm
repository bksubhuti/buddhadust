					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Bodhisatta</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> These five are referred to at <i>J.</i> i, 69; see Thomas' Life, 70 n. Our <i>Comy.</i> observes that there are four dream-causes: (1) body-disturbances, due to bile, producing dreams such as falling from a precipice or flying or being chased by a beast or robber; (2) previous happenings; (3) being deva-possessed, and devas bring thoughts both for one's good and otherwise; (4) premonitions; this last is the Bodhisat's. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Milinda,</i> Dilemma 75 (p. 297).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Ohita</i> (Thomas <i>loc. cit.</i>), 'plunged,' but <i>Comy.</i> <i>na udakasmiṃ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Thomas, 'hand,' but the Pāli is <i>nābhi</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> <i>dabbha,</i> kusa grass.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> <i>Sammā-sambodhi.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> <i>Abhisambodha.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> I give a literal trsl. of the five; the meaning no doubt is that the Bodhisat so interpreted the dreams.</p>
