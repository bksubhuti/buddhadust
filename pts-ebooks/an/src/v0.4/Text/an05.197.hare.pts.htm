					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five stays<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> to rain,<br/>
					and seers know not the signs thereof,<br/>
					nor can their eyes penetrate there.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when above in the sky<br/>
					the fiery element rages,<br/>
					the pent up storm clouds part their ways —<br/>
					this, monks, is the first stay to rain,<br/>
					and seers know not the sign thereof,<br/>
					nor can their eyes penetrate there.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when above in the sky<br/>
					the windy element rages,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span> the pent up storm clouds part their ways —<br/>
					this, monks, is the second stay to rain,<br/>
					and seers know not the sign thereof,<br/>
					nor can their eyes penetrate there.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when Rāhu,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the Asura king,<br/>
					gathers water with his hand<br/>
					and spills it into the mighty ocean —<br/>
					this, monks, is the third stay to rain,<br/>
					and seers know not the sign thereof,<br/>
					nor can their eyes penetrate there.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when the rain-cloud devas are indolent —<br/>
					this, monks, is the fourth stay to rain,<br/>
					and seers know not the sign thereof,<br/>
					nor can their eyes penetrate there.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, when men are not Dhamma-doers —<br/>
					this is the fifth stay to rain,<br/>
					and seers know not the sign thereof,<br/>
					nor can their eyes penetrate there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five stays to rain,<br/>
					and seers know not the signs thereof,<br/>
					nor can their eyes penetrate there.'</p>
