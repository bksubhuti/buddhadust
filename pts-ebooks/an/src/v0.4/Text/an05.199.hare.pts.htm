					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, when virtuous world-forsakers approach a family,<br/>
					men there in five ways<br/>
					beget much merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when virtuous world-forsakers approach,<br/>
					men, seeing them,<br/>
					make calm their hearts;<br/>
					monks, that leads heavenward<br/>
					and the family then<br/>
					has stepped a step along the way.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Or when virtuous world-forsakers approach,<br/>
					men stand up,<br/>
					salute<br/>
					and offer a seat;<br/>
					monks, that leads to birth in higher rank<br/>
					and the family then<br/>
					has stepped a step along the way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or when virtuous world-forsakers approach,<br/>
					men rid themselves<br/>
					of all stain of meanness;<br/>
