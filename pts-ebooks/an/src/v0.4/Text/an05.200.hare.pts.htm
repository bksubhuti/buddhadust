					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five elements of escape.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> take the case of a monk<br/>

					at lustful thoughts,<br/>
					yet becomes not calm,<br/>

					nor feels he that feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is declared to be the escape from lusts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, take the case of a monk who thinks on form<br/>

					<span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span> but whose heart<br/>
