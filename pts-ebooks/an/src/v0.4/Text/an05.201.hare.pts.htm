					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once,<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> when the Exalted One was staying in the Bamboo Grove<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> near Kimbila,<br/>
					the venerable Kimbila visited him and,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, what is the cause,<br/>
					what is the reason,<br/>
					whereby, when the Exalted One has passed away completely,<br/>
					Saddhamma does not become long-lasting?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose, Kimbila, after the Tathāgata has passed away completely,<br/>
					the monks and the nuns,<br/>
					the lay disciples both men and women,<br/>
					live without<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> reverence,<br/>
					without heed <span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span> for the Teacher;<br/>
					without reverence, without heed for Dhamma<br/>
					without reverence, without heed for the Order.<br/>
					without reverence, without heed for the training;<br/>
					without reverence, without heed for one another -<br/>
					this is the cause,<br/>
					this is the reason,<br/>
					whereby, when the Tathāgata has passed away completely,<br/>
					Saddhamma does not become long-lasting.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">'And what, lord, is the cause,<br/>
					the reason,<br/>
					whereby, after the Tathāgata has passed away,<br/>
					Saddhamma becomes long-lasting?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose, Kimbila, monks, nuns<br/>
					and lay-disciples<br/>
					revere and give heed to the Teacher,<br/>
					revere and give heed to the Dhamma,<br/>
					revere and give heed to the Order,<br/>
					revere and give heed to the training;<br/>
					revere and give heed to one another -<br/>
					this is the cause,<br/>
					the reason,<br/>
					whereby, when the Tathāgata has passed away,<br/>
					Saddhamma becomes long-lasting.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Cf. <i>A.</i> iv, 84, where this sutta recurs of 'seven'; also <i>K.S.</i> ii, 152; V, 151.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> observes that he was a <i>'chetty's'</i> (<i>seṭṭhi,</i> banker) son in that city. <i>S.e.</i> and <i>Comy.</i> read <i>Nicelu-vane</i> for our <i>Veḷu-vane,</i> explaining: <i>Mucalinda-;</i> see <i>UdA.</i> 100. <i>Cf.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> says they will go to a shrine with umbrellas up, sandals on, chattering; they will sleep or talk when there is preaching; they will gesticulate in the midst of the Order; they will not fulfil the training; they will fight and quarrel with one another.</p>
