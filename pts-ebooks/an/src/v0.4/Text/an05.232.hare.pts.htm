					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk in residence<br/>
					follow the course of five things,<br/>
					he becomes among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					pious <span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span> and pleasing,<br/>
					respected<br/>
					and what he ought to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">He becomes virtuous,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					abides restrained by the restraint of the Obligations,<br/>
					is perfect in conduct and habit,<br/>
					sees peril in the smallest fault,<br/>
					accepts the training<br/>
					and trains himself accordantly.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is learned,<br/>
					with mind retentive and well stored;<br/>
					those things lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely in the end,<br/>
					which set forth in spirit and in letter<br/>
					the godly life of purity,<br/>
					perfect in its entirety —<br/>
					those are fully learnt by him,<br/>
					resolved upon,<br/>
					made familiar by speech,<br/>
					pondered over in the mind,<br/>
					fully understood in theory.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He has a pleasant voice,<br/>
					a good enunciation,<br/>
					is urbane in speech,<br/>
					distinct,<br/>
					free from hoarseness<br/>
					and informative.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">At will,<br/>
					easily and without trouble,<br/>
					he attains to the four states of musing,<br/>
					which bring comfort<br/>
					both here and now,<br/>
					transcending thought.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By destroying the cankers<br/>
					he enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart<br/>
					and of insight,<br/>
					which is free of the cankers,<br/>
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br/>
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks,if a monk in residence<br/>
					follow the course of five things,<br/>
					he becomes among his fellows in the godly life<br/>
					pious and pleasing,<br/>
					respected<br/>
					and what he ought to become.'</p>
