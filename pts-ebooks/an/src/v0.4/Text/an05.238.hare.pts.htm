					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk in residence<br/>
					follow the course of five things,<br/>
					as his reward he is surely cast into hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Without testing or plumbing the matter,<br/>
					he speaks in praise of the unpraiseworthy;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>
