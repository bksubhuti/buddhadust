					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are five disadvantages to one who has walked in evil in deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The self upbraids the self;<br/>
					from knowledge the wise dispraise him;<br/>
					an evil rumour of his worth goes abroad;<br/>
					he dies muddied in thought;<br/>
					on the breaking up of the body after death<br/>
					he arises in the wayward way,<br/>
					the ill way,<br/>
					the abyss,<br/>
					hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five disadvantages<br/>
					to one who has walked in evil in deed.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are five advantages to one who has walked in good in deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">The self does not upbraid the self;<br/>
					from knowledge the wise praise him;<br/>
					an good rumour of his worth goes abroad;<br/>
					he dies unmuddied in thought;<br/>
					on the breaking up of the body after death<br/>
					he arises in heaven,<br/>
					that happy place of bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five advantages to one who has walked in good in deed.'</p>
