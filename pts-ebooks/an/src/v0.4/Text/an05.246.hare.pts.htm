					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī; and there he addressed the monks, saying: 'Monks.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are five disadvantages to one who has walked in evil in deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The self upbraids the self;<br/>
					from knowledge the wise dispraise him;<br/>
					an evil rumour of his worth goes abroad;<br/>
					he turns from Saddhamma;<br/>
					he is not set in Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five disadvantages<br/>

					<p class="f4">The self does not upbraid the self;<br/>
					from knowledge the wise praise him;<br/>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>
