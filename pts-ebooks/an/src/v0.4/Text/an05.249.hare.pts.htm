					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five disadvantages in a cemetery.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is unclean,<br/>
					evil-smelling,<br/>
					fearful,<br/>
					the haunt of bestial non-humans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					and is the cause of many folk wailing.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five disadvantages in a cemetery.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks, there are these five disadvantages<br/>
					in a cemetery-like person.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, monks, some person<br/>
					who follows the course of unclean action in deed,<br/>
					who follows the course of unclean action in word<br/>
					who follows the course of unclean action in thought —<br/>
					I declare this to be his uncleanness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is unclean,<br/>
					thus-like I declare this person to be.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span> Whoso follows the course of unclean action in deed,<br/>
					whoso follows the course of unclean action in word<br/>
					whoso follows the course of unclean action in thought,<br/>
					an evil rumour of his worth goes about —<br/>
					I declare this to be his evil smell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is evil-smelling,<br/>
					thus-like I declare this person to be.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">At once his course is of unclean action in deed,<br/>
					of unclean action in word<br/>
					of unclean action in thought,<br/>
					his pious<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> fellows in the godly life<br/>
					turn themselves from him<br/>
					and keep far away —<br/>
					I declare this to be his fearfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is fearful,<br/>
					thus-like I declare this person to be.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">As he follows that course of unclean action in deed,<br/>
					that course of unclean action in word<br/>
					that course of unclean action in thought,<br/>
					he lives with others,<br/>
					sharing their ways —<br/>
					I declare this to be his bestial haunting.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is the haunt of bestial non-humans,<br/>
					thus-like I declare this person to be.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing him thus following this course of unclean action in deed,<br/>
					this course of unclean action in word<br/>
					this course of unclean action in thought,<br/>
					<br/>
					his pious fellows in the godly life become vexed<br/>
					and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Alas! this is an ill thing for us,<br/>
					who have to live with such a person!"</p>

					<p class="f4">I declare this to be his making others wail.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is the cause of many folk wailing,<br/>
					thus-like I declare this person to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, there are these five disadvantages in a cemetery-like person.'</p>
