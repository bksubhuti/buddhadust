					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five disadvantages<br/>
					of devotion to one person.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when a person<br/>
					becomes very devoted to a person<br/>
					and that person falls into an error<br/>
					such that the Order suspend him,<br/>
					then he will think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Order has suspended<br/>
					him who is dear and lovely to me!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And he will be no more<br/>
					full of devotion for the monks,<br/>
					and from being without that devotion<br/>
					he will not follow other monks,<br/>
					and from not following other monks<br/>
					he will not hear Saddhamma,<br/>
					and from not hearing Saddhamma<br/>
					he will fall away from Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the first disadvantage<br/>
					of devotion to one person.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or that person falls into an error<br/>
					such that the Order make him sit on the outskirts (of a gathering),<br/>
					then he will think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Order has made<br/>
					him who is dear and lovely to me<br/>
					sit on the outskirts!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And he will be no more<br/>
					full of devotion for the monks,<br/>
					and from being without that devotion<br/>
					he will not follow other monks,<br/>
					and from not following other monks<br/>
					he will not hear Saddhamma,<br/>
					and from not hearing Saddhamma<br/>
					he will fall away from Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the second disadvantage<br/>
					of devotion to one person.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span> Or when a person<br/>
					becomes very devoted to a person<br/>
					and that person is gone to a distant place,<br/>
					then he will think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is gone to a distant place,<br/>
					he who was dear and lovely to me!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And he will not follow other monks,<br/>
					and from not following other monks<br/>
					he will not hear Saddhamma,<br/>
					and from not hearing Saddhamma<br/>
					he will fall away from Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the third disadvantage<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or when a person<br/>
					becomes very devoted to a person<br/>
					and that person wanders<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> (in mind),<br/>
					then he will think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He wanders,<br/>
					he who was dear and lovely to me!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And he will not follow other monks,<br/>
					and from not following other monks<br/>
					he will not hear Saddhamma,<br/>
					and from not hearing Saddhamma<br/>
					he will fall away from Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the fourth disadvantage<br/>
					of devotion to one person.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or when a person<br/>
					becomes very devoted to a person<br/>
					and that person dies,<br/>
					then he will think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is dead,<br/>
					he who was dear and lovely to me!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And he will not follow other monks,<br/>
					and from not following other monks<br/>
					he will not hear Saddhamma,<br/>

					he will fall away from Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the fifth disadvantage<br/>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five disadvantages<br/>
					of devotion to one person.'</p>
