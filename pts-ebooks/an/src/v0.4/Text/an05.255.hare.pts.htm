					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, one lives the godly life by abandoning,<br/>
					cutting off<br/>
					these five forms of stinginess.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">one lives the godly life by abandoning,<br/>
					cutting off<br/>
					stinginess as to one's lodging,<br/>
					one lives the godly life by abandoning,<br/>
					cutting off<br/>
					stinginess as to family,<br/>
					one lives the godly life by abandoning,<br/>
					cutting off<br/>
					stinginess as to gains,<br/>
					one lives the godly life by abandoning,<br/>
					cutting off<br/>
					stinginess as to fame,<br/>
					one lives the godly life by abandoning,<br/>
					cutting off<br/>
					stinginess as to Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, one lives the godly life by abandoning,<br/>
					cutting off<br/>
					these five forms of stinginess."</p>
