					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk who follows six things is worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					the world's peerless field for merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of faith,<br/>
					the power of energy,<br/>
					the power of mindfulness,<br/>
					the power of concentration,<br/>
					the power of insight;<br/>
					destroying the cankers,<br/>
					he enters and abides<br/>
					in the canker-free mind-emancipation,<br/>
					insight-emancipation,<br/>
					realizing this here and now<br/>
					entirely by his own knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, a monk who follows these six things is worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					the world's peerless field for merit.'</p>
