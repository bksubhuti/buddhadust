					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are six ways of being considerate, which endear,<br/>
					bring honour,<br/>
					lead to concord,<br/>
					banish contention,<br/>
					lead to unity,<br/>
					lead to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk's part is amity in deed<br/>
					towards his fellows in the godly life,<br/>
					openly and in private;<br/>
					verily, this is a way of being considerate,<br/>
					which endears,<br/>
					brings honour,<br/>
					leads to concord,<br/>
					banishes contention,<br/>
					leads to unity,<br/>
					leads to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, his part is amity in word,<br/>
					towards his fellows in the godly life,<br/>
					openly and in private;<br/>
					verily, this also is a way of being considerate,<br/>
					which endears,<br/>
					brings honour,<br/>
					leads to concord,<br/>
					banishes contention,<br/>
					leads to unity,<br/>
					leads to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, those proper gains,<br/>
					gotten according to rule -<br/>
					be they but böwl scraps -<br/>
					he loves to share them impartially,<br/>
					to have them in common<br/>
					with his virtuous fellows in the godly life;<br/>
					this also is a way of being considerate,<br/>
					which endears,<br/>
					brings honour,<br/>
					leads to concord,<br/>
					banishes contention,<br/>
					leads to unity,<br/>
					leads to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And those virtues that are unbroken,<br/>
					without flaw,<br/>
					spotless,<br/>
					without blemish,<br/>
					bringing freedom,<br/>
					praised by wise men,<br/>
					incorruptible,<br/>
					leading to concentration -<br/>
					he dwells one in virtue with them<br/>
					among his fellows in the godly life,<br/>
					openly and in private;<br/>
					this also is a way of being considerate,<br/>
					which endears,<br/>
					brings honour,<br/>
					leads to concord,<br/>
					banishes contention,<br/>
					leads to unity,<br/>
					leads to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And that Ariyan view,<br/>
					saving,<br/>
					leading him who acts accordantly<br/>
					to the utter destruction of Ill -<br/>
					he dwells one in view with that<br/>
					among his fellows in the godly life,<br/>
					openly and in private;<br/>
					this also is a way of being considerate,<br/>
					which endears,<br/>
					brings honour,<br/>
					leads to concord,<br/>
					banishes contention,<br/>
					leads to unity,<br/>
					leads to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the six ways of being considerate, which endear,<br/>
					bring honour,<br/>
					lead to concord,<br/>
					banish contention,<br/>
					lead to unity,<br/>
					lead to singleness of heart.'</p>
