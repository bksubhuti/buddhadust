					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sir!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, friend,' they replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The more, reverend sirs, a monk thus fashions his life,<br/>
					the more he fashions it to a remorseful fate.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, reverend sirs,<br/>
					does a monk fashion his life<br/>
					to a remorseful fate?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, reverend sirs,<br/>
					the monk who,<br/>
					finding delight in worldly activity,<br/>
					is delighted with worldly activity,<br/>
					gets engrossed in the delight of worldly activity;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who, finding delight in talk,<br/>
					is delighted with talk,<br/>
					gets engrossed in the delight of talk;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who, finding delight in sleep,<br/>
					is delighted with sleep,<br/>
					gets engrossed in the delight of sleep;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who, finding delight in company,<br/>
					is delighted with company,<br/>
					gets engrossed in the delight of company;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who, finding delight in companionship<br/>
					is delighted with companionship,<br/>
					gets engrossed in the delight of companionship;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who, finding delight in vain fancies -<br/>
					is delighted with vain fancies,<br/>
					gets engrossed in the delight of vain fancies;<br/>
					and thus, reverend sirs,<br/>
					the more he so fashions his life,<br/>
					the more he fashions it to a remorseful fate;<br/>
					and of this monk it is said:</p>

					<p class="f4">With his bundle of life<br/>
					he is greatly delighted;<br/>
					he has not got rid of his bundle<br/>
					for the utter ending of Ill.|| ||</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But the more, reverend sirs,<br/>
					a monk fashions his life in this manner,<br/>
					the more he fashions it to a fate without remorse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, reverend sirs,<br/>
					does a monk fashion his life<br/>
					to a fate without remorse?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the monk who,<br/>
					finding no delight in worldly activity,<br/>
					is not delighted therewith,<br/>
					gets not engrossed in the delight thereof;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who, finding no delight in talk,<br/>
					is not delighted with talk,<br/>
					gets not engrossed in the delight of talk;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who, finding no delight in sleep,<br/>
					is not delighted with sleep,<br/>
					gets not engrossed in the delight of sleep;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who, finding no delight in company,<br/>
					is not delighted with company,<br/>
					gets not engrossed in the delight of company;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who, finding no delight in companionship<br/>
					is not delighted with companionship,<br/>
					gets not engrossed in the delight of companionship;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who, finding no delight in vain fancies -<br/>
					is not delighted with vain fancies,<br/>
					gets not engrossed in the delight of vain fancies;<br/>
					and thus the more he so fashions his life,<br/>
					the more he fashions it to a fate without remorse;<br/>
					and of him it is said:</p>

					<p class="f4">With Nibbāna he is greatly delighted;<br/>
					he has got rid of his bundle of life<br/>
					for the utter ending of Ill.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Fancy-ensnarled, fawn-like too fancy-fond,<br/>
							Ne'er wins he blest Nibbāna's boundless peace:<br/>
							But fancy-rid, intent on freedom's way,<br/>
							He wins to blest Nibbāna's boundless peace.'</p>
