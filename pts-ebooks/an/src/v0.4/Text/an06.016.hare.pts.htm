					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, while the Exalted One was dwelling among the Bhaggis on Crocodile Hill<br/>
					in the Deer Park at Bhesakaḷā <span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span> Grove,<br/>
					the goodman of the house,<br/>
					Nakula's father,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> lay sick sad ailing,<br/>
					grievously ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now his dame, Nakula's mother,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> spoke thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I prithee, goodman, die not fretfully;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					ill is the fate of the fretful;<br/>
					decried by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the fate of the fretful.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe, goodman, you think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Alas, when I am gone,<br/>
					the goodwife, Nakula's mother,<br/>
					will not be able<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> to support the children,<br/>
					nor keep the household together!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But think not so, goodman;<br/>
					for I am deft at spinning cotton,<br/>
					at carding<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> the matted wool;<br/>
					and I can support the children,<br/>
					keep the household,<br/>
					after you have gone.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, goodman,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But think not so, goodman;<br/>
					for you and I know<br/>

					the godly life.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or maybe you think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The goodwife, after I am gone,<br/>
					will have no desire to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					no desire to see the monks of the Order!"</p>

					<p class="f4">But think not so, goodman;<br/>
					for, verily, when you are gone,<br/>
					greater shall be my desire to see the Exalted One<br/>
					greater shall be my desire to see the Order.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>
