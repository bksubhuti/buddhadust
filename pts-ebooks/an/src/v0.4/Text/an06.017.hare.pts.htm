					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On one occasion, while he dwelt near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/>
					the Exalted One,<br/>
					rising from solitude at eventide,<br/>
					approached the service hall;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and, on arriving,<br/>
					sat down on the seat ready there.</p>

					rising from solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to the service hall,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, too, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna,<br/>
					rising from solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to the service hall,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, too, the venerable Mahā Kaccāna,<br/>
					rising from solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to the service hall,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, too, the venerable Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					rising from solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to the service hall,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, too, the venerable Mahā Cunda,<br/>
					rising from solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to the service hall,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, too, the venerable Mahā Kappina,<br/>
					rising from solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to the service hall,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, too, the venerable Anuruddha,<br/>
					rising from solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to the service hall,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, too, the venerable Revata,<br/>
					rising from solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to the service hall,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One,<br/>
					seeing with the deva eye,<br/>
					surpassing the purity of man's,<br/>
					those monks snoring and sleeping till sunrise,<br/>
					went to the service hall and sat down;<br/>
					and being seated,<br/>
					addressed them,<br/>
