					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One<br/>
					with a great company of monks<br/>
					walked a walk among the Kosalese,<br/>
					he saw, as he went along the highway,<br/>
					a fisherman,<br/>
					who had caught a haul of fish<br/>
					and was selling them as a fishmonger;<br/>
					and the Exalted One at the sight<br/>
					stepped off the road<br/>
					and sat down at the foot of a tree<br/>
					on a seat made ready for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, sitting there, he said to the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, see you that fisherman<br/>
					who has caught a haul of fish<br/>
					and is selling them as a fishmonger?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then what think you, monks,<br/>
					have you either seen or heard<br/>
					of a fisherman fishmonger<br/>
					slaughtering and selling fish;<br/>
					and as a result of such deeds,<br/>
					of that way of living,<br/>
					going about on an elephant<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					or on horseback<br/>
					or in a chariot<br/>
					or carriage<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span>or feasting at feasts<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					or living in the abundance of great wealth?</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, indeed, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, monks, neither have I<br/>
					either seen or heard<br/>
					of a fisherman fishmonger<br/>
					slaughtering and selling fish;<br/>

					<p class="f4">And why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, evilly minded<br/>
					he gloats on fish being slaughtered,<br/>
					being brought to the slaughter;<br/>
					and because of that<br/>
					he goes not about on an elephant<br/>
