					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying in the Brick Hall at Nadika,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord,'they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, mindfulness of death,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					made <span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span> to increase,<br/>
					is very fruitful,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, make mindfulness of death become more!'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had spoken thus, a monk said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, lord, make mindfulness of death become.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'How so, monk?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein, lord, such is my thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Were I day and night<br/>

					<p class="f4">And another said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I too, lord, make mindfulness become.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'How so, monk?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is my thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Were I for just so long as I eat an alms-meal<br/>
					to abide mindful of the Exalted One's word,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'How so, monk?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is my thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Were I as I munch and swallow four or five morsels<br/>
					to abide mindful of the Exalted One's word,<br/>

					<p class="f4">thus, lord, I make mindfulness of death become.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is my thought:</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken, the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">those monks are said live indolently;<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span> But the monk who makes mindfulness of death become thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">those monks are said to live earnestly;<br/>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">We will live earnestly;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> keenly will we make mindfulness of death become for the destruction of the cankers.</p>
