					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying in the Brick Hall at Nadika,<br/>
					he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord,'they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, mindfulness of death,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					made to increase,<br/>
					is very fruitful,<br/>
					great in weal,<br/>
					merging in the deathless,<br/>
					having the deathless as consummation.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">How so, monks is mindfulness of death,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					made to increase,<br/>
					very fruitful,<br/>
					great in weal,<br/>
					merging in the deathless,<br/>
					having the deathless as consummation?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the monk who,<br/>
					when day declines and night sets in,<br/>
					reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The chances of death for me are many.</p>

					<p class="f4">Snake,<br/>
					scorpion,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, let that monk reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have I given up every evil and wicked thing which,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if, on reflection,<br/>

					an endeavour,<br/>
					an exertion,<br/>
					a struggle,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as were his cloth and hair on fire<br/>

					an effort,<br/>
					an endeavour,<br/>
					an <span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span> exertion,<br/>

					even so let an urge in great measure be made by him,<br/>

					let him get mindfulness and self-possession,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">But if, monks, on reflection<br/>
					he knows there is no evil or wickedness<br/>
