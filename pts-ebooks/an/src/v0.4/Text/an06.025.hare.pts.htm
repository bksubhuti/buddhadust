					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six states of ever minding.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the Tathāgata:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened,<br/>
					perfected in knowledge and way of life,<br/>
					one well-gone,<br/>
					a knower of the worlds,<br/>
					none higher,<br/>
					a tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					a teacher,<br/>
					the awake among devas and men,<br/>
					the Exalted One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time the Ariyan disciple minds the Tathāgata,<br/>
					his heart is not lust-obsessed,<br/>
					nor hate-obsessed,<br/>
					nor obsessed by infatuation;<br/>
					upright in heart is he at that time,<br/>
					moved,<br/>
					freed,<br/>
					raised from greed;<br/>
					and this greed, monks,<br/>
					is a name for the fivefold sensuous pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, by making this thought their object,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					some men thereby are purged.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma,<br/>
					a view for this life,<br/>
					nor for this only,<br/>
					bidding come and see,<br/>
					a guide,<br/>
					to be known by the wise<br/>
					each for himself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time the Ariyan disciple minds the Dhamma,<br/>

					and this greed, monks,<br/>
					is a name for the fivefold sensuous pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, by making this thought their object,<br/>
					some men thereby are purged.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the Order:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Exalted One's Order of disciples<br/>
					has rightly stepped the way,<br/>
					has straightly stepped the way,<br/>
					has fitly stepped the way,<br/>
					has wholly stepped the way,<br/>
					that is:<br/>
					the four pairs among men,<br/>
					the eight persons among mankind;<br/>
					and this Order of disciples of the Exalted One<br/>
					is worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					the world's peerless field for merit."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the virtues in himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They are unbroken,<br/>
					without a flaw,<br/>
					spotless,<br/>
					without blemish;<br/>
					they bring freedom<br/>
					and are praised by wise men;<br/>
					they are incorruptible<br/>
					and lead to concentration."</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time the Ariyan disciple minds virtues in himself,<br/>
					his heart is not lust-obsessed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, by making this thought their object,<br/>
					some men thereby are purged.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds liberality in himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is indeed a gain for me,<br/>
					indeed I have greatly gained,<br/>
					I who among folk, overwhelmed by the taint of stinginess,<br/>
					live the home-life heart-free of the stingy taint,<br/>
					giving freely,<br/>
					open-hand¢d,<br/>
					loving bounty,<br/>
					within reach of all,<br/>
					finding joy in alms-distribution."</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time the Ariyan disciple minds virtues in himself,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, by making this thought their object,<br/>
					some men thereby are purged.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or the Ariyan disciple ever minds the devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are the Four Royal devas,<br/>
					there are the devas of the Thirty,<br/>
					the Yama devas,<br/>
					the Tusita devas,<br/>
					the devas who delight in creating,<br/>
					the devas who have power over others' creations,<br/>
					the Brahma-world devas,<br/>
					and there are the devas beyond that;<br/>
					because their faith was such,<br/>
					those devas fared hence and arose there,<br/>
					I also have such faith;<br/>
					because their virtue was such,<br/>
					those devas fared hence and arose there,<br/>
					I also have such virtue;<br/>
					because their learning was such,<br/>
					those devas fared hence and arose there,<br/>
					I also have such learning;<br/>
					because their liberality was such,<br/>

					I also have such liberality;<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time the Ariyan disciple minds<br/>
					faith,<br/>
					virtue,<br/>
					learning,<br/>
					liberality<br/>

					both in himself<br/>
					and in those devas<br/>
					his heart is not lust-obsessed,<br/>
