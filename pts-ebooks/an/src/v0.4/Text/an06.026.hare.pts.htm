					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Mahā Kaccāna was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the venerable Mahā Kaccāna addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, reverend sirs!.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sir!' they rejoined;<br/>
					and the venerable one said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is wonderful, reverend sirs;<br/>
					it is amazing<br/>
					how the escape from the noose<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					was conceived by that Exalted One,<br/>
					knower,<br/>
					seer,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully awake -<br/>
					to purge man,<br/>
					overcome grief and woe,<br/>
					clear away pain and distress,<br/>
					win truth,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					realize Nibbāna -<br/>
					I mean the six states of ever minding.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, reverend sirs, the Ariyan disciple who is ever minding the Tathāgata:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened,<br/>
					perfected in knowledge and way of life,<br/>
					one well-gone,<br/>
					a knower of the worlds,<br/>
					none higher,<br/>
					a tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					a teacher,<br/>
					the awake among devas and men,<br/>
					the Exalted One!'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he so minds him,<br/>
					his heart is not lust-obsessed,<br/>
					nor hate-obsessed,<br/>
					nor obsessed by infatuation;<br/>
					upright in heart is he at that time,<br/>
					moved,<br/>
					freed,<br/>
					raised from greed;<br/>
					and this greed, monks,<br/>
					is a name for the fivefold sensuous pleasures;<br/>
					and, sirs, that Ariyan disciple<br/>
					lives at all times<br/>
					with heart spacious,<br/>
					large,<br/>
					lofty,<br/>
					boundless,<br/>
					free of hatred and ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, reverend sirs,<br/>
					by making this thought their object,<br/>
					some men thereby become pure in nature.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma,<br/>
					a view for this life,<br/>
					nor for this only,<br/>
					bidding come and see,<br/>
					a guide,<br/>
					to be known by the wise<br/>
					each for himself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time the Ariyan disciple minds the Dhamma,<br/>
					his heart is not lust-obsessed,<br/>

					nor obsessed by infatuation;<br/>
					upright in heart is he at that time,<br/>
					moved,<br/>
					freed,<br/>
					raised from greed;<br/>
					and this greed, monks,<br/>
					is a name for the fivefold sensuous pleasures;<br/>
					and, sirs, that Ariyan disciple<br/>
					lives at all times<br/>
					with heart spacious,<br/>

					boundless,<br/>
					free of hatred and ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, reverend sirs,<br/>
					by making this thought their object,<br/>
					some men thereby become pure in nature.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the Order:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Exalted One's Order of disciples<br/>
					has rightly stepped the way,<br/>
					has straightly stepped the way,<br/>
					has fitly stepped the way,<br/>
					has wholly stepped the way,<br/>

					the four pairs among men,<br/>
					the eight persons among mankind;<br/>
					and this Order of disciples of the Exalted One<br/>
					is worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					the world's peerless field for merit."</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time the Ariyan disciple minds the Order,<br/>
					his heart is not lust-obsessed,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the virtues in himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They are unbroken,<br/>
					without a flaw,<br/>
					spotless,<br/>
					without blemish;<br/>
					they bring freedom<br/>
					and are praised by wise men;<br/>
					they are incorruptible<br/>
					and lead to concentration."</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time the Ariyan disciple minds virtues in himself,<br/>
					his heart is not lust-obsessed,<br/>
					nor hate-obsessed,<br/>

					by making this thought their object,<br/>
					some men thereby become pure in nature.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds liberality in himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is indeed a gain for me,<br/>
					indeed I have greatly gained,<br/>
					I who among folk, overwhelmed by the taint of stinginess,<br/>
					live the home-life heart-free of the stingy taint,<br/>
					giving freely,<br/>
					open-hand¢d,<br/>
					loving bounty,<br/>
					within reach of all,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Or the Ariyan disciple ever minds the devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are the Four Royal devas,<br/>
					there are the devas of the Thirty,<br/>
					the Yama devas,<br/>
					the Tusita devas,<br/>
					the devas who delight in creating,<br/>
