					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk visited the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and so seated,<br/>
					he said to the Exalted <span class="f2 g"><b>[225]</b></span> One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, how often should one go and see a monk who is a student of mind?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Monk, these six times<br/>
					one should go and see a monk<br/>
					who is a student of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monk, when a monk is obsessed in heart by passionate lust,<br/>
					overwhelmed by passionate lust<br/>
					and knows no refuge,<br/>
					as there really is,<br/>
					from the surge of passionate lust;<br/>
					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind,<br/>
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by passionate lust,<br/>
					overwhelmed thereby,<br/>
					nor know I any refuge from the surge thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br/>
					if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br/>
					to rid me of this lusting."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br/>
					to rid him of that lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the first time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by ill-will<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					overwhelmed by ill-will<br/>
					and knows no refuge,<br/>
					as there really is,<br/>

					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind,<br/>
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by ill-will,<br/>
					overwhelmed by ill-will,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br/>
					if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br/>
					to rid me of this ill-will."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br/>
					to rid him of that ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the second time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by sloth and torpor<br/>
					overwhelmed by sloth and torpor<br/>
					and knows no refuge,<br/>
					as there really is,<br/>
					from the surge of sloth and torpor;<br/>
					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind,<br/>
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by sloth and torpor,<br/>
					overwhelmed by sloth and torpor,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br/>
					to rid him of that sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the third time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by flurry and worry<br/>
					overwhelmed by flurry and worry<br/>
					and knows no refuge,<br/>

					then let him visit a monk,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by flurry and worry,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br/>
					if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br/>
					to rid me of this flurry and worry."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br/>
					to rid him of that flurry and worry.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the fourth time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by or by doubt,<br/>
					overwhelmed by doubt<br/>
					and knows no refuge,<br/>
					as there really is,<br/>
					from the surge of doubt;<br/>
					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind,<br/>
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by doubt,<br/>
					overwhelmed by doubt,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br/>
					to rid him of that doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the fifth time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monk, when from some image,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					as he concentrates thereon,<br/>
					there comes not to him at intervals<br/>
					canker-destruction,<br/>
					nor knows he that image<br/>
					nor realizes it;<br/>
					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind, and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sir, from this image,<br/>
					as I concentrate thereon,<br/>
					there comes not to me at intervals<br/>
					canker-destruction,<br/>
					nor know I that image<br/>
					nor realize it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me, if the venerable <span class="f2 g"><b>[226]</b></span> one would teach me Dhamma<br/>
					to the end that I may destroy the cankers."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhanāna to destroy the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the sixth time<br/>

					who has made a study of mind.'</p>
