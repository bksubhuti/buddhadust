					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when many elders dwelt at the Deer Park in Isipatana, near Benares,<br/>
					there arose by chance this talk among them,<br/>
					as they sat assembled in the round hall,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					after breakfast,<br/>
					on their return from alms-collecting:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What's the proper time, reverend sirs,<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who is a student of mind?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now having stated this,<br/>
					a certain monk said to the elders:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, reverend sirs, a monk,<br/>
					a student of mind,<br/>
					has returned from alms-collecting,<br/>
					breakfasted,<br/>
					washed his feet,<br/>
					seated himself,<br/>
					crossed his legs,<br/>
					straightened his body<br/>
					and made mindfulness stand up,<br/>
					as it were,<br/>
					before him;<br/>
					then is the time to go and see a monk<br/>
					who is a student of mind.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And after he had thus spoken, another said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, reverend sirs,<br/>
					that is not the time to go and see a monk<br/>
					who is a student of mind;<br/>
					for when he has returned from alms-collecting,<br/>
					breakfasted,<br/>
					washed his feet,<br/>
					seated himself,<br/>
					crossed his legs,<br/>
					straightened his body<br/>
					and made mindfulness stand up,<br/>
					as it were,<br/>
					before him;<br/>
					he is languid from his walk<br/>
					and is not then completely at ease;<br/>
					or he is languid after his meal<br/>
					and is not then completely at ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore that is not the time,<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who is a student of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, sirs, in the evening<br/>
					he has risen from seclusion<br/>
					and is seated in the shade of his lodging,<br/>
					cross-legged,<br/>
					with body erect,<br/>
					with mindfulness set before him;<br/>
					then is the time to go and see a monk<br/>
					who is a student of mind.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said another:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, verily, reverend sirs,<br/>
					that is not the time to go and see a monk<br/>
					who is a student of mind; for when, reverend sirs, in the evening<br/>
					he has risen from seclusion<br/>
					and is seated in the shade of his lodging,<br/>
					cross-legged,<br/>
					with body erect,<br/>
					with mindfulness set before him<br/>
					whatsoever concentration-image<br/>
					he has by day concentrated on,<br/>
					just that will then beset him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore that is not the time<br/>
					to go and see that monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, sirs, night recedes<br/>
					and day dawns<br/>
					and he is seated cross-legged<br/>
					with body erect<br/>
					with mindfulness set before him;<br/>
					then is the time to go and see a monk<br/>
					who is a student of mind.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But another monk said:</p>

						

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, neither is that the time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who is a student of mind;<br/>
					for when night recedes<br/>
					and day dawns<br/>
					and he is seated cross-legged<br/>
					with body erect<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[227]</b></span> with mindfulness set before him,<br/>
					then is his body endued with strength<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and he finds comfort in pondering<br/>
					on the teaching of the Buddhas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore that is not the time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who is a student of mind.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken,<br/>
					the venerable Mahā Kaccāna said this to the elders:</p>

					<p class="f4">'From the mouth of the Exalted One, reverend sirs,<br/>
					have I heard this;<br/>
					from his own mouth have I received this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these six times<br/>
					for a monk to go and see<br/>
					a monk who is a student of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monk, when a monk is obsessed in heart by passionate lust,<br/>
					overwhelmed by passionate lust<br/>
					and knows no refuge,<br/>
					as there really is,<br/>
					from the surge of passionate lust;<br/>
					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind,<br/>
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by passionate lust,<br/>
					overwhelmed thereby,<br/>
					nor know I any refuge from the surge thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br/>
					if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br/>
					to rid me of this lusting.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br/>
					to rid him of that lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the first time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by ill-will<br/>
					overwhelmed by ill-will<br/>
					and knows no refuge,<br/>
					as there really is,<br/>
					from the surge of ill-will;<br/>
					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind,<br/>
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by ill-will,<br/>
					overwhelmed by ill-will,<br/>
					nor know I any refuge from the surge of ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br/>
					if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br/>
					to rid me of this ill-will.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br/>
					to rid him of that ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the second time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by sloth and torpor<br/>
					overwhelmed by sloth and torpor<br/>
					and knows no refuge,<br/>
					as there really is,<br/>
					from the surge of sloth and torpor;<br/>
					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind,<br/>
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by sloth and torpor,<br/>
					overwhelmed by sloth and torpor,<br/>
					nor know I any refuge from the surge of sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br/>
					if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br/>
					to rid me of this sloth and torpor.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br/>
					to rid him of that sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the third time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by flurry and worry<br/>
					overwhelmed by flurry and worry<br/>
					and knows no refuge,<br/>
					as there really is,<br/>
					from the surge of flurry and worry;<br/>
					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind,<br/>
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by flurry and worry,<br/>
					overwhelmed by flurry and worry,<br/>
					nor know I any refuge from the surge of flurry and worry.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br/>
					if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br/>
					to rid me of this flurry and worry.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br/>
					to rid him of that flurry and worry.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the fourth time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by or by doubt,<br/>
					overwhelmed by doubt<br/>
					and knows no refuge,<br/>
					as there really is,<br/>
					from the surge of doubt;<br/>
					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind,<br/>
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by doubt,<br/>
					overwhelmed by doubt,<br/>
					nor know I any refuge from the surge of doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br/>
					if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br/>
					to rid me of this doubt.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br/>
					to rid him of that doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the fifth time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monk, when from some image,<br/>
					as he concentrates thereon,<br/>
					there comes not to him at intervals<br/>
					canker-destruction,<br/>
					nor knows he that image<br/>
					nor realizes it;<br/>
					then let him visit a monk,<br/>
					who has made a study of mind, and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, from this image,<br/>
					as I concentrate thereon,<br/>
					there comes not to me at intervals<br/>
					canker-destruction,<br/>
					nor know I that image<br/>
					nor realize it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me, if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br/>
					to the end that I may destroy the cankers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhanāna to destroy the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the sixth time<br/>
					to go and see a monk<br/>
					who has made a study of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">From the mouth of the Exalted One<br/>
					have I heard this;<br/>
					from his very mouth have I received this.'</p>
