					<p class="f4">'Lord, there are five states.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, lord, a monk, aloof from sensuous appetites,<br/>

					and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This state of ever minding, lord,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>
					<p class="f4">Free from the zest for joy,<br/>

					and experiences in his being<br/>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, he concentrates<br/>
					on the thought of light,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					fixes his mind on the thought of day -<br/>

					upwards from the soles of his feet,<br/>
					downwards from the hair of his head,<br/>
					as skin-bound,<br/>
