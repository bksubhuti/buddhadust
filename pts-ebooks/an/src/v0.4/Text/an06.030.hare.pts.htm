					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these six are above all.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">The sight above all;<br/>
					the sound above all;<br/>
					the gain above all;<br/>
					the training above all;<br/>
					the service above all;<br/>
					the ever minding above all.</p>

					wrong in view,<br/>
					treading the wrong path.</p>

					<p class="f4">And is that the sight, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">I say it is not;<br/>
