					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once when the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br/>
					this thought came to the venerable Mahā Moggallāna,<br/>
					gone apart for solitude:</p>

					<p class="f4">'To how many devas is there this knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We have Won to the Stream;<br/>
					are no more for the abyss;<br/>
					in sureness we make for the awakening beyond?"'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> at that time<br/>
					a monk named Tissa had just died<br/>
					and was reborn in one of the Brahma worlds,<br/>
					and they knew him even there as Tissa the mighty,<br/>
					Tissa the powerful.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna —<br/>
					as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br/>
					might bend his stretched arm —<br/>
					vanished from Jeta Grove<br/>
					and appeared in that Brahma-world.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And deva Tissa saw the venerable one from afar,<br/>
					coming along,<br/>
					and on <span class="f2 g"><b>[234]</b></span> seeing him said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, worthy<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> Moggallāna;<br/>
					welcome, worthy Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">'Tis long since you made this round,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">Pray be seated, good sir, here is the seat ready.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā Moggallāna sat down;<br/>
					and deva Tissa,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					sat down also,<br/>
					at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the venerable Mahā Moggallāna<br/>
					to deva Tissa,<br/>
					so seated:</p>

					<p class="f4">'To how many devās, Tissa,<br/>
					is there this knowledge:</p>
