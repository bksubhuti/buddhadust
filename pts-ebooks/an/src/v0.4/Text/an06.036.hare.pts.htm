					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'Monks, these six are the roots of contention.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Monks, suppose a monk be angry, scornful.</p>

					<p class="f4">An he be so, he lives without reverence,<br/>
					respect for the Master,<br/>
					Dhamma<br/>
					or the Order;<br/>
					he fulfils not the training.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he who lives thus,<br/>
					causes contention in the Order,<br/>
					and that is to the hurt and sorrow of many folk,<br/>
					to the harm of many folk,<br/>
					to the hurt and ill of devas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if you see this root of contention among you<br/>
					or among others,<br/>
					strive to rid yourselves of this evil thing;<br/>
					and if you see it not,<br/>
					step the way to stop its future cankering.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is this evil root of contention rid;<br/>
					and thus shall there be no future cankering.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Again, monks, suppose a monk be a hypocrite,<br/>
					malicious.</p>

					<p class="f4">An he be a hypocrite, malicious,<br/>
					he lives without reverence,<br/>
					respect for the Master,<br/>
					Dhamma<br/>
					or the Order;<br/>
					he fulfils not the training.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he who lives thus,<br/>
					causes contention in the Order,<br/>
					and that is to the hurt and sorrow of many folk,<br/>
					to the harm of many folk,<br/>
					to the hurt and ill of devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if you see this root of contention among you<br/>
					or among others,<br/>
					strive to rid yourselves of this evil thing;<br/>
					and if you see it not,<br/>
					step the way to stop its future cankering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is this evil root of contention rid;<br/>
					and thus shall there be no future cankering.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Again, monks, suppose a monk be envious,<br/>
					mean.</p>

					<p class="f4">An he be envious, mean,<br/>
					he lives without reverence,<br/>
					respect for the Master,<br/>
					Dhamma<br/>
					or the Order;<br/>
					he fulfils not the training.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he who lives thus,<br/>
					causes contention in the Order,<br/>
					and that is to the hurt and sorrow of many folk,<br/>
					to the harm of many folk,<br/>
					to the hurt and ill of devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if you see this root of contention among you<br/>
					or among others,<br/>
					strive to rid yourselves of this evil thing;<br/>
					and if you see it not,<br/>
					step the way to stop its future cankering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is this evil root of contention rid;<br/>
					and thus shall there be no future cankering.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>
					<p class="f4">6. Again, monks, suppose a monk be deceitful,<br/>
					crafty.</p>

					<p class="f4">An he be deceitful, crafty,<br/>
					he lives without reverence,<br/>
					respect for the Master,<br/>
					Dhamma<br/>
					or the Order;<br/>
					he fulfils not the training.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he who lives thus,<br/>
					causes contention in the Order,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if you see this root of contention among you<br/>
					or among others,<br/>
					strive to rid yourselves of this evil thing;<br/>
					and if you see it not,<br/>
					step the way to stop its future cankering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is this evil root of contention rid;<br/>
					and thus shall there be no future cankering.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Again, monks, suppose a monk be evil-minded,<br/>
					wrong in view.</p>

					<p class="f4">An he be evil-minded,	wrong in view,<br/>
					he lives without reverence,<br/>
					respect for the Master,<br/>
					Dhamma<br/>
					or the Order;<br/>
					he fulfils not the training.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he who lives thus,<br/>
					causes contention in the Order,<br/>
					and that is to the hurt and sorrow of many folk,<br/>
					to the harm of many folk,<br/>
					to the hurt and ill of devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if you see this root of contention among you<br/>
					or among others,<br/>
					strive to rid yourselves of this evil thing;<br/>
					and if you see it not,<br/>
					step the way to stop its future cankering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is this evil root of contention rid;<br/>
					and thus shall there be no future cankering.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Again, monks, suppose a monk be view-bound,<br/>
					tenacious, stubborn.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">An he be view-bound, tenacious, stubborn,<br/>
					he lives without reverence,<br/>
					respect for the Master,<br/>
					Dhamma<br/>
					or the Order;<br/>
					he fulfils not the training.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he who lives thus,<br/>
					causes contention in the Order,<br/>
					and that is to the hurt and sorrow of many folk,<br/>
					to the harm of many folk,<br/>
					to the hurt and ill of devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if you see this root of contention among you<br/>
					or among others,<br/>
					strive to rid yourselves of this evil thing;<br/>
					and if <span class="f2 g"><b>[236]</b></span> you see it not,<br/>
					step the way to stop its future cankering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is this evil root of contention rid;<br/>
					and thus shall there be no future cankering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these six are the roots of contention.'</p>
