					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[241]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I said:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Once<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Exalted One walked a walk<br/>
					with a great company of monks<br/>
					among the Kosalese<br/>
					and came to a Kosalan brahman village called Icchānangala.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there in the Icchānaṇgala grove the Exalted One dwelt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahman householders of that place heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse, Master Gotama,<br/>
					the Sakya,<br/>
					gone forth from the Sakya clan,<br/>
					has arrived at Icchānaṇgala<br/>
					and stays in the grove hard by;<br/>
					and of that same Master Gotama<br/>
					this fair report is noised abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					perfectly enlightened,<br/>
					endowed with wisdom and righteousness,<br/>
					one well-gone,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					the unsurpassed,<br/>
					a tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					a teacher,<br/>
					a Buddha of devas and men,<br/>
					the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Having realized more-knowledge himself,<br/>
					he declares it to this world<br/>
					with its devas<br/>
					and Māras<br/>
					and Brahmas,<br/>
					to this earth with its recluses and brahmans,<br/>
					its devas and men;<br/>
					and he teaches Dhamma,<br/>
					lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle<br/>
					and lovely in the end;<br/>
					and sets forth the godly life,<br/>
					utterly pure and perfect,<br/>
					both in spirit and letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed is it to see such arahants!"'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at dawn<br/>
					those brahman householders went to the grove,<br/>
					taking with them much hard and soft food;<br/>
					and they stood at the gateway making a great tumult.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Nāgita served the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to the venerable Nāgita:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is this great tumult, Nāgita?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Tis as though fisher-folk had caught a great haul!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'These, lord, are the Icchānaṇgala brahman householders,<br/>
					who have brought much hard and soft food<br/>
					for the Exalted One<br/>
					and the monks;<br/>
					and they now stand without.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have naught to do with homage, Nāgita,<br/>
					nor need I homage.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					freely,<br/>
					readily,<br/>
					the ease of renunciation,<br/>
					the ease of seclusion,<br/>
					the ease of calm,<br/>
					the ease of enlightenment,<br/>
					as I can,<br/>
					let him wallow<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[242]</b></span> in that dung-like<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> ease,<br/>
					that clog<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> of ease,<br/>
					that ease gotten of gains,<br/>
					favours<br/>
					and flattery.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, let the Exalted One accept their offering now;<br/>
					let the Well-gone accept!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, now is the time to accept;<br/>
					for whither soever the Exalted One shall henceforth go,<br/>
					the brahman householders of town and countryside<br/>
					shall be so inclined.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, just as when the rain-deva rains abundantly,<br/>
					the waters flow with the incline;<br/>
					even so, lord,<br/>
					whither soever the Exalted One shall henceforth go,<br/>
					the brahman householders of town and countryside<br/>
					shall be so inclined.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">So great, lord, is the Exalted One's virtue and wisdom.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have naught to do with homage, Nāgita,<br/>
					nor need I homage;<br/>
					but whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					freely,<br/>
					readily,<br/>
					the ease of renunciation,<br/>
					seclusion,<br/>
					calm,<br/>
					enlightenment,<br/>
					as I can,<br/>
					let him wallow in that dung-like ease,<br/>
					that clog of ease,<br/>
					that ease gotten of gains,<br/>
					favours<br/>
					and flattery.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Nagita, I see a monk seated,<br/>
					rapt,<br/>
					on the outskirts of some village;<br/>
					then I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Presently a park-man<br/>
					or a novice<br/>
					will disturb the reverend sir<br/>
					and will oust him from that concentration."</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Nāgita, I am not pleased<br/>
					with that monk's abode.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Or I see one forest-gone,<br/>
					seated nodding in the forest;<br/>
					then I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Presently he will dispel sleep and fatigue,<br/>
					attend to the forest-sense<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> and solitude."</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Nāgita, I am pleased<br/>
					with his forest-abiding.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Or I see one forest-gone,<br/>
					seated,<br/>
					rapt;<br/>
					then I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Presently he will compose<br/>
					the uncomposed mind<br/>
					or will continue to ward<br/>
					the freed mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Nāgita, I am pleased<br/>
					with his forest-abiding.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Or I see one living on a village outskirts,<br/>
					getting the requisites:<br/>
					robe,<br/>
					alms,<br/>
					bed<br/>
					and medicaments;<br/>
					and, delighting in those gains,<br/>
					favours<br/>
					and flattery,<br/>
					he neglects to go apart,<br/>
					neglects the forest,<br/>
					the woodland ways,<br/>
					the lonely lodgings;<br/>
					he gets his living<br/>
					by visiting village,<br/>
					town<br/>
					and capital.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Nāgita, I am not pleased<br/>
					with his abiding.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Or I see a monk,<br/>
					forest-gone,<br/>
					getting the requisites,<br/>
					but staving off gains,<br/>
					favours<br/>
					and flattery,<br/>
					neglecting not to go <span class="f2 g"><b>[243]</b></span> apart,<br/>
					neglecting not the woodland ways,<br/>
					the lonely lodgings.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Nāgita,<br/>
					I am pleased with that monk's forest-abiding.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">But when walking along the highway, Nāgita,<br/>
					I see nothing whatever in front nor behind,<br/>
					it suits<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> me,<br/>
