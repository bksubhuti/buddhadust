					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">One morning the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					robing early,<br/>
					took bowl and cloak<br/>
					and went to the house of the lay disciple, Migasālā,<br/>
					and there sat down on seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Migasālā came<br/>
					and saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, she said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, reverend sir,<br/>
					how ought one to understand this Dhamma<br/>
					taught by the Exalted One:<br/>
					that both he who lives the godly life<br/>
					and he who does not<br/>
					shall become like-wayfarers<br/>
					in the world to come?</p>

					<p class="f4">My father, sir, Purāṇa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					lived the godly life,<br/>
					dwelling apart,<br/>
					abstaining from common,<br/>
					carnal things;<br/>
					and when he died,<br/>
					the Exalted One explained:</p>

					<p class="f4">He's a Once-returner,<br/>
					dwelling in Tusita.</p>

					<p class="f4">My uncle,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> sir, Isidatta,<br/>
					did not live the godly life<br/>
					but rejoiced with a wife;<br/>
					and of him also,<br/>
					when dead,<br/>
					the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">He's a Once-returner,<br/>
					dwelling in Tusita.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend Ānanda, how ought one to understand this Dhamma<br/>

					in the world to come?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even, sister, as the Exalted One has said.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">'And when the venerable Ānanda had received alms in Migasālā's house,<br/>
					he rose from his seat and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on his return from alms-gathering,<br/>
					after his meal,<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda visited the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[247]</b></span> and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and so seated,<br/>
					he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">This morning, lord, robing early,<br/>
					I took bowl and cloak<br/>
					and went to the house of the lay disciple, Migasālā,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So seated, she said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, reverend sir,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'I told her, lord,<br/>

					<p class="f4">These six persons, Ānanda, are found in the world.</p>
