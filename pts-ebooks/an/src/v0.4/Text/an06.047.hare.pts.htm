					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Sīvaka of the Top-knot,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					a wanderer,<br/>
					visited the Exalted One,<br/>
					greeted him<br/>
					and, after exchanging the usual compliments,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'They say, sir,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Dhamma's for this life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					Dhamma's for this life!"</p>

					<p class="f4">But how, sir, is Dhamma for this life,<br/>
					for other worlds,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
