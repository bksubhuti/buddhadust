					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">A brāhman,<br/>
					approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					greeted him<br/>
					and, after exchanging the usual compliments,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'They say, sir,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dhamma's for this life,<br/>
					Dhamma's for this life!"</p>

					<p class="f4">But how, sir, is Dhamma for this life,<br/>
					for other worlds,<br/>
					bidding "Come see,"<br/>
					leading onwards,<br/>
					knowable to the wise by its relation to self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, brāhman,<br/>
					I will just question you in turn about this;<br/>
					answer as you please.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, brāhman,<br/>
					suppose there's passion here in the self,<br/>
					would you know:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There's passion here in myself" -</p>

					<p class="f4">or suppose there's no passion,<br/>
					would you know: </p>

					<p class="f4">"There is no passion here in myself"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, when you know<br/>
					"There's passion here in myself"<br/>
					when you know<br/>
					"There is no passion here in myself"<br/>
					thus is Dhamma for this life,<br/>
					for other worlds,<br/>

					by its relation to self.</p>
