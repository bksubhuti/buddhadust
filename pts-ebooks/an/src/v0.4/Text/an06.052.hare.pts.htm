					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now brahman Jānussoṇi<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					greeted him<br/>
					and, after exchanging the usual polite talk,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master Gotama,<br/>
					what's a noble's aim,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					what's his quest,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'This, indeed, is wonderful, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">This, indeed, is wonderful, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">'Tis just as if one had set upright a thing toppled over,<br/>
					opened out a covered thing,<br/>
					showed a blind man along the road,<br/>
					brought an oil lamp into the dark,<br/>
					so that those that had eyes could see objects —<br/>
					it is just thus that Dhamma<br/>
					has been blazed abroad by Master Gotama<br/>
					in manifold ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, Master Gotama,<br/>
					go to Master Gotama for help,<br/>
					to Dhamma<br/>
					and to the monk-Order;<br/>
					let Master Gotama look upon me as a lay-disciple,<br/>

					henceforth as long as life lasts!'</p>
