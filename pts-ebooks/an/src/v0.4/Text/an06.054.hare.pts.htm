					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[260]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, while the Exalted One was dwelling on Mount Vulture Peak near Rājagaha,<br/>
					the venerable Dhammika was<br/>
					a lodger in his native district.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And there were there altogether seven settlements.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Dhammika went about insulting the monks who visited,<br/>
					reviling them,<br/>
					annoying them,<br/>
					nudging them,<br/>
					vexing them with talk;<br/>
					and they,<br/>
					insulted,<br/>
					reviled,<br/>
					annoyed,<br/>
					nudged,<br/>
					vexed with talk;<br/>
					departed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And the local<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> lay-disciples thought to themselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We're <span class="f2 g"><b>[261]</b></span> ready enough<br/>

					yet visiting monks depart,<br/>
					nor settle here,<br/>
					but quit the lodging.</p>

					<p class="f4">What's the cause and reason for this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And they thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's the venerable Dhammika!</p>

					<p class="f4">He insults the monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we send him forth."</p>

					<p class="f4">So they went to the venerable Dhammika<br/>
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, let the venerable Dhammika depart,<br/>
					long enough has he lodged here!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Dhammika left that lodging<br/>

					<p class="f4">And the local lay-disciples thought to themselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Dhammika left that lodging<br/>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we send him forth."</p>

					<p class="f4">So they went to the venerable Dhammika<br/>
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, let the venerable Dhammika<br/>
					leave all seven local lodgings!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought the venerable Dhammika:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am sent forth by the local lay-disciples<br/>
					from all seven lodgings of my birthplace;<br/>
					where shall I go now?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What if I visit the Exalted One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Dhammika,<br/>
					with robe and bowl,<br/>
					departed for Rājagaha,<br/>
					and in due time<br/>
					came to Mount Vulture Peak<br/>
					near Rājagaha;<br/>
					and approaching the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said to him,<br/>
					so seated:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					whence come you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I have been sent forth by the local lay-folk<br/>
					from the seven lodgings of my native district."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come now, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					what's that to you?</p>

					<p class="f4">No matter where they have sent you forth<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> from,<br/>
					you have gone forth<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					thence to come to me!</p>

					<p class="f4">In<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> times past, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					when seafaring <span class="f2 g"><b>[262]</b></span> merchants put to sea in ships,<br/>
					they took with them<br/>
					a bird to sight land.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the ship was out of sight of land,<br/>
					they freed the bird;<br/>
					and it flew eastward<br/>
					and westward,<br/>
					northward<br/>
					and southward,<br/>
					upward<br/>
					and around.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if the bird sighted land near by,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					it was gone for good;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					but if the bird saw no land,<br/>
					it returned to the ship.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					no matter where they have sent you forth from,<br/>
					you have gone forth<br/>
					thence to come to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Long ago, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					rajah Koravya<span class="f3"><sup>8</sup></span> had a king-banyan tree called Steadfast,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>
					and the shade of its widespread<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> branches<br/>
					was cool and lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Its shelter broadened to twelve leagues,<br/>
					its roots spread to five<br/>
					and the great fruit thereof was in keeping -<br/>
					as big as pipkins<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					was the sweet fruit,<br/>
					clear and as sweet as the honey of bees.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the rajah and his concubines<br/>
					enjoyed one portion of Steadfast,<br/>
					the army another;<br/>
					the town and Country folk<br/>
					enjoyed one portion,<br/>
					recluses and godly men<br/>
					one portion,<br/>
					and one portion<br/>
					the beasts and birds enjoyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">None guarded its fruit<br/>
					and none hurt another<br/>
					for its fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now there came a man<br/>
					who ate his fill of fruit,<br/>
					broke a branch<br/>
					and Went his way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought the deva dwelling in Steadfast:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How amazing,<br/>
					how astonishing it is,<br/>
					that a man should be so evil<br/>
					as to break a branch off Steadfast,<br/>
					after eating his fill!</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose Steadfast<br/>
					were to bear no more fruit!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And Steadfast bore no more fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					rajah Koravya visited Sakka,<br/>
					king of devas,<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, your grace,<br/>
					know you that Steadfast,<br/>
					the king-banyan tree,<br/>
					bears no fruit?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[263]</b></span> And Sakka, the deva-king,<br/>
					worked a work of mystic power<br/>
					so that there came<br/>
					a mighty wind and rain<br/>
					which smote Steadfast<br/>
					and overturned him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the deva dwelling there<br/>
					was full of grief and despair<br/>
					and stood beside Steadfast,<br/>
					weeping and lamenting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					the deva-king, Sakka,<br/>
					approached the deva of the banyan tree<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What ails thee, deva?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your grace, a mighty squall has come<br/>
					and overturned my home.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Came that squall, deva,<br/>
					whilst thou<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> keptest tree-Dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But how, your grace,<br/>
					keeps a tree<br/>
					tree-Dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just thus, deva:</p>

					<p class="f4">The grubber takes the roots,<br/>
					the stripper the bark,<br/>
					the plucker the leaves,<br/>
					the picker the fruit,<br/>
					nor therefore is there any cause<br/>
					for the deva to mope and pine -<br/>
					thus keeps a tree tree-Dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your grace, I was not keeping tree-Dhamma,<br/>
					when the squall came<br/>
					and smote and overturned my home.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yet, deva,<br/>
					should thou keep tree-Dhamma,<br/>
					thy home would be as of yore.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then I will keep tree-Dhamma, your grace;<br/>
					let my home be as of yore!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					the deva-king, Sakka,<br/>
					worked a work of mystic power<br/>
					and there came a mighty wind and rain<br/>
					which set up Steadfast,<br/>
					the king-banyan tree,<br/>
					and healed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> his roots.</p>

					<p class="f4">Did you, even so, brāhman Dhammika,<br/>
					keep recluse-Dhamma,<br/>
					when the local lay-folk sent you forth<br/>
					from each of the seven lodgings<br/>
					of your birthplace?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, lord, keeps a recluse<br/>
					recluse-Dhamma?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thuswise, brāhman Dhammika:</p>

					<p class="f4">A recluse returns not <span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span> the insult of the insulter,<br/>
					the anger of the angry,<br/>
					the abuse of the abuser<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					thus keeps a recluse<br/>
					recluse-Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Too true, lord,<br/>
					I kept not recluse-Dhamma<br/>
					when the local lay-folk<br/>
					sent me forth from the seven lodgings."</p>
