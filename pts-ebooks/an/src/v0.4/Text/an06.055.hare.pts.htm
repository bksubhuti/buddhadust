					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[266]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was dwelling near Rājagaha,,<br/>
					on Mount Vulture Peak,<br/>
					the venerable Sona<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> dwelt on Cool Wood<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					near Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sona,<br/>
					in solitude apart,<br/>
					communed thus in his heart:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'The Exalted one's disciples live in active energy<br/>
					and I am one of them;<br/>
					yet my heart is not detached<br/>
					and free of the cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">My family is rich<br/>
					and I can enjoy riches and do good;<br/>
					what if I were to forsake the training<br/>
					and turn to low things,<br/>
					enjoy riches and do good!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One,<br/>
					knowing in his own heart<br/>
					the venerable Sona's thoughts<br/>
					— as a strong man might stretch his bent arm<br/>
					or bend his stretched arm —<br/>
					left Mount Vulture Peak<br/>
					and appeared in Cool Wood<br/>
					before the venerable Sona.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when <span class="f2 g"><b>[267]</b></span> his seat was ready,<br/>
					the Exalted One sat down;<br/>
					and the venerable Sona,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					also sat down — at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said to him, so seated:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sona, did you not thus commune in your heart:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"The Exalted one's disciples live in active energy<br/>
					and I am one of them;<br/>
					yet my heart is not detached<br/>
					and free of the cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">My family is rich<br/>
					and I can enjoy riches and do good;<br/>
					what if I were to forsake the training<br/>
					and turn to low things,<br/>
					enjoy riches and do good!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bethink you, Sona,<br/>
					were you not, in the old days at home,<br/>
					clever at the lute's stringed music?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'And bethink you, Sona,<br/>
					when your lute's strings were over-strung,<br/>
					was your lute then tuneful and playable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, indeed, lord.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'And bethink you, Sona,<br/>
					when your lute's strings were over-lax,<br/>
					was your lute then tuneful and playable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, indeed, lord.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'But when, Sona,<br/>
					your lute's strings were neither over-strung<br/>
					nor over-lax,<br/>
					but keyed to the middle pitch,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					was your lute then tuneful and playable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, lord'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Sona,<br/>
					energy, when over-strung,<br/>
					ends in flurry,<br/>
					when over-lax,<br/>
					in idleness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Sona,<br/>
					stand fast in the mean<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> of energy;<br/>
					pierce the mean (in the use) of the faculties;<br/>
					and therein grasp the real worth.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span> 'Yes, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One,<br/>
					after charging the venerable Sona with this counsel<br/>
					— as a strong man might bend his arm to and fro —<br/>
					left Cool Wood<br/>
					and appeared on Mount Vulture Peak.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And presently<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> the venerable Sona stood fast in the mean of energy;<br/>
					pierced the mean in the faculties;<br/>
					and grasped therein the mark;<br/>
					and living alone, secluded,<br/>
					earnest, ardent, resolute,<br/>
					entered and abode, not long after,<br/>
					here amid things seen,<br/>
					by his own power,<br/>
					in the realization of that end above all<br/>
					of the godly life,<br/>
					for the sake of which<br/>
					clansmen rightly go forth<br/>
					from the home to the homeless life;<br/>
					and he knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Birth is ended,<br/>
					the godly life lived,<br/>
					done is what was to be done,<br/>
					there is no more of this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Sona<br/>
					was numbered among the arahants.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, having won to arahantship,<br/>
					the venerable Sona thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose I visit the Exalted One<br/>
					and declare gnosis<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> near him!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he went to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him, and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and so seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, the arahant monk<br/>
					who has destroyed the cankers,<br/>
					lived the life,<br/>
					done what was to be done,<br/>
					set down the burden,<br/>
					won self-weal,<br/>
					shattered life's fetter<br/>
					and is freed by perfect gnosis<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps, lord, some venerable person may think:</p>
