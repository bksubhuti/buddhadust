					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[270]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> at that time<br/>
					the venerable Phagguna was sick,<br/>
					ailing,<br/>
					very ill;<br/>
					and the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					went to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, the venerable Phagguna is sick,<br/>
					ailing,<br/>
					very ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good were it, lord,<br/>
					if the Exalted One<br/>
					were to go and see the venerable Phagguna<br/>
					out of compassion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One consented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then in the evening,<br/>
					after he had come from solitude,<br/>
					the Exalted One visited the venerable Phagguna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Phagguna saw him coming,<br/>
					when he was some way off,<br/>
					and stirred<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> on his bed;<br/>
					but the Exalted One spoke to him and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, Phagguna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stir not on your bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there not these seats<br/>
					here prepared already?</p>

					<p class="f4">I will sit here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sat down<br/>
					on the seat prepared.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I hope, Phagguna, you're bearing up,<br/>
					keeping going;<br/>
					that your aches and pains grow less,<br/>
					not more;<br/>
					that there are signs of their growing less,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					not more?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, I can neither bear up<br/>
					nor keep going;<br/>
					my aches and pains grow grievously more,<br/>
					not less;<br/>
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br/>
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> the violent ache<br/>
					that racks my head<br/>
					is just as though some lusty fellow<br/>
					chopped at it with a sharp-edged sword;<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[271]</b></span> lord, I can neither bear up<br/>
					nor keep going;<br/>
					my pains grow more,<br/>
					not less;<br/>
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br/>
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, the violent pain in my head<br/>
					is just as though some lusty fellow<br/>
					clapped a stout leather strap about it;<br/>
					lord, I cannot bear up<br/>
					nor keep going;<br/>
					my pains grow more,<br/>
					not less;<br/>
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br/>
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, the violent stab<br/>
					that shoots through my stomach<br/>
					is just as though a skilful butcher<br/>
					or his apprentice<br/>
					gutted it with a carving knife;<br/>
					lord, I cannot bear up<br/>
					nor keep going;<br/>
					my pains grow more,<br/>
					not less;<br/>
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br/>
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, the fever of my body<br/>
					is just as though a couple of lusty fellows<br/>
					had seized a weakling by his limbs<br/>
					and toasted him<br/>
					and roasted him<br/>
					over a fire-pit;<br/>
					lord, I cannot bear bear up<br/>
					nor keep going;<br/>
					my pains grow more,<br/>
					not less;<br/>
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br/>
					not less.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One instructed him,<br/>
					roused him,<br/>
					gladdened him<br/>
					and comforted him<br/>
					with Dhamma-talk,<br/>
					then rose from his seat<br/>
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the Exalted One's departure,<br/>
					the venerable Phagguna died;<br/>
					and at the time of his death<br/>
					his faculties were completely purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then went the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, not long after the Exalted One left,<br/>
					the venerable Phagguna died;<br/>
					and at that time<br/>
					his faculties were completely purified.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But why, Ānanda,<br/>
					should not the faculties of the monk, Phagguna,<br/>
					have been completely purified?</p>

					<p class="f4">The monk's mind, Ānanda,<br/>
					had<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> not been wholly freed<br/>
					from the five lower fetters;<br/>
					but, when he heard that Dhamma teaching,<br/>
					his mind was wholly freed.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six advantages, Ānanda,<br/>
					in hearing Dhamma in time,<br/>
					in testing its goodness in time.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, Ānanda, the monk<br/>
					whose mind is not wholly freed<br/>
					from the five lower fetters,<br/>
					but, when dying,<br/>
					is able to see the Tathāgata:<br/>
					the Tathāgata teaches him Dhamma,<br/>
					lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely in the end,<br/>
					its goodness,<br/>
					its significance;<br/>
					and makes known the godly life,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[272]</b></span> wholly fulfilled,<br/>
					perfectly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has heard that Dhamma teaching,<br/>
					his mind is wholly freed<br/>
					from the five lower fetters.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda,<br/>
					is the first advantage<br/>
					in hearing Dhamma in time,<br/>
					in testing its goodness in time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, Ānanda, the monk<br/>
