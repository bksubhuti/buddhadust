					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying in the Brick Hall at Nādika,<br/>
					a householder,<br/>
					a wood-seller,<br/>
					visited him,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Exalted One said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Maybe, householder, alms are given by your family?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[279]</b></span> '0 yes, lord, and in this way too:<br/>
					such monks as are forest-gone,<br/>
					almsmen,<br/>
					rag-wearers -<br/>
					arahants<br/>
					or men won to the arahant's Way -<br/>
					to them, lord, alms are given by my family.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'But surely, householder,<br/>
					it's a hard thing for you -<br/>
					a layman,<br/>
					engrossed in pleasures,<br/>
					encumbered with children,<br/>
					odorous with Kāsi's sandalwood,<br/>
					decked with flowers and scented oils,<br/>
					merry with silver and gold<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					to tell which are arahants<br/>
					and which have won<br/>
					to the arahants' Way!</p>

					be puffed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> up,<br/>
