					a number of elders,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[280]</b></span> who had returned from alms-gathering, and fed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now from time to time the venerable Citta Hatthisariputta<br/>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let not the venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta<br/>
					constantly interrupt the elders' Abhidhamma talk;<br/>
					the venerable Citta should wait<br/>

					<p class="f4">A wise man is the venerable Citta<br/>
