					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[284]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One dwelt near Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<br/>
					a number of elders,<br/>
					who had returned from alms-gathering, and fed,<br/>
					sat together in the round hall;<br/>
					and this talk by change arose:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, sirs, was said by the Exalted One<br/>
					in "The Way to the Beyond,"<br/>
					in the questions of Metteyya.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 in1">"Who knows both ends — not midst<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> that sage is soiled:<br/>
					Him call I 'great man'; he here hath passed the seamstress."</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, pray, is the first end,<br/>
					what's the second,<br/>
					what's in the middle<br/>
					and who's the seamstress?'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now after this had been said,<br/>
					one of the monks answered the elders and said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Contact, sirs, is the first end,<br/>
					its arising is the second,<br/>
					its ceasing is in the middle,<br/>
					and craving is the seamstress;<br/>
					for craving sews one<br/>
					just to this ever-becoming birth.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>
					a monk knows the know- <span class="f2 g"><b>[285]</b></span> able,<br/>
					comprehends the comprehensible;<br/>
					and knowing the knowable,<br/>
					comprehending the comprehensible,<br/>
					he makes an end of Ill,<br/>
					here now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken, another said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'The past is the first end,<br/>
					the future the second,<br/>
					the present is in the middle,<br/>
					and craving is the seamstress;<br/>
					for craving sews one<br/>
					just to this ever-becoming birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>
					a monk knows the knowable,<br/>
					comprehends the comprehensible;<br/>
					and knowing the knowable,<br/>
					comprehending the comprehensible,<br/>
					he makes an end of Ill,<br/>
					here now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And another said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Pleasure<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> is the first end,<br/>
					pain is the second,<br/>
					indifference is in the middle,<br/>
					and craving is the seamstress;<br/>
					for craving sews one<br/>
					just to this ever-becoming birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>
					a monk knows the knowable,<br/>

					and knowing the knowable,<br/>
					comprehending the comprehensible,<br/>
					he makes an end of Ill,<br/>
					here now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And another said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Name is the first end,<br/>
					form is the second,<br/>
					consciousness is in the middle,<br/>
					and craving is the seamstress;<br/>
					for craving sews one<br/>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>

					here now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And another said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'One's six sense-organs are the first end,<br/>
					the other six outer objects are the second,<br/>
					consciousness is in the middle,<br/>
					and craving is the seamstress;<br/>
					for craving sews one<br/>
					just to this ever-becoming birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>
					a monk knows the knowable,<br/>
					comprehends the comprehensible;<br/>
					and knowing the knowable,<br/>
					comprehending the comprehensible,<br/>
					he makes an end of Ill,<br/>
					here now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And another said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Life's bundle<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> is the first end,<br/>
					its arising is the second,<br/>
					its ceasing is in the middle,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had finished speaking,<br/>
					another monk addressed the elders and said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'We have all, reverend sirs,<br/>
					replied as the matter appeared to each one of us.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let us go and visit the Exalted One<br/>
					and tell him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As the Exalted One declares,<br/>
					so will we bear in mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well,' rejoined the elders;<br/>
					and they approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted and sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And so seated, they told him all the words and talk that had passed between them, adding:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Lord, who spoke best?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Each one of you, monks,<br/>
					in his own way<br/>
					spoke well;<br/>
					but as to what I spoke of in<br/>
					"The Way to the Beyond,"<br/>
					in Metteyya's questions:</p>

					<p class="f4 in1"><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span> "Who knows both ends — not midst that sage is soiled:<br/>
					Him call I 'great man'; he here hath passed the seamstress."</p>

					<p class="f4">listen,<br/>
					pay good heed,<br/>
					I will speak!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Verily, contact, monks, is the first end,<br/>
					its arising is the second,<br/>
					its ceasing is in the middle,<br/>
					and craving is the seamstress;<br/>
					for craving sews a man<br/>
					just to this ever-becoming birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, it is to this extent<br/>
					that a monk knows the knowable,<br/>
					comprehends the comprehensible;<br/>
					and knowing the knowable,<br/>
					comprehending the comprehensible,<br/>
					he makes an end of Ill,<br/>
					here now.'</p>
