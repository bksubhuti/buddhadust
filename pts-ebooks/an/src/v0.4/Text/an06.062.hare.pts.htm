					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, while the Exalted One<br/>
					walked a walk among the Kosalese<br/>
					with a great company of the Order's monks,<br/>
					he came to a Kosalan town called Dandakappaka.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One<br/>
					stepped down from the road<br/>
					and sat on a seat made ready<br/>
					at the foot of a tree;<br/>
					but the monks entered Dandakappaka<br/>
					to seek a lodging.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					with a number of monks,<br/>
					went to the river Aciravatī<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					to bathe his limbs;<br/>
					and after he had bathed<br/>
					and had come out,<br/>
					he stood in one garment<br/>
					drying his limbs.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then a monk approached the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ānanda, reverend sir,<br/>
					was it after concentrating his whole mind<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					that Devadatta was declared by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Gone<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> wayward,<br/>
					hell-bound for a kalpa,<br/>
					unpardonable is Devadatta" -</p>

					<p class="f4">or was it from some deva-source<br/>
					(he learnt it)?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span> 'It was even as the Exalted One has declared.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and so seated,<br/>
					he told the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now I, bhante,<br/>
					with a number of monks,<br/>
					went to the river to bathe our limbs;<br/>
					and after I had bathed<br/>
					and had come out,<br/>
					I stood in one garment<br/>
					drying my limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a monk approached me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ānanda, reverend sir,<br/>
					was it after concentrating his whole mind<br/>
					that Devadatta was declared by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Gone wayward,<br/>
					hell-bound for a kalpa,<br/>
					unpardonable is Devadatta" -<br/>
					or was it from some deva-source?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I responded:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It was even as the Exalted One has declared.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(Then said the Exalted One:)</p>

					<p class="f4">'Either, Ānanda,<br/>
					that monk must be new,<br/>
					not long gone forth,<br/>
					or if an elder,<br/>
					a witless one.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, when I have definitely declared it,<br/>
					can there be an alternative?</p>

					<p class="f4">I know not another person<br/>
					of whom this was declared by me,<br/>
					after full mental concentration,<br/>
					save of Devadatta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so long, Ānanda,<br/>
					as I saw a bright spot<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> in Devadatta,<br/>
					even the prick-end of a horse-hair<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> in size,<br/>
					I declared not:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Gone wayward,<br/>
					hell-bound for a kalpa,<br/>
					unpardonable is Devadatta!"</p>

					<p class="f4">but it was when I saw none, that I declared:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Gone wayward,<br/>
					hell-bound for a kalpa,<br/>
					unpardonable is Devadatta!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Imagine,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> Ānanda,<br/>
					a cesspool,<br/>
					of a man's depth,<br/>
					brimful of dung<br/>
					and a man fallen in,<br/>
					head and all -<br/>
					though a man appear,<br/>
					ready to help,<br/>
					to do the friendly,<br/>
					to set him in safety,<br/>
					to lift him out;<br/>
					yet were he to go all round that cesspool,<br/>
					he would not see<br/>
					even the prick-end of a horse-hair of that man<br/>
					unsmeared with dung<br/>
					by which to grasp<br/>
					and lift him out.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is even so with Devadatta, Ānanda,<br/>
					when I saw not a bright spot in him -<br/>
					not even the prick-end of a horse-hair in size -<br/>
					then I declared:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Gone wayward,<br/>
