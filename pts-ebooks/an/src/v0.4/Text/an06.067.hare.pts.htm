					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Verily, monks, that a monk who is an evil friend,<br/>
					an evil comrade,<br/>
					an evil companion,<br/>
					serving,<br/>
					attending,<br/>
					honouring evil friends,<br/>
					emulating their ways of thought,<br/>
					shall fulfil the Dhamma-fore-course<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					that cannot be;</p>

					<p class="f4">and that without fulfilling the course,<br/>
					he shall fulfil the Dhamma-training -<br/>
					that cannot be;</p>

					<p class="f4">and that without fulfilling the training,<br/>
					he shall fulfil the virtues -<br/>
					that cannot be;</p>

					<p class="f4">and that without fulfilling the virtues,<br/>
					he shall give up lustful passion,<br/>
					passion for the material<br/>
					or for the immaterial -<br/>
					that cannot be.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But that a monk who is good friend,<br/>
					comrade,<br/>
					companion,<br/>
					serving,<br/>
					attending,<br/>
					honouring good friends,<br/>
					emulating their ways of thought,<br/>
					shall fulfil the Dhamma-fore-course -<br/>
					that surely shall be;</p>

					<p class="f4">and that on the fulfilment of the fore-course,<br/>
					he shall fulfil the training -<br/>
					that surely shall be;</p>

					<p class="f4">and that on the fulfilment of the training,<br/>
					he shall fulfil the virtues<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[298]</b></span> that surely shall be;</p>

					<p class="f4">and that on the fulfilment of the virtues,<br/>
					he shall give up lustful passion,<br/>
					passion for form<br/>
					and for the formless -<br/>
					that surely shall be.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="demi"/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Abhi-sam-ācār-ika dhamma;</i> see above V, § 21.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> It seems a jumble here, that <i>sīlāni</i> should not have come first, since they must be presupposed in the foregoing. Unless the four <i>brahma-vihāras</i> are meant by <i>sīlāni.</i> Possibly a corrupt recension.</p>
