					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> when the night was well advanced,<br/>
					a deva,<br/>
					shedding rays of far-reaching loveliness<br/>
					over Jeta Grove,<br/>
					visited the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and stood at one side;<br/>
					and, so standing,<br/>
					he spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, there are these six things<br/>
					that lead not to a monk's falling away.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverence for Teacher,<br/>
					reverence for the Dhamma<br/>
					reverence for the Order,<br/>
					reverence for the training,<br/>
					grace in speech<br/>
					and good friendship.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, these six things<br/>
					lead not to a monk's falling away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke that deva<br/>
					and the Teacher approved.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the deva,<br/>
					perceiving that the Master agreed,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and disappeared thence,<br/>
					keeping the Exalted One on his right.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, at the end of that night,<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the monks<br/>
					and told them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, when the night was well advanced,<br/>
					a deva,<br/>
					shedding rays of far-reaching loveliness<br/>
					over Jeta Grove,<br/>
					visited me,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and stood at one side;<br/>
					and, so standing,<br/>
					he spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, there are these six things<br/>

					<p class="f4">Reverence for Teacher,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Lord, these six things<br/>
					lead not to a monk's falling away."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke that deva and I approved.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the deva,<br/>
					perceiving that I agreed,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and disappeared thence,<br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[299]</b></span> And when he had spoken,<br/>
