					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk be possessed of six things,<br/>
					he cannot become this and that,<br/>
					so as to be bound personally to attain,<br/>
					given the opportunity.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[300]</b></span> Suppose, monks, a monk know not as a fact:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> things partake of failure,"</p>

					<p class="f4">or,</p>

					<p class="f4">"These things partake of stability,"</p>

					<p class="f4">or,</p>

					<p class="f4">"These things partake of distinction,"</p>

					<p class="f4">or,</p>

					<p class="f4">"These things partake of penetration,"</p>

					<p class="f4">nor is he zealous<br/>
					nor helpful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if a monk be possessed of these six,<br/>
					he cannot become this and that,<br/>
					so as to be bound personally to attain,<br/>
					given the opportunity.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>
					<p class="f4">But, monks, if a monk be possessed of six things,<br/>
					he can become this and that,<br/>
					so as to be bound personally to attain,<br/>
					given the opportunity.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, a monk know as a fact:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These things partake of failure,"</p>
