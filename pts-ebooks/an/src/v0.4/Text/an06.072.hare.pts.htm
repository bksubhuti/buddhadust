					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk be possessed of six things,<br/>
					he cannot win strength in concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, a monk be not skilled in attaining concentration,<br/>
					nor skilled in maintaining concentration,<br/>
					nor skilled in emerging therefrom,<br/>
					nor is he zealous,<br/>
					nor persevering<br/>
					nor helpful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if a monk be possessed of these six,<br/>
					he cannot win strength in concentration.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, if a monk be possessed of six things,<br/>
					he can win strength in concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, a monk be skilled in attaining concentration,<br/>
					skilled in maintaining concentration,<br/>
					skilled in emerging therefrom,<br/>
					is zealous,<br/>
					persevering<br/>
					helpful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if a monk be possessed of these six,<br/>
					he can win strength in concentration.'</p>
