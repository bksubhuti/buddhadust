					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk possess six things,<br/>
					he cannot attain unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>
					nor increase his skill attained therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is unskilled in entering,<br/>
					in leaving,<br/>
					in approach,<br/>
					has no wish to attain unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>
					preserves not his skill attained,<br/>
					nor stirs to persevere.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, if a monk possess these six,<br/>
					he cannot attain <span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span> unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>
					nor increase his skill attained therein.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, if a monk possess six things,<br/>
					he can attain unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>
					and increase his skill attained therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is skilled in entering,<br/>
					in leaving,<br/>
					in approach,<br/>
					has the wish to attain unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>
					preserves his skill attained,<br/>
					and stirs to persevere.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, if a monk possess these six things,<br/>
					he can attain unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>
					and increase his skill attained therein.</p>
