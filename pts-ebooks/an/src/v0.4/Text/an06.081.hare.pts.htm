					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, following six things,<br/>
					one is duly cast in hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">One takes life,<br/>
					takes what is not given,<br/>
					lives carnally,<br/>
					lies,<br/>
					has evil desires<br/>
					and wrong views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, following these six,<br/>
					one is duly cast in hell.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, following six things,<br/>
					one is duly cast in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">One abstains from taking life,<br/>
					one abstains from taking what is not given,<br/>
					one abstains from living carnally,<br/>
					one abstains from lies,<br/>
					one has few desires<br/>
					one has right views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, following these six,<br/>
					one is duly cast in heaven.'</p>
