					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, cumbered by six conditions,<br/>
					though one listen to Saddhamma,<br/>
					he cannot become one<br/>
					to enter the right way<br/>
					of right things.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has no desire to listen,<br/>
					incline the ear,<br/>
					apply a heart of understanding;<br/>
					when the Dhamma-discipline declared by the Tathāgata is taught,<br/>
					he grasps the profitless,<br/>
					rejects the profitable<br/>
					and possesses not himself in harmony and patience.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, cumbered by these six conditions,<br/>
					though one listen to Saddhamma,<br/>
					he cannot become one<br/>
					to enter the right way<br/>
					of right things.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, unencumbered by six conditions,<br/>
					if one listen to Saddhamma,<br/>
					he can become one<br/>
					to enter the right way<br/>
					of right things.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">He has desire to listen,<br/>
					incline the ear,<br/>
					apply a heart of understanding;<br/>
					when the Dhamma-discipline declared by the Tathāgata is taught,<br/>
					he grasps the profitable,<br/>
					rejects the profitless<br/>
					and possesses himself in harmony and patience.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, unencumbered by six conditions,<br/>
					if one listen to Saddhamma,<br/>
					he can become one<br/>
