					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, save one give up six things,<br/>
					he becomes one<br/>
					who cannot realize<br/>
					the achievement of right view.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">The wrong view of life's bundle,<br/>
					doubt,<br/>
					belief in the adequacy of rule and rite,<br/>
					passion that leads to the ill way,<br/>
					hate leads to the ill way,<br/>
					infatuation leads to the ill way.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[306]</b></span> Verily, monks, save one give up these six,<br/>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">But by giving up these six things,<br/>
					he becomes one<br/>
					who can realize<br/>
					the achievement of right view.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">The wrong view of life's bundle,<br/>
					doubt,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, by giving up these six things,<br/>
