					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six occasions which cannot become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">One who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot become one who will accept any phenomenon as permanent,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot accept any phenomenon as happiness,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot accept any thing as self,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot do an unpardonable act,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot fall back on curious ceremonies<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> for purification,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

						
						
					<p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot seek outside (the Order) for a gift-worthy.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the six occasions which cannot become.'</p>
