					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six occasions<br/>
					which cannot become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot become one<br/>
					who will fall back on the view<br/>
					that weal and woe<br/>
					are self-wrought;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot become one<br/>
					who will fall back on the view<br/>
					that weal and woe<br/>
					are wrought by another;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot become one<br/>
					who will fall back on the view<br/>
					that weal and woe<br/>
					are wrought both by oneself and another;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot become one<br/>
					who will fall back on the view<br/>
					that weal and woe<br/>
					arise by chance,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					are wrought without act of the self;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he who has achieved right view<br/>
					cannot become one<br/>
					who will fall back on the view<br/>
					that weal and woe<br/>
					arise by chance,<br/>
					are wrought without act of another;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he who has achieved right view<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly, monks, to one who has achieved right view<br/>
					cause and the causal origin of things<br/>
					are rightly discerned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the six occasions<br/>
					which cannot become.'</p>
