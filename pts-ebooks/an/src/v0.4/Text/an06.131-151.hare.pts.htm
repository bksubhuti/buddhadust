					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> I number differently from the text. For Pūraṇa and Isidatta, see above VI, § 44; Menṇḍaka at V, § 33; Ariṭṭha at K.S. v. 278, is a monk; for Vāseṭṭha see <i>D.</i> iii, 80; <i>M.</i> ii, 169; but these must be different; for Sandhāna see DA. i, 45; for Bhallika see p. 313, <i>A.</i> 3. Our <i>Comy.</i> mentions Tavakaññika only, observing <i>'evan nāmako gahupati'</i> which we already knew from the text! Is he connected with Tikñña of <i>G.S.</i> i, 145?</p>
