					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these are the seven powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of faith,<br/>
					energy,<br/>
					conscientiousness,<br/>
					fear of blame,<br/>
					mindfulness,<br/>
					concentration<br/>
					and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the seven.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the power of faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, monks, the Ariyan disciple who has faith;<br/>
					he believes thus of the tathāgata's awakening: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a truth he is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					fully awakened,<br/>
					adept in knowledge and conduct,<br/>
					well going,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					incomparable,<br/>
					a tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					among devas and men the teacher,<br/>
					Buddha,<br/>
					Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of faith.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the power of energy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the Ariyan disciple who abides stirred in energy<br/>
					to be rid of wrong things,<br/>
					to take to right things;<br/>
					he is steadfast,<br/>
					firm in advance,<br/>
					nor lays aside the yoke of righteousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the power of energy.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the power of conscientiousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the Ariyan disciple who is conscientious;<br/>
					he is shamed by misconduct in deed,<br/>
					word<br/>
					and thought;<br/>
					shamed at having fallen<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> into evil and unrighteous ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of conscientiousness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span> And what is the power of the fear of blame?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the Ariyan disciple who fears blame;<br/>
					he fears to be blamed for misconduct in deed,<br/>
					word<br/>
					and thought;<br/>
					he fears the blame of having fallen into evil and unrighteous ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of the fear of blame.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the power of mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the Ariyan disciple who is mindful;<br/>
					possessing a mastery of mindfulness in a high degree,<br/>
					he minds<br/>
					and reminds<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> himself<br/>
					of things done and said long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the power of concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the Ariyan disciple who is aloof from sense desire;<br/>
					aloof from evil ideas,<br/>
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>
					which is born of solitude<br/>
					and is full of zest and ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>
					which is self-evolved,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					full of zest and ease,<br/>
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br/>
					mindful and self-possessed,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>
					and experiences in his being<br/>
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease."</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br/>
					and is free of ease and ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of concentration.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the power of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the Ariyan disciple who is wise;<br/>
					he is wise as to the way of growth and decay,<br/>
					possessing Ariyan penetration of<br/>
					the way to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the seven powers.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Faith, energy, conscientiousness, fear of blame,<br/>
							Mindfulness, concentration, wisdom seventh -<br/>
							Well-armed with such the wise monk dwells at ease,<br/>
							Tests Dhamma's moulding, wisdom's goal discerns,<br/>
							And, as a quenched flame, is freed in heart.</p>
