					<p class="f4">The treasures of faith,<br/>
					virtue,<br/>

					there is a retaining,<br/>
					a storing of things heard;<br/>
					and those things,<br/>
					lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely in the end,<br/>
					which set forth in meaning and detail the godly life,<br/>
