					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these seven persons,<br/>
					like men in water,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, one person plunges once and drowns;<br/>
					one comes up and plunges again;<br/>
					one comes up and stays;<br/>
