					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>Once the Exalted One dwelt near Vesāli at Sārandada shrine;<br/>
					and there a number of Licchavis visited him and saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed them thus seated and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Licchavis, I will teach you seven things<br/>
					that cause not decline;<br/>
					listen,<br/>
					give heed,<br/>
					I will speak!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What seven things cause not decline?</p>

					<p class="f4">So long, O Licchavis,<br/>
					as the Vajjians shall be often assembled,<br/>
					much in assembly,<br/>
					growth for the Vajjians may be expected,<br/>
					not decline;</p>

					<p class="f4">so long as they shall not decree the undecreed<br/>

					<p class="f4">so long as they shall honour,<br/>

					<p class="f4">so long as they shall honour,<br/>
