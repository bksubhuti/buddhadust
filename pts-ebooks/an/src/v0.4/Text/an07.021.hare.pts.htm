					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, while dwelling on Mount Vulture Peak,<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you seven things that cause not decline;<br/>
					listen,<br/>
					pay heed,<br/>
					I win speak!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' the monks rejoined;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, are these seven things<br/>
					that cause not decline?</p>

					<p class="f4">So long as the monks shall be often assembled,<br/>
					much in assembly,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>
					not decline;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">so long as they shall sit down in concord,<br/>
					rise up in concord,<br/>
					do business in concord,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>
					not decline;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">so long as they shall not decree the undecreed,<br/>
					nor repeal the decreed,<br/>
					but conform to the decreed training,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>
					not decline;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">so long as they shall honour,<br/>
					respect,<br/>
					venerate;<br/>
					revere the elders,<br/>
					monks of experience,<br/>
					long gone forth,<br/>
					fathers of the Order,<br/>
					leaders of the Order,<br/>
					and deem them worthy to be heard,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>
					not decline;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">so long as they shall fall not into the power of craving's surge,<br/>
					the cause of renewed becoming,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>
					not decline;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">so long as they shall cleave<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> to the forest bed and seat,<br/>
					growth may be expected,<br/>
					not decline;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">so long as they shall each in himself make mindfulness stand up,<br/>
					and it shall be known<br/>
					that pious men in godly fellowship<br/>
					may come there from abroad<br/>
					and that those there dwell in comfort -<br/>
					growth may be expected for the monks,<br/>
					not decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so long as these seven things that cause not decline<br/>
					shall endure among the monks<br/>
					and they shall live in conformity therewith,<br/>
					growth may be expected, not decline.</p>
