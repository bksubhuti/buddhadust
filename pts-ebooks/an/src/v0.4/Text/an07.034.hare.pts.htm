					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this night a deva,<br/>
					whose surpassing loveliness<br/>
					lit up almost the whole of Jeta Grove,<br/>
					visited,<br/>
					saluted and stood at one side;<br/>
					and so standing,<br/>
					the deva spoke to me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, these seven things lead not to a monk's decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverence for the Master,<br/>
					Dhamma,<br/>
					Order,<br/>
					the training,<br/>
					concentration;<br/>
					fair speech<br/>
					and good friendship'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, lord, these seven things lead not to a monk's decline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake that deva, Monks,<br/>
					and I approved;<br/>
					and seeing this,<br/>
					the deva saluted<br/>
					and passed out on the right.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And when he had thus spoken,<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">4. 'This speech, lord, of the Exalted One,<br/>
