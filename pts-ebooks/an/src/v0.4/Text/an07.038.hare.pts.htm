					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, endowed with seven things,<br/>
					a monk makes the mind turn according to his wish<br/>
					and turns not by the mind's wish.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk is skilled in concentration,<br/>
					skilled in attaining it,<br/>
					skilled in maintaining it,<br/>
					skilled in emerging from it,<br/>
					skilled in the well-being of it,<br/>
					skilled in the range of it,<br/>
					skilled in applying it.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, endowed with these seven things<br/>
					a monk makes the mind turn according to his wish<br/>
