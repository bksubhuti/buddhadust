					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">One morning, while the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/> the venerable Sāriputta robed early and, taking cloak and bowl, entered Sāvatthī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Too soon still is it to visit Sāvatthī for alms;<br/>
					what if I go to the park of the wanderers of other views!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he approached their park;<br/>
					and, having come,<br/>
					greeted them,<br/>
					exchanged the usual polite talk with them<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time this remark<br/>
					by chance arose among them<br/>
					as they sat assembled:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, whosoever lives the godly life<br/>
					in its fullness and purity<br/>
					for twelve years,<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy.'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Sāriputta neither belauded nor decried their words,<br/>
					but got up and departed, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall learn the truth of this talk from the Exalted One."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when he had gone his round for alms in Sāvatthī<br/>
					and returned and eaten his meal,<br/>
					he approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and so seated,<br/>
					he told the <span class="f2 g"><b>[21]</b></span> Exalted One:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"This morning, lord, I robed early and, taking cloak and bowl, entered Sāvatthī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Too soon still is it to visit Sāvatthī for alms;<br/>
					what if I go to the park of the wanderers of other views!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I approached their park;<br/>
					and, having come,<br/>
					greeted them,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And I neither belauded nor decried their words,<br/>
					but got up and departed, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall learn the truth of this talk from the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it possible, lord,<br/>
					in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>
					to declare a monk praiseworthy<br/>
					just merely on the score of years?</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, Sāriputta, it is not possible<br/>
					in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>
					to declare a monk praiseworthy<br/>
					just merely on the score of years;<br/>
					these seven grounds for praise<br/>
					have been taught by me,<br/>
					who have realized the matter by personal knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the monk who is keenly eager to undergo the training<br/>
					and whose zeal wanes not in the days of his training;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">who is keenly eager to observe Dhamma<br/>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Sāriputta,<br/>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Sāriputta, if a monk, possessed of these seven grounds,<br/>
					live the godly life<br/>
					in its fullness and purity<br/>
					for twelve years,<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The monk is praiseworthy;"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">if he live the godly life for twenty-four years<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The monk is praiseworthy;"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>
					
					<p class="f4">for thirty-six years<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The monk is praiseworthy;"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>
					
					<p class="f4">for forty-eight years,<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>
