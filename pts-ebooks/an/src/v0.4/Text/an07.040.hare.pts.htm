					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying near Kosambī in Ghosita Park,<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda dressed early one morning<br/>
					and with bowl and robe entered Kosambī for alms.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Too soon still is it to visit Kosambī for alms;<br/>
					what if I go to the park of the wanderers of other views!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he approached their park;<br/>
					and, having come,<br/>
					greeted them,<br/>
					exchanged the usual polite talk with them<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time this remark<br/>
					by chance arose among them<br/>
					as they sat assembled:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, whosoever lives the godly life in its fullness and purity for twelve years,<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy.'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda neither belauded nor decried their words,<br/>
					but got up and departed, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall learn the truth of this talk from the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when he had gone his round for alms in Kosambī<br/>
					and returned and eaten his meal,<br/>
					he approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and so seated,<br/>
					he told the Exalted One:</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"This morning, lord, I robed early and, taking cloak and bowl, entered Kosambī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Too soon still is it to visit Kosambī for alms;<br/>
					what if I go to the park of the wanderers of other views!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I approached their park;<br/>
					and, having come,<br/>
					greeted them,<br/>
					exchanged the usual polite talk with them<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time this remark<br/>
					by chance arose among them<br/>
					as they sat assembled:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sirs, whosoever lives the godly life in its fullness and purity for twelve years,<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The monk is praiseworthy."'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I neither belauded nor decried their words,<br/>
					but got up and departed, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall learn the truth of this talk from the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span> Is it possible, lord,<br/>
					in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>
					to declare a monk praiseworthy<br/>
					just merely on the score of years?"</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Ānanda, it is not possible in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>
					to declare a monk praiseworthy<br/>
					just merely on the score of years;<br/>
					these seven grounds for praise<br/>
					have been taught by me,<br/>
					who have realized the matter by personal knowledge.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, a monk has faith,<br/>
					is conscientious,<br/>
					afraid of blame,<br/>
					has heard much,<br/>
					is energetic,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Ānanda,<br/>
					these are the seven grounds for praise taught by me,<br/>
					who have realized the matter by personal knowledge.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Ānanda, if a monk,<br/>
					possessed of these seven grounds,<br/>
					live the godly life in its fullness and purity<br/>
					for twelve years,<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy;'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">if he live the godly life<br/>
					for twenty-four years<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy;'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">for thirty-six years<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy;'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">for forty-eight years,<br/>
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy;'"</p>
