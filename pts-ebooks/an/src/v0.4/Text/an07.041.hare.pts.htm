					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these seven stations of survival.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings diverse in body,<br/>
					diverse in mind;<br/>
					for example men,<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> some devas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					and some who are utterly cast down.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first station of survival.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings diverse in body<br/>
					but uniform in mind;<br/>
					for example devas reborn in Brahma's world<br/>
					by reason of first (musing).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second station.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span> There are beings uniform in body<br/>
					but diverse in mind;<br/>
					for example the radiant devas.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third station.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings uniform in body,<br/>
					uniform in mind;<br/>
					for example the lustrous devas.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth station.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings, wholly gone beyond thoughts of form,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					gone to rest as to sense-reactions,<br/>
					who, disregarding thoughts of the manifold,<br/>
					have reached the sphere of infinite space, knowing,<br/>
					"Infinite is space!"</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth station.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings, wholly gone beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br/>
					who have reached the sphere of infinite consciousness, knowing,<br/>
					"Infinite is consciousness!"</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth station.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings, wholly gone beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					who have reached the sphere of nothing whatever, knowing,<br/>
					"There is nothing whatever!"</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the seventh station.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the seven stations of survival.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> Even twins differ in speech, gait, etc.; as to mind, at rebirth there are three or two or no good conditions or motives, see <i>Cpd.</i> 50.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> Devas in the sense-world (<i>Kāmaloka</i>); some have blue bodies, some yellow and so forth; their minds are conditioned as in the case of men's.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> They vary in size; their minds depend on first musing efficiency. See <i>Cpd.</i> 138 <i>ff.</i> for these and the following devas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> These do not radiate light in flashes; they are practised in the fourth musing.</p>
