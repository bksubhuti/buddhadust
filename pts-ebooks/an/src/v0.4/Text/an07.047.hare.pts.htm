					Maras,<br/>
					Brahmās,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then to me gnosis,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Immovable is my mind-emancipation,<br/>

					there is no becoming (here) again!'"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken, brāhman Jānussoṇi said to the Exalted One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It's amazing, Master Gotama,<br/>
					<br/>
					amazing, Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br/>
					one might set upright what had been upset,<br/>
					or might disclose what was covered,<br/>
					or point out the way<br/>
					to one who had gone astray,<br/>
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br/>
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br/>
					even so is <i>dhamma</i> made clear<br/>
					in many a figure by the good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,<br/>
					and to <i>dhamma</i><br/>
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the good Gotama accept me<br/>
					as a lay-disciple,<br/>
					one gone for refuge from today forth<br/>
					for as long as life lasts."</p>
