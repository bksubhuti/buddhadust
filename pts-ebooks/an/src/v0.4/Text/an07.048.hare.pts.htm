					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you a Dhamma-discourse<br/>
					on bondage and on bond-freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pay heed,<br/>
					listen well,<br/>
					I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord" the monks rejoined;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the discourse<br/>
					on bondage and on bond-freedom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a woman marks femininity<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> in herself,<br/>
					the feminine occupation,<br/>
					attire,<br/>
					prejudices,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					impulses,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					voice,<br/>
					charm.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is excited by that,<br/>
					delighted by that;<br/>
					and being so excited,<br/>
					delighted,<br/>
					she marks masculinity about her,<br/>
					the masculine occupation,<br/>
					attire,<br/>
					prejudices,<br/>
					impulses,<br/>
					voice,<br/>
					charm.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is excited by that,<br/>
					delighted by that;<br/>
					and being so excited,<br/>
					delighted,<br/>
					she desires a bond<br/>
					with those about her;<br/>
					and whatsoever happiness,<br/>
					well-being<br/>
					comes of this bond<br/>
					that she desires.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[33]</b></span> Monks, delighted by,<br/>
					attached to her own sex,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					she has gone into man's bondage<br/>
					and thus escapes not from her own sex.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, a man marks masculinity in himself,<br/>
					the masculine occupation,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He is excited by that,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And what, Monks, is the Dhamma-discourse on bond-freedom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a woman does not mark femininity in herself,<br/>

					<p class="f4">She is not excited by that,<br/>
