					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[35]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable MahāMoggallāna<br/>
					with a company of the monks of the Order<br/>
					walked a walk near<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> South Hill;<br/>
					and it was then that Nanda's mother,<br/>
					a lay-disciple of Veḷukaṇḍa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					rose before dawn one night and sang the 'Way to the Beyond.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>
						
						

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Royal deva, Vessavaṇa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					was going <span class="f2 g"><b>[36]</b></span> from the north to the southern quarter<br/>
					on some business or other;<br/>
					and he heard Nanda's mother singing<br/>
					and stopped and waited for the end.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when she had finished, she was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Royal deva, Vessavaṇa,<br/>
					perceiving she had finished,<br/>
					rejoiced greatly, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done, sister, well done!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But who is it, O thou of august countenance?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Sister,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> it is I, your brother,<br/>
					the Royal deva, Vessavaṇa,!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hail, august One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Prithee, let this Dhamma-hymn sung by me<br/>
					be thy gift<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> of greeting."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done, sister!</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, let this, verily, be my gift of greeting!</p>

					<p class="f4">Tomorrow, monks of the Order with Sāriputta and Moggallāna at their head<br/>
					will come to Veḷukaṇḍa,<br/>
					not having had their morning meal;<br/>
					when you have fed them,<br/>
					you should declare the offering to be mine<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					and it shall be my gift of greeting."</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the night was over,<br/>
					Nanda's mother had much hard and soft food<br/>
					prepared in her house.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the monks of the Order,<br/>
					with Sāriputta and Moggallāna at their head,<br/>
					arrived at Veḷukaṇḍa,<br/>
					having had no morning meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Nanda's mother called a man and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go, my good man, to the monks' park and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is time, reverend sirs;<br/>
					the meal is ready<br/>
					in the lady Nanda's mother's house.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lady," he replied, and<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> going to the monks' park, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is time, reverend sirs;<br/>
					the meal is ready<br/>
					in the lady Nanda's mother's house."</p>

					<p class="f4">And dressing early,<br/>
					taking bowl and robe,<br/>
					the monks, with Sāriputta and Moggallāna at their head,<br/>
					came to Nanda's mother's house<br/>
					and sat down on the seats arranged there.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[37]</b></span> And the lay-disciple, Nanda's mother,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					served them with her own hands<br/>
					with much hard and soft food<br/>
					and satisfied them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the venerable Sāriputta had eaten<br/>
					and withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br/>
					Nanda's mother sat down at one side;<br/>
					and he said to her, seated thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But who told you, O mother of Nanda,<br/>
					of the coming of the monks of the Order?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sir, I arose in the night before dawn,<br/>
					I sang the 'Way to the Beyond' and was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then came the Royal deva Vessavana,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>
					perceiving I had finished,<br/>
					rejoiced greatly, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well done, sister, well done!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But who is it, O thou of august countenance?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sister, it is I, your brother,<br/>
					the Royal deva, Vessavaṇa,!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Hail, august One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Prithee, let this Dhamma-hymn sung by me<br/>
					be thy gift of greeting.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well done, sister!</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, let this, verily, be my gift of greeting!</p>

					<p class="f4">Tomorrow, monks of the Order with Sāriputta and Moggallāna at their head<br/>
					will come to Veḷukaṇḍa,<br/>
					not having had their morning meal;<br/>
					when you have fed them,<br/>
					you should declare the offering to be mine -<br/>
					and it shall be my gift of greeting.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend sir, let all the merit<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> in this giving<br/>
					be to the happiness of the Royal deva Vessavaṇa!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous and wonderful, O mother of Nanda,<br/>
					that you should talk face to face<br/>
					with a deva<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> so powerful,<br/>
					so mighty!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sir, that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br/>
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">Rajahs, for some reason,<br/>
					took by force and slew my only son, Nanda,<br/>
					who was dear and precious to me;<br/>
					yet when the boy was seized<br/>
					or being seized,<br/>
					bound<br/>
					or being bound,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/>
					slain<br/>
					or being slain,<br/>
					I knew no disquietness<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> of heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous and wonderful, O mother of Nanda,<br/>
					that you should have so purged the surges of the heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br/>
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br/>
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">When my husband died,<br/>
					he rose among the yakkhas;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span><br/>
					and he revealed himself to me in his old form;<br/>
					but I knew no disquietness of heart on that account."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span> "It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda,<br/>
					that you should have so purged the surges of the heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br/>
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br/>
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">From the day I, a young girl,<br/>
					was brought to my husband,<br/>
					then but a youth,<br/>
					I know of no trespass<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span><br/>
					even in thought<br/>
					against my husband,<br/>
					how then in deed?</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda, that you should have so purged the surges of the heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br/>
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br/>
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">From the day I became a confessed lay-disciple,<br/>
					I know of no intentional transgression<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span><br/>
					of any step of the training."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda, it is wonderful!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br/>
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br/>
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">For just as long as I wish,<br/>
					being aloof from sense desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil thoughts,<br/>
					I enter and abide in the first musing,<br/>
					where thought is speculative,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span> deliberative,<br/>
					where zest and ease are born of solitude:<br/>
					suppressing such thought,<br/>
					I enter and abide in the second musing,<br/>
					where there is an inward tranquillizing of the mind,<br/>
					a one-pointedness<br/>
					free from speculation,<br/>
					deliberation,<br/>
					where zest and ease are born of concentration:<br/>
					then, free from the fervour of zest,<br/>
					I enter and abide in the third musing,<br/>
					I abide poised,<br/>
					mindful,<br/>
					self-possessed,<br/>
					I experience the ease of person whereof Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The poised and mindful dwells at ease":</p>

					<p class="f4">then by putting away ease,<br/>
					by putting away ill,<br/>
					by the passing away of former weal and woe of mind,<br/>
					I enter and abide in the fourth musing,<br/>
					a purity that is poise and mindfulness,<br/>
					which is neither ill nor ease."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda, it is wonderful!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sir, that is not all, there is yet another marvellous thing!</p>

					<p class="f4">Those five lower fetters,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span> declared by the Exalted One -<br/>
					I perceive not one in myself unabandoned."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous, wonderful, mother of Nanda!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta instructed Nanda's mother with Dhamma-talk,<br/>
					incited her,<br/>
					inspired her,<br/>
					gladdened her;<br/>
					and rising from his seat,<br/>
					he departed.</p>
