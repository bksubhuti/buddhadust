					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> need not be cloaked by the Tathāgata,<br/>
					and of three he is blameless.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">What four need not be cloaked?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in bodily act the Tathāgata is wholly pure;<br/>
					there is no wrongdoing in deed by the Tathāgata<br/>
					which he would cloak, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let none know this of me."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in act of word the Tathāgata is wholly pure;<br/>
					there is no wrongdoing in word by the Tathāgata<br/>
					which he would cloak, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let none know this of me."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in act of thought the Tathāgata is wholly pure;<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in mode of living<br/>
					the Tathāgata is wholly pure;<br/>
					there is no wrong mode of living by the Tathāgata<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Let none know this of me."</p>

					<p class="f4">These four need not be cloaked by the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what three is he blameless?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the Tathāgata's Dhamma is well proclaimed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, truly, a recluse, brahman, deva, Mara, Brahmā<br/>
					or anyone in the world<br/>
					might with justice blame me, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> has Dhamma not been well proclaimed by you."</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, I see no sign of this;<br/>

					I abide won to peace,<br/>
					won to fearlessness,<br/>
					won to confidence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, well made known by me to listeners<br/>

					<p class="f4">Of these three he is blameless.</p>
