					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying in the Bamboo Grove near Kimbila,<br/>
					the venerable Kimbila approached him,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, what is the cause,<br/>
					the reason why,<br/>
					when the Tathāgata has become completely cool,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Kimbila, when the Tathāgata has become completely cool,<br/>
					the monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen<br/>
					live without reverence, without heed for the teacher<br/>
					live without reverence, without heed for the Dhamma<br/>
					live without reverence, without heed for the the Order<br/>
					live without reverence, without heed for the the training<br/>
					live without reverence, without heed for concentration<br/>
					live without reverence, without heed for earnestness,<br/>
					live without reverence, without heed for goodwill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Kimbila, this is the cause,<br/>
					the reason why,<br/>
					when the Tathāgata has become completely cool,<br/>
					Saddhamma will not last.'</p>
