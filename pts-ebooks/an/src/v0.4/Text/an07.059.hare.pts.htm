					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park</p>

					<p class="f4">'And early one morning,<br/>
					after robing himself,<br/>
					the Exalted One, taking bowl and cloak,<br/>
					went to the home of Anāthapiṇḍika, the householder;<br/>
					and when he was come,<br/>
					he sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the people of the house were making a great noise and clatter;<br/>
					and when Anāthapiṇḍika had come and saluted him<br/>
					and had sat down at one side,<br/>
					the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why, housefather, do the people of your house<br/>
					make all this din and uproar?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like fisherfolk<br/>
					with a great haul,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> methinks!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, it is Sujata,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> my daughter-in-law,<br/>
					who lives with us.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is rich and has been brought here from a wealthy family.</p>

					<p class="f4">She pays no heed to her mother-in-law,<br/>
					nor to her father-in-law,<br/>
					nor to her husband;<br/>
					neither does she venerate,<br/>
					honour,<br/>
					reverence<br/>
					nor respect the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One called to her, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, Sujata!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' she replied,<br/>
					and came and saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sujata, a man may have these seven kinds of wives.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">One like a slayer,<br/>
					one like a robber,<br/>
					one like a mistress,<br/>
					one like a mother,<br/>
					one like a sister,<br/>
					one like a companion<br/>
					and one like a handmaid.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These, Sujata, are the seven;<br/>
					and which of them are you?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span> 'Lord, I do not fully understand<br/>
					what the Exalted One has put so briefly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me, lord,<br/>
					if the Exalted One would teach me Dhamma,<br/>
					so that I may understand the meaning of the words<br/>
					spoken so tersely by the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">' Then pay heed,<br/>
					listen,<br/>
					I will speak, Sujata.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' she replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Whoso is pitiless, corrupt in mind,<br/>
							Neglecting husband and unamiable,<br/>
							Inflamed by other men, a prostitute,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
							On murder bent -<br/>
							Let her be called: a slayer and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoso would rob her husband of his gains-<br/>
							Though little be the profit that he makes,<br/>
							Whether by craftsmanship, or from his trade,<br/>
							Or by the plough -<br/>
							Let her be called: a robber and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The slothful glutton, bent on doing nothing,<br/>
							A gossip and a shrew with strident voice,<br/>
							Who brings to low account her husband's zeal<br/>
							And industry -<br/>
							Let her be called: a mistress and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoever and with loving sympathy,<br/>
							Just as a mother for her only son,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
							For husband cares, and o'er his stored-up wealth<br/>
							Keeps watch and ward -<br/>
							Let her be called: a mother and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Who holds her husband in the same regard<br/>
							As younger sister holds the elder born,<br/>
							The meek in heart, who in his every wish<br/>
							Her husband serves -<br/>
							Let her be called: a sister and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span> And she who is as glad her lord to see<br/>
							As boon companions long apart to meet,<br/>
							A gracious character of gentle birth,<br/>
							A fond helpmate -<br/>
							Let her be called: companion and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">If fearless of the lash and stick,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> unmoved,<br/>
							All things enduring, calm and pure in heart,<br/>
							She bear obedience to her husband's word,<br/>
							From anger free -<br/>
							Let her be called: a handmaid<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Now she who's called: a mistress, slayer, thief,<br/>
							Who's harsh, immoral, lacking in respect,<br/>
							When cometh death -<br/>
							Will wander in the miseries of hell.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">But mother, sister or companion, slave,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>
							In precept long established and restrained,<br/>
							When cometh death -<br/>
							Will wander in the happy heaven world.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These, Sujata, are the seven kinds of wives a man may have;<br/>
					and which of them are you?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, let the Exalted One think of me as a handmaid<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> and a wife<br/>
					from this day forth.'</p>
