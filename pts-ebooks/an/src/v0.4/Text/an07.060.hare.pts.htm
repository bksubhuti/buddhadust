					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these seven conditions,<br/>
					fostered by rivals,<br/>
					causing rivals,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[59]</b></span> Monks, there is the case of the rival,<br/>
					who wishes thus of a rival:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Would that he were ugly!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">A rival, monks, does not like a handsome rival.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this sort of person,<br/>
					being angry,<br/>
					is overwhelmed by anger;<br/>
					he is subverted by anger:<br/>
					and however well he be bathed, anointed, trimmed<br/>
					as to the hair and beard,<br/>
					clad in spotless linen;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					yet for all that he is ugly,<br/>
					being overwhelmed by anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the first condition,<br/>
					fostered by rivals,<br/>
					causing rivals,<br/>
					which comes upon an angry woman or man.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this sort of person,<br/>

					is overwhelmed by anger;<br/>

					which comes upon an angry woman or man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this sort of person,<br/>

					<p class="f4">making a profit, he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have made a loss."</p>

					<p class="f4">Overwhelmed by anger,<br/>
					these things cause enmity towards others;<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the third condition,<br/>

					causing rivals,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Again, there is the case of the rival,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">A rival, monks, does not like a rival to be wealthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this sort <span class="f2 g"><b>[60]</b></span> of person,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the fourth condition,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the fifth condition,<br/>

					causing rivals,<br/>
					which comes upon an angry woman or man.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, there is the case of the rival,<br/>

					because he is overwhelmed by anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the sixth condition,<br/>
					fostered by rivals,<br/>
					causing rivals,<br/>
					which comes upon an angry woman or man.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, there is the case of the rival,<br/>
					who wishes thus of a rival:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Would that on the breaking up of the body after death<br/>

					the ill way,<br/>
					the abyss,<br/>
					hell!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">A rival, monks, does not like a rival to go to heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this sort of person,<br/>

					is overwhelmed by anger;<br/>
					he is subverted by anger:<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the seventh condition,<br/>
					fostered by rivals,<br/>
					causing rivals,<br/>
					which comes upon an angry <span class="f2 g"><b>[61]</b></span> woman or man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the seven conditions,<br/>
					fostered by rivals,<br/>
					causing rivals,<br/>
					which come upon an angry woman or man.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">How ugly is an angry man! His sleep<br/>
							Is comfortless; with fortune in his hands<br/>
							He suffers loss; and being full of wrath<br/>
							He wounds by act and (bitter) word. O'erwhelmed<br/>
							By rage, his wealth he wastes away. Made mad<br/>
							And crazy by his bile, his name's bemired<br/>
							With odium.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> Shunned and forsaken is<br/>
							An angry man by friend and relative.<br/>
							By<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> wrath is loss incurred; by wrath the mind<br/>
							Is racked. Irate, he knows not that within<br/>
							Fear is engendered, nor knows the goal.<br/>
							When anger-bound, man Dhamma cannot see;<br/>
							When anger conquers man, blind darkness reigns.<br/>
							A man in wrath finds pleasure<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> in bad deeds<br/>
							As in good deeds; yet later, when his wrath<br/>
							Is spent, he suffers like one scorched by fire:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>
							As flame atop of smoke, he staggers on,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/>
							When anger spreads,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> when youth becomes incensed.<br/>
							No shame, no fear of blame, no reverence<br/>
							In speech<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> has he whose mind is anger rent;<br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[62]</b></span> No island of support<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> he ever finds.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The deeds which bring remorse,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span> far from right states,<br/>
							These I'll proclaim. List how they come about.<br/>
							A man in anger will his father kill,<br/>
							In wrath, his very mother will he slay,<br/>
							Brāhman<span class="f3"><sup>18</sup></span> and common folk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span> alike he'll kill.<br/>
							'Tis but by mother's care man sees the light<br/>
							Of day, yet common average folk, in wrath,<br/>
							Will still destroy that fount of life (and love).<br/>
							Self-mirrored all these beings are; each one<br/>
							Loves most the self. In wrath the common folk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span><br/>
							Kill self, by divers forms distraught: by sword<br/>
							Men kill the self; in madness poison take;<br/>
							And in some hollow of a mountain glen<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span><br/>
							They hide, and bind themselves with ropes and die.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Thus ruin runs in wake of wrath, and they,<br/>
							Who act in wrath, perceive not that their deeds,<br/>
							Destroying life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span> bring death unto the self.<br/>
							Thus lurking in the heart is Mara's snare<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a></sup></span><br/>
							In anger's loathsome form. But root it out<br/>
							By insight, zeal, right view, restraint; the wise<br/>
							Would one by one each evil state root out<br/>
							And thus in Dhamma would he train himself:<br/>
							Be not our minds obscured, but anger freed<br/>
							And freed from trouble, greed and coveting.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The well controlled, the canker-freed, become,<br/>
							When anger's stilled, wholly, completely cool.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a></sup></span></p>
