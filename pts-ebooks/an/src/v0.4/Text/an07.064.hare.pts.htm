					<p class="f4">8. And how is he a noble and base person-knower?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, persons are known to a monk in two ways:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of two persons, one desires to see the Ariyans,<br/>
					the other does not.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, who has no desire to see the Ariyans,<br/>
					is to be blamed for that reason;<br/>
					but the other,<br/>
					because he desires to see the Ariyans,<br/>
					is to be commended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of two, who desire to see the Ariyans,<br/>
					one desires to hear Saddhamma,<br/>
					the other does not.</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter is to be blamed for that reason,<br/>
					the former is to be commended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of two, who desire to hear Saddhamma,<br/>
					one listens to Dhamma with ready ear,<br/>
					the other does not.</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter is to be blamed,<br/>
					the former is to be commended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of two, who listen to Dhamma with ready ear,<br/>
					one, having heard it, is mindful of Dhamma,<br/>
					the other is not.</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter is to be blamed,<br/>
					the former is to be commended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of two, who, having heard it,<br/>
					are mindful of Dhamma,<br/>
					one tests the truth of the doctrines he has learnt,<br/>
					the other does not.</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter is to be blamed,<br/>
					the former is to be commended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of two, who test the truth of the doctrines learnt,<br/>
					one knowing the letter and the spirit,<br/>
					walks in conformity with Dhamma,<br/>
					the other does not.</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter is to be blamed,<br/>
					the former is to be commended.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Of two persons, who,<br/>
					knowing the letter and the spirit,<br/>
					walk in conformity with Dhamma,<br/>
					one conforms for his own benefit,<br/>
					but not for others;<br/>
					the other conforms both for his own benefit<br/>
					and for the benefit of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">The person, who conforms for his own benefit<br/>
					and not for others,<br/>
					is to be blamed for that reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">The person, who conforms both for his own benefit<br/>
					and for the benefit of others,<br/>
					is to be commended for that reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, persons are known to a monk in two ways;<br/>
					and thus a monk is a knower of noble and base persons.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span> Verily, monks, endowed with these seven qualities, a monk is worthy of offerings,<br/>
