					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At Sāvatthī</p>

					<p class="f4">Now there arose in the mind of the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					as he sat alone in seclusion,<br/>
					this reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If a monk would abandon unrighteous ways,<br/>
					if he would make righteousness become,<br/>
					whom should he respect,<br/>
					whom should he revere<br/>
					and on whom should he rely?</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>
					<p class="f4">Then thought the venerable one:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let a monk respect, revere and rely on the Teacher,<br/>
					if he would abandon unrighteous ways<br/>
					and make righteousness become.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him respect, revere and rely on concentration,<br/>

					and make righteousness become.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him respect, revere and rely on earnestness,<br/>

					and make righteousness become.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him respect, revere and rely on goodwill,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought he:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These things in me have been cleared and purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to go and tell them to the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">They will become both purified within me<br/>
					and better reckoned so.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">For, just as a man might come upon a gold ring,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					of pure and sterling quality, and think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This ring of mine is of pure and sterling gold,<br/>
					but what if I were to go and show it to the goldsmiths!</p>

					<p class="f4">My ring of gold, passed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> by them,<br/>
					will <span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span> be both purified<br/>

					<p class="f4">even so, when I have gone and told the Exalted One,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, indeed, the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					at eventide,<br/>
					arose from seclusion<br/>
					and approached the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having come,<br/>
					he saluted the Exalted One<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, as I sat alone in seclusion,<br/>
					this reflection arose in my mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whom should a monk respect,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">These things are cleared and purified within me,<br/>
					but if I were to speak about them to the Exalted One,<br/>
					they would be both purified<br/>
					and better reckoned so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to find a gold ring of pure and sterling quality, and think:</p>
