					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of seven qualities, a monk, skilled in the discipline, is illustrious.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows what is an offence;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">what is not;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">what is trifling;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">what is grave;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he calls to mind divers dwellings in the past, to wit:<br/>
					one birth, or two, or three, or four, or five,<br/>
					or ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty,<br/>
					or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand,<br/>
					or many an age of rolling on,<br/>
					or many an age of rolling back,<br/>
					or many an age of both rolling on and rolling back -<br/>
					such an one I was by name,<br/>
					of such a clan,<br/>
					of such a caste,<br/>
					such was my food,<br/>
					such my experience of weal and woe,<br/>
					such was the end of my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing away thence,<br/>
					I arose in such a place.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, such was my name,<br/>
					such my clan,<br/>
					such my caste,<br/>
					such my food,<br/>
					such my experience of weal and woe,<br/>
					such my end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing away from there,<br/>
					I arose here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many a previous dwelling<br/>
					he calls to mind<br/>
					with its circumstances and details.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">With the deva-eye sublime,<br/>
					surpassing the eye of man<br/>
					he sees and knows beings<br/>
					in course of faring on -<br/>
					beings lowly and exalted,<br/>
					beautiful and ugly,<br/>
					happy and in woe,<br/>
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These worthies were given over to evil practices<br/>
					in act, word and thought,<br/>
					were revilers of the Ariyans,<br/>
					holders of wrong views,<br/>
					men who have acquired this karma<br/>
					from wrong views;<br/>
					and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>
					have arisen in the untoward way,<br/>
					the ill way,<br/>
					the abyss,<br/>
					hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these good sirs behaved rightly<br/>
					in act, word and thought,<br/>
					were no revilers of the Ariyans,<br/>
					held right views<br/>
					and have acquired this karma therefrom;<br/>
					and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>
					have arisen in the blissful heaven world."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the deva-eye<br/>
					purified and surpassing the human eye,<br/>
					he sees and knows beings<br/>
					in course of faring on -<br/>
					beings lowly and exalted,<br/>
					beautiful and ugly,<br/>
					happy and in woe,<br/>
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart and wisdom,<br/>
					which is cankerless,<br/>
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br/>
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, possessed of seven qualities, a monk, skilled in the discipline, is illustrious.</p>
