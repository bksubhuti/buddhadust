					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk possessed of eight qualities<br/>
					is neither dear,<br/>
					nor pleasing to,<br/>
					nor honoured,<br/>
					by his fellows in the godly life,<br/>
					nor what he ought to become.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk praises those who are not dear;<br/>
					he blames those who are dear;<br/>
					he longs for possessions;<br/>
					he longs for honour;<br/>
					he is not conscientious;<br/>
					he is without fear of blame;<br/>
					he has evil intentions;<br/>
					and he holds wrong views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessed of these eight qualities<br/>
					a monk is neither dear,<br/>
					nor pleasing to,<br/>
					nor honoured by his fellows in the godly life,<br/>
					nor what he ought to become.</p>
