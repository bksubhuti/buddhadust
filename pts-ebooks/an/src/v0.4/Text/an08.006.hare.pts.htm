					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these eight worldly conditions obsess the world;<br/>
					the world revolves round<br/>
					these eight worldly conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Gain and loss,<br/>
					fame and obscurity,<br/>
					blame and praise,<br/>
					contentment and pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these eight worldly conditions obsess the world,<br/>
					the world revolves round<br/>
					these eight worldly conditions.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, to the unlearned common average folk<br/>
					come gain,<br/>
					loss,<br/>
					fame,<br/>
					obscurity,<br/>
					blame,<br/>
					praise,<br/>
					contentment,<br/>
					pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the learned Ariyan disciple also come gain,<br/>
					loss,<br/>
					fame,<br/>
					obscurity,<br/>
					blame,<br/>
					praise,<br/>
					contentment,<br/>
					pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here then, monks, what is the distinction,<br/>
					what is the peculiarity<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of,<br/>
					and what is the difference between the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					and common average folk?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, our doctrines have their foundation in the Exalted One,<br/>
					they are guided by the Exalted One,<br/>
					they have the Exalted's One's protection!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it for us,<br/>
					if the Exalted One would expound the meaning of his speech to us.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the monks have beard the Exalted One,<br/>
					they will treasure his words in their hearts.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>
