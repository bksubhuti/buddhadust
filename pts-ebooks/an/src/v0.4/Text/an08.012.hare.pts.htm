					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>Once the Exalted One was dwelling in the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana, near Vesālī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a great many Licchavi notables were seated assembled in the Mote Hall;<br/>
					and in many a figure they were speaking in praise of the Buddha,<br/>
					in praise of Dhamma,<br/>
					in praise of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Sīha, the general, the disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> was seated in that assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought he:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely that Exalted One must be arahant,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus indeed these many notable Licchavis,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now suppose I were to go and see him,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then Sīha approached the Nigaṇṭha, Nāṭaputa and said to him:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought Sīha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Undoubtedly that Exalted One is arahant,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So at noon, Sīha set out from Vesālī<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, the time has come,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One, robing himself early in the morning,<br/>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then many Nigaṇṭhas went about Vesālī,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man went and whispered in Sīha's ear, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I say, sir, are you aware<br/>
					that a great many Nigaṇṭhas<br/>
					go about the streets and cross-roads of Vesālī,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, sirrah!</p>

						

					<p class="f4">For a long time these worthies have longed to disparage the Buddha,<br/>

					served and <span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span> satisfied the Order of monks<br/>
					with the Buddha at their head<br/>
					with plenty of food,<br/>
					both hard and soft;<br/>
					and when the Exalted One had finished eating<br/>
					and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br/>
					Sīha sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Exalted One instructed Sīha<br/>
