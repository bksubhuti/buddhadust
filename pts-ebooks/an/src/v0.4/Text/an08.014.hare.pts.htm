					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'Monks, I will define eight excitable<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> horses<br/>
					and their eight vices,<br/>
					eight excitable men<br/>
					and their eight vices.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen well,<br/>
					pay heed,<br/>
					I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Monks, what are the eight excitable horses<br/>
					and their eight vices?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br/>
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br/>
					he backs<br/>
					and twists the carriage round<br/>
					with his hind-quarters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br/>
					and this is his first vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Again monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br/>
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br/>
					he jumps back,<br/>
					batters against the carriage railing<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and breaks the triple bar.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br/>
					and this is his second vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Again monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br/>
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br/>
					he looses<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> his hind-quarters from the pole<br/>
					and tramples on it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br/>
					and this is his third vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Again monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br/>
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br/>
					he takes the wrong road<br/>
					and makes the carriage go awry.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br/>
					and this is his fourth vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Again monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br/>
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br/>
					he tosses high his breast and paws (the air).</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br/>
					and this is his fifth vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Again monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br/>
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br/>
					heedless of the driver and the goad,<br/>
					he champs the bit<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> with his teeth and wanders at random.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br/>
					and this is his sixth vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Again monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br/>
					being beaten and<br/>
					when urged by the driver,<br/>
					he goes neither on nor back,<br/>
					but halts and stands like a post.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br/>
					and this is his seventh vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">10. Moreover, monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br/>
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br/>
					he draws together his fore and hind legs<br/>
					and just sits down there on his four feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, is an excitable horse<br/>
					and this is his eighth vice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the eight excitable horses<br/>
					and their eight vices.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">11. And what, monks, are the eight excitable men<br/>
					and their eight vices?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br/>
					and he, being thus reproved,<br/>
					evades (the matter by a plea) of forgetfulness, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I don't remember! I don't remember!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as an excitable horse,<br/>
					when beaten and urged by his driver,<br/>

					like that, I say, is this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable man<br/>
					and this is his first vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">12. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br/>
					and he, being thus reproved,<br/>
					blurts out at his reprover:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What right have you to talk,<br/>
					an ignorant fool?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do you think you must speak?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br/>

					<p class="f4">13. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br/>
					and he, being thus reproved, retorts:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, <i>you</i> too committed such and such an offence.</p>

					<p class="f4">You had best make amends first!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br/>
					when beaten and urged by his driver,<br/>
					looses his hind-quarters from the pole<br/>

					<p class="f4">14. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br/>

					evades the question by another,<br/>
					turns the issue aside and shows temper,<br/>
					ill-will<br/>
					and sulkiness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">15. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br/>
					and he, being thus reproved,<br/>
					speaks when the Order is in conclave,<br/>
					with much gesticulation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br/>
					when beaten and urged by his driver,<br/>
					tosses high his breast and paws the air;<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">16. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br/>
					and he, being thus reproved,<br/>
					pays no attention to the Order,<br/>
					nor heeds his reprover,<br/>
					but wanders about at random,<br/>
					like an offender.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable man<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">17. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"But <i>I've</i> not committed an offence.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, <i>I've</i> not offended."</p>

					<p class="f4">And he vexes the Order by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br/>

					goes neither on nor back<br/>
					but just halts and stands like a post;<br/>

					<p class="f4">18. Moreover, monks, when the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br/>
					he, being thus reproved by them, says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, why worry<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> so much about me?</p>

					<p class="f4">From now on I will disavow the training and return to the lower life."</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he has returned to the lower life, be says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, reverend sirs, be satisfied!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br/>
