					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling in the Gabled Hall,<br/>
					in Mahavana, near Vesali.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hold it true, monks,<br/>
					that Ugga,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the householder of Vesali,<br/>
					is possessed of eight wonderful and marvellous qualities.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One, and thereafter,<br/>
					rising from his seat,<br/>
					the Well-farer entered the dwelling.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk,<br/>
					robing himself early in the morning,<br/>
					taking bowl and cloak,<br/>
					went to the house of Ugga, the householder,<br/>
					and there sat down on a seat made ready for him,<br/>
					And Ugga of Vesali approached that monk,<br/>
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said that monk to Ugga:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It has been declared by the Exalted One<br/>
					that you, O householder,<br/>
					are possessed of eight marvelous and wonderful qualities.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are those eight marvelous and wonderful qualities, householder,<br/>
					of which you are declared by the Exalted One to be possessed?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, reverend sir,<br/>
					I know not of what eight marvelous and wonderful qualities<br/>
					I am declared by the Exalted One to be possessed;<br/>
					but as to the eight marvelous and wonderful qualities found in me,<br/>
					listen, lend and ear and I will tell you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, householder,"<br/>
					replied the monk;<br/>
					and Ugga said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When I first saw the Exalted One,<br/>
					even a long way off,<br/>
					my heart, sir, at the mere sight of him<br/>
					became tranquil.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, with tranquil heart<br/>
					I drew nigh and reverenced the Exalted One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And to me he preached a graduated discourse,<br/>
					that is to say:<br/>
					on alms-giving,<br/>
					on virtue<br/>
					and on heaven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He set forth the peril,<br/>
					the folly,<br/>
					the depravity of lusts<br/>
					and the advantages of renunciation.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One knew<br/>
					that my heart was clear, malleable,<br/>
					free from hindrance,<br/>
					uplifted,<br/>
					lucid,<br/>
					then he revealed to me<br/>
					that Dhamma-teaching<br/>
					to which Buddhas alone have won,<br/>
					to wit:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ill,<br/>
					its coming-to-be,<br/>
					its ending<br/>
					and the Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a clean cloth,<br/>
					free of all stain,<br/>
					will take dye perfectly;<br/>
					even so, as I sat there,<br/>
					there arose within me<br/>
					the spotless, stainless Dhamma-sight:<br/>
					that whatsoever is conditioned by coming- <span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span> to-be,<br/>
					all that is subject to ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, saw Dhamma,<br/>
					possessed Dhamma,<br/>
					found Dhamma,<br/>
					penetrated Dhamma,<br/>
					overcame doubt,<br/>
					surpassed uncertainty,<br/>
					possessed without another's aid<br/>
					perfect confidence in the word of the Teacher,<br/>
					and there and then took refuge<br/>
					in the Buddha, in Dhamma and in the Order,<br/>
					and embraced<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> the five rules of training<br/>
					in the godly life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, sir, I had four wives,<br/>
					young girls,<br/>
					and I went and spoke to them thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Sisters, I have embraced the five rules of training in the godly life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Who wishes, may enjoy the wealth of this place,<br/>
					or may do deeds of merit,<br/>
					or may go to her own relations and family;<br/>
					or is there some man you desire<br/>
					to whom I may give you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And when I stopped speaking,<br/>
					the eldest wife said to me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Sir, give me to such and such a man!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I had that man sent for;<br/>
					and, taking my wife by the left hand<br/>
					and holding the water pot in my right,<br/>
					I cleansed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> that man (by an act of dedication).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yet I was not a whit discomfited<br/>
					at parting with my wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, sir, there is wealth in my family,<br/>
					but among the good and lovely in character<br/>
					it is shared impartially.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And when I wait upon a monk, sir,<br/>
					I serve him respectfully<br/>
					and not without deference.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If, sir, that reverend monk preach Dhamma to me,<br/>
					I listen attentively and not listlessly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he preach not Dhamma to me,<br/>
					I preach Dhamma to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, sir,<br/>
					it is not uncommon for devas to come<br/>
					and declare to me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Perfectly, O householder,<br/>
					is Dhamma pro- <span class="f2 g"><b>[145]</b></span> claimed by the Exalted One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">When they speak thus, I reply:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Ho! You devas,<br/>
					whether you declare so or not,<br/>
					Dhamma is perfectly proclaimed by the Exalted One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, sir, I feel no elation<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					because of such thoughts as:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It is to me these devas come.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am the man who talks to devas."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the seventh<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Of those five lower fetters,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> sir,<br/>
					declared by the Exalted One,<br/>
					I see no remnant whatsoever within me.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the eighth<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, sir, are the eight<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful qualities found in me;<br/>
					but I do not know of what eight<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful qualities<br/>
					I am declared by the Exalted One to be possessed."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that monk,<br/>
					after taking alms at Ugga's house,<br/>
					rose from his seat and departed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And when he had eaten his meal,<br/>
					after his alms-round,<br/>
					he went to the Exalted One<br/>
					and saluting him,<br/>
					sat down<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he told the Exalted One<br/>
					of all his conversation<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>
					with Ugga the householder of Vesali.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>(And the Exalted One said:)</i></p>

					<p class="f4">'Well done, well done, monk!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As Ugga, the householder of Vesali,<br/>
					in explaining the matter rightly<br/>
					should explain;<br/>
					even so, monk,<br/>
					he is declared by me<br/>
					to be possessed of those eight<br/>
					marvelous and wonderful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monk,<br/>
					hold it true<br/>
					that Ugga, the householder of Vesali,<br/>
					is so possessed!"</p>
