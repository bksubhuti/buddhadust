					<p><span class="f2">[218]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying in Ālavī, at Aggāḷava<br/>
					near the shrine there,<br/>
					Hatthaka, surrounded by some <span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span> five hundred lay-disciples,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					came and saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said to him, seated there:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This following of yours, Hatthaka,<br/>
					is very large.</p>

					<p class="f4">How do you manage to gather it together?"</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, it is by those four bases of gatherings,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					which have been declared by the Exalted One,<br/>
					that I gather this following together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, when I realize that this man may be enlisted by a gift<br/>
					I enlist him in this way;<br/>
					when by a kindly word,<br/>
					then in that way;<br/>
					when by a good turn,<br/>
					then so;<br/>
					or when I know that he must be treated as an equal,<br/>
					if he is to be enlisted,<br/>
					then I enlist him by equality of treatment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, lord, there is wealth in my family,<br/>
					and they know that such (treatment)<br/>
					is not rumoured<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> of a poor man."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done, well done, Hatthaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is just the way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> to gather together a large following.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever in the past gathered together a large following,<br/>
					did so on these four bases;<br/>
					likewise whosoever shall do so in the future;<br/>
					yea, whosoever now gathers a following together,<br/>
					gathers it on these four bases."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Hatthaka of Āḷavī, being instructed,<br/>
					stimulated,<br/>
					roused<br/>
					and gladdened by the Exalted One's Dhamma-discourse,<br/>
					rose from his seat,<br/>
					saluted him and departed,<br/>
					passing him by on his right.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of Hatthaka,<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hold it true, monks, that Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with eight marvellous and wonderful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, Hatthaka of Āḷavī has faith;<br/>
					Hatthaka of Āḷavī is virtuous;<br/>
					Hatthaka of Āḷavī is conscientious;<br/>
					Hatthaka of Āḷavī fears blame;<br/>
					Hatthaka of Āḷavī is a great listener;<br/>
					Hatthaka of Āḷavī is charitable;<br/>
					Hatthaka of Āḷavī is wise;<br/>
					Hatthaka of Āḷavī is modest."</p>
