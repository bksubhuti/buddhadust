					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt among the Sakyas in Banyan Tree Park, at Kapilavatthu.</p>

					<p class="f4">There Mahānamā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Sakyan, came and visited him and,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, addressing the Exalted One, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, how<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> becomes a man a lay-disciple?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Mahānamā, he has found refuge in the Buddha<br/>
					found refuge in Dhamma,<br/>
					found refuge in the Order,<br/>
					then he is a lay-disciple.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, how is a lay-disciple virtuous?</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, Mahānamā, a lay-disciple abstains from taking life;<br/>
					abstains from taking what is not given him;<br/>
					abstains from lustful and evil indulgences;<br/>
					abstains from lying;<br/>
					and abstains from spirituous intoxicants,<br/>
					the cause of indolence -<br/>
					then a lay-disciple is virtuous.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, how does a lay-disciple help on his own welfare,<br/>
					but not that of another?</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, Mahānamā, he has achieved faith for self,<br/>
					but strives not to compass faith in another;<br/>
					has achieved virtue for self,<br/>
					but strives not to compass virtue in another;<br/>
					has achieved himself renunciation,<br/>
					but strives not to compass renunciation in another;<br/>
					longs himself to see the monks,<br/>
					but strives not for this sight for another;<br/>
					longs himself to hear Saddhamma,<br/>
					but strives not for this hearing for another;<br/>
					is mindful himself of Dhamma he has heard,<br/>
					but strives not that another should be mindful of it;<br/>
					reflects himself upon the meaning of Dhamma he is mindful of,<br/>
					but strives not for another to reflect thereon;<br/>
					when he knows himself both the letter and the spirit of Dhamma<br/>
					and walks in comformity therewith,<br/>
					but strives not for another <span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span> so to walk -<br/>
					then a lay-disciple helps on his own welfare,<br/>
					but not that of another.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'And how, lord, does a lay-disciple help on<br/>
					both his own welfare and the welfare of another?</p>

					<p class="f4">'When indeed, Mahānamā, he has achieved faith for self,<br/>
					and strives to compass faith in another;<br/>
					has achieved virtue for self,<br/>
					and strives to compass virtue in another;<br/>
					has achieved himself renunciation,<br/>
					and strives to compass renunciation in another;<br/>
					longs himself to see the monks,<br/>
					and strives for this sight for another;<br/>
					longs himself to hear Saddhamma,<br/>
					and strives for this hearing for another;<br/>
					is mindful himself of Dhamma he has heard,<br/>
					and strives that another should be mindful of it;<br/>
					reflects himself upon the meaning of Dhamma he is mindful of,<br/>
					and strives for another to reflect thereon;<br/>
					when he knows himself both the letter and the spirit of Dhamma<br/>
					and walks in comformity therewith,<br/>
					and strives for another so to walk -<br/>
					then, Mahānamā, a lay-disciple helps on his own welfare and the welfare of another.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>
