					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Rājagaha in Jivaka's Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">There Jivaka Komarabhacca<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came and visited him and,<br/>
					after saluting, sat down at one side.<br/>
					There, addressing the Exalted One, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, how becomes a man a lay-disciple?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, Jivaka, he has found refuge in the Buddha<br/>
					found refuge in Dhamma,<br/>
					found refuge in the Order,<br/>
					then he is a lay-disciple.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, how is a lay-disciple virtuous?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, Jivaka, a lay-disciple abstains from taking life;<br/>
					abstains from taking what is not given him;<br/>
					abstains from lustful and evil indulgences;<br/>
					abstains from lying;<br/>
					and abstains from spirituous intoxicants,<br/>
					the cause of indolence<br/>
					— then a lay-disciple is virtuous.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, how does a lay-disciple<br/>
					help on his own welfare,<br/>
					but not that of another?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, Jivaka, he has achieved faith for self,<br/>
					but strives not to compass faith in another;<br/>
					has achieved virtue for self,<br/>
					but strives not to compass virtue in another;<br/>
					has achieved himself renunciation,<br/>
					but strives not to compass renunciation in another;<br/>
					longs himself to see the monks,<br/>
					but strives not for this sight for another;<br/>
					longs himself to hear Saddhamma,<br/>
					but strives not for this hearing for another;<br/>
					is mindful himself of Dhamma he has heard,<br/>
					but strives not that another should be mindful of it;<br/>
					reflects himself upon the meaning<br/>
					of Dhamma he is mindful of,<br/>
					but strives not for another<br/>
					to reflect thereon;<br/>
					when he knows himself both the letter and the spirit of Dhamma<br/>
					and walks in conformity therewith,<br/>
					but strives not for another so to walk<br/>
					— then a lay disciple helps on his own welfare,<br/>
					but not that of another.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'And how, lord, does a lay-disciple<br/>
					help on both his own welfare<br/>
					and the welfare of another?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, Jivaka, he has achieved faith for self,<br/>
