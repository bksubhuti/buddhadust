					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Bhaggis,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					on Crocodile Hill<br/>
					at the Deer Park in Bhesakaḷa Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Anuruddha was dwelling <span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span> among the Cetis<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					in the Eastern Bamboo Forest;<br/>
					and there these reflections occurred to him as he dwelt alone and secluded:</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one who wants little,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					this Dhamma is not for one who wants much.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for the contented,<br/>
					not for the discontented.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for the secluded,<br/>
					not for one fond of society.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for the energetic,<br/>
					not for the lazy.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one who has set up mindfulness,<br/>
					not for the laggard in mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for the composed,<br/>
					not for the flustered.</p>

					as easily as a strong man might stretch forth and bend back his arm,<br/>
					disappeared from the Deer Park of Bhesakaḷa Grove<br/>
					and appeared before him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One sat down on the seat which was made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Exalted One addressed him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well done! Well done, Anuruddha!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well have you pondered over the seven thoughts of a great man!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					not for the flustered.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for the wise,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But, Anuruddha, do you also ponder over this eighth thought of a great man, to wit:</p>
