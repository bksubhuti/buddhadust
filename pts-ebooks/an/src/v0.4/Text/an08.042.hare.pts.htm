					<p>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park at Jeta Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying: 'Monks.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord,' they replied,<br/>
					and the Exalted One spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the Observance day,<br/>
					when observed and kept with eight qualifications<br/>
