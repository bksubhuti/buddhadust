					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita Park.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Anuruddha had gone apart during the noon-day rest;<br/>

					a host of lovely fairies,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> who saluted and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus standing, they addressed the venerable one and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master Anuruddha, we are the fairies of lovely form.</p>

					<p class="f4">In three degrees we wield power and have dominion:</p>

					<p class="f4">We can assume in a trice<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> any colour we desire;<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">And those fairies,<br/>

					<p class="f4">At eventide, the venerable Anuruddha arose from solitude<br/>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Eight qualities have women, Anuruddha,<br/>
					who after death<br/>
					are reborn among the fairies of lovely form.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Anuruddha, the husband to whom her parents give her,<br/>
					out of love for her,<br/>
					seeking her good,<br/>
					in loving kindness<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span> and fond regard, -<br/>
					she will get up before him,<br/>
					retire after him,<br/>
					be obedient to his wishes,<br/>
					lovely in her ways<br/>
					and gentle in speech.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever is honoured by her husband as mother,<br/>
					father,<br/>
					recluse<br/>
					or godly man,<br/>
					such she reverences,<br/>
					honours,<br/>
					esteems<br/>
					and respects;<br/>
					on their arrival she proffers a seat and water.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever her husband's home industries,<br/>
					whether in wool or cotton,<br/>
					therein she is deft and nimble;<br/>
					gifted with an inquiring turn of mind<br/>
					into all such undertakings,<br/>
					she is able to arrange and carry them out.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Of whatever her husband's household consists -<br/>
					slaves,<br/>
					messengers<br/>
					or work-folk -<br/>
					she knows the work of each<br/>
					by what has been done;<br/>
					she knows their remissness<br/>
					by what has not been done;<br/>
					she knows the strength and the weakness of the sick;<br/>
					she divides the hard and soft food,<br/>
					each according to his share.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">When her husband brings home money,<br/>
					corn,<br/>
					silver<br/>
					or gold,<br/>
					she keeps it secure by watch and ward;<br/>
					and of it she is no robber,<br/>
					thief,<br/>
					carouser,<br/>
					wastrel.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">She is a lay-disciple,<br/>
					who has found refuge in the Buddha,<br/>
					in Dhamma<br/>
					and in the Order.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">She keeps the precepts,<br/>
					abstaining from taking life,<br/>
					from stealing,<br/>
					from fleshly lusts,<br/>
					from lying,<br/>
					from drinking strong drink,<br/>
					the cause of sloth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">She is charitable,<br/>
					dwelling at home with heart purged of the stain of stinginess;<br/>
					given over to charity,<br/>
					open-handed,<br/>
					taking delight in giving,<br/>
					yoke-mate to asking,<br/>
					she finds joy in alms-giving.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These, Anuruddha, are the eight qualities women have,<br/>
					who, after death, are reborn among the fairies of lovely form.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Active, alert to cherish him always,<br/>
							Not to that man who brings her every joy<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
							She offers slight, nor will a good wife move<br/>
							To wrath her husband by some spiteful word;<br/>
							And she reveres all whom her lord doth honour -<br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span> For she is wise. Deft, nimble, up betimes,<br/>
							She minds his wealth amid his folk at work<br/>
							And sweetly orders all. A wife like this,<br/>
							Who with her husband's wish and will complies,<br/>
							Is born again where lovely devas dwell.'</p>
