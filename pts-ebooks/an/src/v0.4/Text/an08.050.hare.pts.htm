					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in Eastern Park<br/>
					at the terraced house of Migāra's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Endowed with four qualities, Monks,<br/>
					womenfolk win power in this world;<br/>
					this world is in their grasp.</p>

					<p class="f4">With what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Monks, a woman is capable at her work;<br/>
					she manages the servants;<br/>
					in her ways she is lovely to her lord;<br/>
					she guards his wealth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Monks, is a woman capable at her work?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever her husband's home industries,<br/>
					whether in wool or cotton,<br/>
					therein she is deft and nimble;<br/>
					gifted with an inquiring turn of mind<br/>
					into all such undertakings,<br/>
					she is able to arrange and carry them out.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way a woman is capable at her work.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does she manage the servants?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever her husband's household consists of -<br/>
					slaves,<br/>
					messengers<br/>
					or work-folk -<br/>
					she knows the work of each<br/>
					by what has been done;<br/>
					she knows their remissness<br/>
					by what has not been done;<br/>
					she knows the strength and the weakness of the sick;<br/>
					she divides the hard and soft food,<br/>
					each according to his share.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way she manages the servants.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she lovely in her ways to her lord?</p>

					<p class="f4">What her lord reckons to be unlovely,<br/>
					that she would not commit<br/>
					for very life's sake.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus she is lovely in her ways to her lord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does she guard his wealth?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever money, corn, silver or gold<br/>
					her husband brings home,<br/>
					she keeps it secure by watch and ward;<br/>
					and of it she is no robber, thief, carouser or wastrel.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way she guards his wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with these four qualities, Monks,<br/>
					womenfolk win power in this world,<br/>
					this world is in their grasp.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with four qualities, Monks,<br/>
					womenfolk win power in the next world,<br/>
					the next world is in their grasp.</p>

					<p class="f4">With what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Monks, a woman is accomplished in faith,<br/>
					virtue,<br/>
					charity<br/>
					and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">She has faith and believes in the awakening of the Tathāgata, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of a truth he is the Exalted One, arahant, fully awake, abounding in wisdom and righteousness,<br/>
					the well-farer, world-knower,<br/>
					incomparable tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					teacher,<br/>
					the awakened of devas and men,<br/>
					the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her faith.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">She abstains from taking life,<br/>
					from stealing,<br/>
					from the lusts of the flesh,<br/>
					from lying<br/>
					and from drinking liquor,<br/>
					the cause of sloth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her virtue.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in charity?</p>

					<p class="f4">She dwells at home with heart purged of the stain of avarice,<br/>
					given over to charity,<br/>
					open-handed,<br/>
					delighting in giving,<br/>
					yoke-mate to asking,<br/>
					she finds joy in alms-giving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her charity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">She is wise<br/>
					and is endowed with wisdom<br/>
					into the way of the rise and fall of things,<br/>
					with Ariyan penetration of the way<br/>
					to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with these four qualities, Monks,<br/>
					womenfolk win power in the next world,<br/>
					the next world is in their grasp.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Deft, capable, she manages amid<br/>
							His folk at work, minding her husband's wealth,<br/>
							Sweet in her ways; and she is virtuous,<br/>
							Believing, kind and bountiful; she clears<br/>
							The onward Way to faring well hereafter.<br/>
							They say a woman who is so endowed,<br/>
							With these eight states, is virtuous indeed<br/>
							And truthful, just. And where these eight unite,<br/>
							Blessed sixteenfold, that virtuous devotee<br/>
							Is born again where lovely devas dwell.'</p>
