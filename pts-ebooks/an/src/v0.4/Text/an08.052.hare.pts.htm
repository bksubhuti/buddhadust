					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, while the Exalted One was staying at the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana near Vesālī,<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda came to him<br/>
					and saluted<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he spoke thus <span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span> to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, how many qualities must a monk have<br/>
					to be considered the spiritual adviser<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of nuns?</p>

					<p class="f4">'A monk, Ānanda, must have eight qualities<br/>
					to be considered the spiritual adviser of nuns.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, a monk is virtuous<br/>
					and lives restrained<br/>
					by the restraint of the Obligations;<br/>
					he is perfect in conduct and habit,<br/>
					seeing danger in the smallest fault;<br/>
					he undertakes and trains himself in the precepts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is learned<br/>
					with memory retentive<br/>
					and well stored.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Those tenets,<br/>
					lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle<br/>
					and lively in the end,<br/>
					which set forth in spirit<br/>
					and in letter<br/>
					the godly life of purity,<br/>
					perfect in its entirety -<br/>
					even those are fully mastered by him,<br/>
					resolved upon,<br/>
					familiarized by speech,<br/>
					pondered over in mind,<br/>
					fully understood in theory<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">To him both Obligations have been properly and fully handed down,<br/>
					sectioned,<br/>
					regulated<br/>
					and resolved into sutta<br/>
					and into detail.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He has a pleasant voice,<br/>
					his enunciation is good,<br/>
					his speech is urbane,<br/>
					distinct,<br/>
					free from hoarseness<br/>
					and informative.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is able to instruct,<br/>
					incite,<br/>
					rouse<br/>
					and gladden the Order of the nuns<br/>
					with religious discourse.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Generally, he is dear to<br/>
					and liked by the nuns.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Previous to his taking this Exalted One<br/>
					as his authority for going forth,<br/>
					for donning the yellow robe,<br/>
					he has been guilty of no serious crime.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He has been ordained twenty years or more.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk, Ānanda, must have these eight qualities<br/>
					to be considered a spiritual adviser of nuns.'</p>
