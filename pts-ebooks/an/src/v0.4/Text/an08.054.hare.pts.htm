					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling among the Koḷiyans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					at their market-town called Kakkarapatta.</p>

					<p class="f4">There Long-knee, the Koḷiyan clansman, visited the Exalted One and,<br/>
					after greeting him,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, we householders are immersed in the round of pleasure;<br/>
					we are cumbered with bed-mate and sons;<br/>
					we delight in the muslins from Benares<br/>
					and in sandalwood;<br/>
					we deck ourselves with flowers,<br/>
					with garlands and cosmetics;<br/>
					we enjoy the use of both silver and gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, to such as us,<br/>
					let the Exalted One also teach Dhamma;<br/>
					teach the things which will be to our advantage<br/>
					and for our happiness here on earth,<br/>
					for our advantage and happiness<br/>
					in the world to come!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">These four conditions, Tiger-foot,<br/>
					lead to a clansman's advantage and happiness here on earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span> Achievement in alertness,<br/>
					achievement in wariness,<br/>
					good company<br/>
					and the even life.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Tiger-foot, is achievement in alertness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, by whatsoever activity a clansman make his living,<br/>
					whether by the plough,<br/>
					by trading<br/>
					or by cattle-herding,<br/>
					by archery<br/>
					or as a rajah's man,<br/>
					or by any of the crafts<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					he is deft and tireless;<br/>

					into ways and means,<br/>
					he is able to arrange and carry out his job.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in alertness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Tiger-foot, is achievement in wariness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, whatsoever wealth a clansman get together by work and zeal,<br/>
					collect by the strength of his arm,<br/>
					earn by the sweat of his brow<br/>
					and justly obtain in a lawful manner<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					such he husbands by watch and ward, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now how can I arrange<br/>
					so that rajahs may not get this wealth out of me,<br/>
					nor thieves filch it,<br/>
					nor fire consume it,<br/>
					nor water carry it off,<br/>
					nor ill-disposed heirs make off with it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in wariness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Tiger-foot, is good company?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, in whatsoever village or market-town a clansman dwell,<br/>
					he consorts,<br/>
					converses,<br/>
					engages in talk<br/>
					with householders<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> or householders' sons,<br/>

					virtue,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He emulates the fullness of faith<br/>
					in such as are full of faith;<br/>
					he emulates the fullness of virtue<br/>
					in such as are full of virtue;<br/>
					he emulates the fullness of charity<br/>
					in such as are full of charity;<br/>
					he emulates the fullness of wisdom<br/>
					in such as are full of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called good company.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Tiger-foot, is the even life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman<br/>
					while experiencing both gain and loss in wealth,<br/>
					continues his <span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span> business serenely,<br/>
					not unduly elated or depressed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinks he:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus my income,<br/>
					after deducting the loss,<br/>
					will stand (at so much)<br/>
					and my outgoings will not exceed my income."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span>Just as one who carries scales,<br/>
					or his apprentice,<br/>
					knows, on holding up the balance,<br/>
					that either by so much it has dipped down<br/>
					or by so much it has tilted up;<br/>
					even so, Tiger-foot,<br/>
					a clansman experiencing both gain and loss<br/>
					continues his business serenely,<br/>
					neither unduly elated<br/>
					nor unduly depressed,<br/>
					but realizes that<br/>
					after allowing for the loss<br/>
					his income will stand at so much<br/>
					and that his outgoings will not exceed his income.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Tiger-foot, this clansman have but small earnings<br/>
					and live on a grand scale,<br/>
					it will be rumoured of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This clansman eats his wealth<br/>
					like a fig-tree glutton."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And if his earnings be great<br/>
					and he live meanly,<br/>
					rumour will say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This clansman will die like a starveling.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore this clansman while experiencing both gain and loss in wealth,<br/>
					continues his business serenely,<br/>
					not unduly elated or depressed,<br/>
					but realizes that<br/>
					after allowing for the loss<br/>
					his income will stand at so much<br/>
					and that his outgoings will not exceed his income.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the even life.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is achievement in faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman has faith and believes in the awakening of the Tathāgata, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in wisdom.</p>
