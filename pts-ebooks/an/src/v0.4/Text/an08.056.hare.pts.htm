					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, 'fear' is a term for the lusts;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					'ill' is a term for the lusts;<br/>
					'disease' is a term for the lusts;<br/>
					'blain' is a term for the lusts;<br/>
					'barb' is a term for the lusts;<br/>
					'bond' is a term for the lusts;<br/>
					'bog' is a term for the lusts;<br/>
					'womb' is a term for the lusts.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And wherefore, monks, is 'fear' a term for the lusts?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, since whosoever be bound by the passion of impulse,<br/>
					infatuated by the passion of lust,<br/>
					is neither free from fear in this world,<br/>
					nor free from fear in the world to come;<br/>
					therefore 'fear' is a term for the lusts.</p>
