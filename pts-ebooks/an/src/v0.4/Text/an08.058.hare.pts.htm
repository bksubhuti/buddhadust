					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Monks, a monk who is endowed with eight qualities<br/>
					is worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					the world's peerless field for merit.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Herein a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					he abides restrained by the restraint of the obligations,<br/>
					perfect in behaviour and conduct,<br/>
					seeing danger in the smallest fault,<br/>
					accepting the training,<br/>
					he trains himself accordantly;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">4. He is learned,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					<i>is replete with learning,<br/>
					is a hoard of learning.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Those doctrines which,<br/>
					lovely at the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely at the end<br/>
					both in the meaning and the letter of them,<br/>
					which preach the utterly fulfilled,<br/>
					the perfectly purified way of the God-life, -<br/>
					such doctrines are much heard by him,<br/>
					borne in mind,<br/>
					repeated aloud,<br/>
					pondered over<br/>
					and well penetrated by his vision;</i></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">5. He dwells strenuous,<br/>
					steadfast,<br/>
					energetic,<br/>
					shirking not the burden of righteousness;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">6. He is a forest-dweller,<br/>
					having his bed and seat apart from mankind;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">7. <span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>He endures likes and dislikes,<br/>
					dwelling in continuous mastery<br/>
					of dislikes which arise;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">8. He endures fear and dismay,<br/>
					dwelling in continuous mastery<br/>
					of fear and dismay which arise;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">9. He attains at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					to those pleasant states of living,<br/>
					even in this life,<br/>
					the four musings wholly mental;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">10. By destroying the cankers,<br/>
					he enters and abides in<br/>
					the emancipation of the heart and wisdom,<br/>
					which is cankerless,<br/>
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br/>
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a monk who is endowed with these eight qualities<br/>
					is worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					the world's peerless field for merit.'</p>
