					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Monks, there are these eight persons worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					the world's peerless field for merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Streamwinner,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he who attains to the realization of the fruit of Streamwinning,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">the Once-returner,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he who attains to the realization of the fruit of the Once-returner,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">the Non-returner,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he who attains to the realization of the fruit of the Non-returner,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">the Arahant,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and he who attains to to the realization of the fruit of Arahantship.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the eight persons worthy of offerings<br/>
					worthy of gifts,<br/>
					worthy of oblations,<br/>
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>
					the world's peerless field for merit."|| ||</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					      <p class="fp4 in2">Lo! Four there are who travel [on the Way],<br/>
							And there are four who in fruition stand:<br/>
							This the community of lofty worth,<br/>
							Eight persons these (pre-eminent) 'mong men.<br/>
							A gift to this community by men<br/>
							Bestowing alms, by mortals seeking good,<br/>
							Performing deeds of merit, which ensures<br/>
							Rebirth (as man), is very rich in fruit.'</p>

					<hr class="demi"/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare has for this: "the Arahant, and he who attains to Arahantship." In the Pali the wording is the same for all four.</p>
