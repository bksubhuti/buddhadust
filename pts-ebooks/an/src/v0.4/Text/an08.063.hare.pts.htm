					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain monk approached the Exalted One and greeted him and,<br/>
					after exchanging compliments of friendliness and courtesy,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he spoke to the Exalted One thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, well were it for me if the Exalted One would teach me Dhamma briefly.</p>

					<p class="f4">After hearing it I would abide alone, secluded, zealous, earnest, resolved.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, let the Exalted One teach me Dhamma briefly!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Well-farer teach me Dhamma briefly!</p>
