					<p>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying on Gaya Head at Gaya;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord,' they replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, before my awakening,<br/>
					while I was not yet completely awakened<br/>
					and but a being awakening,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, to me there came the thought:</p>

					and to see forms,<br/>
					knowledge and vision<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> within me<br/>
					would thus be better purified."</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, later on,<br/>
					living zealous,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					resolute,<br/>
					I both perceived the auras<br/>
					and saw the forms,<br/>
					but I did not stand with,<br/>
					talk to<br/>
					or engage in conversation<br/>
					any of those devas.</p>
