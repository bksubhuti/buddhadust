					<p>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these eight assemblies.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Assemblies of nobles,<br/>
					of brahmans,<br/>
					of householders,<br/>
					of recluses,<br/>
					of devas<br/>
					of the Four Royal devas,<br/>
