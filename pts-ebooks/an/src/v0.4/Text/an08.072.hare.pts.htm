					<p>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Monks, a monk has faith,<br/>
					but is not virtuous;<br/>
					so in that part he is not perfect.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then must that part be perfected.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oh that I might have both faith and virtue!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when a monk has both faith and virtue,<br/>
