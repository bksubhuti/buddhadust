					<p>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying in the Brick Hall at Nādika.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Mindfulness of death, monks,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					developed<br/>
					is very fruitful,<br/>
					of great advantage,<br/>
					merging and ending in the deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is mindfulness of death,<br/>
					when made become,<br/>
					developed<br/>
					very fruitful,<br/>
					of great advantage,<br/>
					merging and ending in the deathless?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a monk, who,<br/>
					when the day declines and night sets in,<br/>
					reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Many indeed are the chances<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of death for me.</p>

					<p class="f4">A snake or a scorpion or a centipede might bite me<br/>
					and might cause my death;<br/>
					that would be a hindrance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I might stumble and fall;<br/>
					the food I have eaten might make me ill;<br/>
					bile might convulse me;<br/>
					phlegm choke me;<br/>
					winds (within me) with their scissor-like cuts give me ague;<br/>

					<p class="f4">That would be a hindrance to me.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, that monk must reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Are there any evil and wrong states within me<br/>
					that have not been put away<br/>
					and that would be a hindrance to me<br/>
					were I to die tonight?'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, on consideration<br/>
					he realize that there are evil and wrong states within<br/>
					that have not been put away<br/>
					then to put away just those evil and wrong states<br/>
					an intense resolution,<br/>
