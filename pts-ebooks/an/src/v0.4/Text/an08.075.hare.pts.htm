					<p>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these eight achievements.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Achievement in alertness,<br/>
					in wariness,<br/>
					good company,<br/>
					an even life,<br/>
					achievement in faith,<br/>
					in virtue,<br/>
					in charity<br/>
					and in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the eight achievements.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Up and alert about his task and toil,<br/>
							A careful man, he minds his wealth and lives<br/>
							The even life; and he is virtuous,<br/>
							Believing, kind and bountiful; he clears<br/>
							The onward Way to faring well hereafter.<br/>
							Thus for the believing home-seeker eight states<br/>
							Have been declared by him whose name is Truth'<br/>
							As leading unto happiness both here and then,<br/>
							To bliss hereafter and to welfare now.<br/>
							This is the standard for a householder,<br/>
							For merit grows by generosity.'</p>
