					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> the whole sutta with <i>A.</i> v, 154, where ten terms are given. Puṇṇiya is again the inquirer, but both here and <i>ad</i> <i>A.</i> v, the <i>Comy.</i> is silent. I do not find mention of him elsewhere in the four Nikāyas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> We should possibly read: <i>'Yato ca kho, P., imehi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu hoti';</i> but the <i>S.e.</i> is the same as our text, and includes <i>aṭṭhahi</i> with most <i>MSS.</i> The <i>Comy.</i> seems to agree with the text, observing:	<i>Samannāgato-ti, sāmīatthe paccattaṃ, samannāgatassāti vuttaṃ hoti.</i></p>
