					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span></p>

					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One,<br/>
					while wandering for alms<br/>
					with a great company of monks<br/>
					among the Kosalese,<br/>
					came to the brāhman <span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span> village called Icchānaṅgala,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					belonging to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there he dwelt in Icchānaṅgala, Wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahman householders of Icchānaṅgala heard the news:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tis said Master Gotama, the Sakya,<br/>
					a wanderer from out the Sakyan clan,<br/>
					has arrived at Icchānaṅgala,<br/>
					and dwells in the Wood near by.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of that same Master Gotama,<br/>
					this good repute is noised abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is the Exalted One,<br/>
					arahant,<br/>
					the perfect Buddha,<br/>
					adept in knowledge and conduct,<br/>
					well going,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					incomparable<br/>
					a tamer of tamable men,<br/>
					among devas and men the teacher,<br/>
					Buddha,<br/>
					Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed it is to see such arahants!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">So at the end of that night,<br/>
					the brahman householders of Icchānaṅgala,<br/>
					taking with them much hard and soft food,<br/>
					went to Icchānaṅgala, Wood<br/>
					and waited outside the gateway,<br/>
					making there a great din and uproar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Nāgita<br/>
					was the personal attendant of the Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One called the venerable Nāgita<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who are these, Nāgita<br/>
					that make this great din and uproar?</p>

					<p class="f4">As fisher-folk, methinks,<br/>
					with a great haul of fish!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, these are the Icchānaṅgala, brahman householders,<br/>
					who wait outside the gateway.</p>

					<p class="f4">They have brought much hard and soft food<br/>
					for the use of the Exalted One<br/>
					and the monks of the Order."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have naught to do with homage, Nāgita,<br/>
					nor has homage aught to do with me.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					this happiness of renunciation,<br/>
					this happiness of seclusion,<br/>
					this happiness of calm,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[225]</b></span> this happiness of awakening,<br/>
					which I can obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty;<br/>
					let him enjoy that midden<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> of happiness,<br/>
					that dung-like happiness,<br/>
					that happiness gotten of gains,<br/>
					favours<br/>
					and flattery."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, let the Exalted One accept (their offering);<br/>
					let the Well-farer accept;<br/>
					now, lord, is the time for the Blessed One to accept!</p>

					<p class="f4">For wheresoever the Exalted One shall now go,<br/>
					the brahman householders<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					of town and country<br/>
					will be just like inclined (to give).</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, just as when the sky-deva rains big drops,<br/>
					the water flows with the slope (of the ground);<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					even so, lord, wheresoever the Exalted One shall now go,<br/>
					the brahman householders of town and country<br/>
					will be bent on (making offerings).</p>

					<p class="f4">And why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, lord, because of the virtue,<br/>
					wisdom<br/>
					and knowledge<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> of the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have naught to do with homage, Nāgita,<br/>
					nor has homage imght to do with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					this happiness of renunciation,<br/>
					this happiness of seclusion,<br/>
					this happiness of calm,<br/>
					this happiness of awakening,<br/>
					which I can obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty;<br/>
					let him enjoy that midden of happiness,<br/>
					that dung-like happiness,<br/>
					that happiness gotten of gains,<br/>
					favours<br/>
					and flattery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some devas, Nāgita,<br/>
					cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					this happiness of renunciation,<br/>
					this happiness of seclusion,<br/>
					this happiness of calm,<br/>
					this happiness of awakening,<br/>
					which I can obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nāgita, when you are assembled and met together<br/>
					and live enjoying company,<br/>
					I think thus:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, these worthies cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					this happiness of renunciation,<br/>
					this happiness of seclusion,<br/>
					this happiness of calm,<br/>
					this happiness of awakening,<br/>
					which I can obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty;<br/>
					so these worthies meet and come together<br/>
					and live enjoying company.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or else I see monks joking<br/>
					and making merry by poking<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> one another with their fingers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, these worthies cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					this happiness of renunciation <span class="f2 g"><b>[226]</b></span>,<br/>
					this happiness of seclusion,<br/>
					this happiness of calm,<br/>
					this happiness of awakening,<br/>
					which I can obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty;<br/>
					since they joke and make merry<br/>
					by poking one another with their fingers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or else I see monks,<br/>
					after eating as much as their bellies will hold,<br/>
					giving themselves over to the delight of bed,<br/>
					to the delight of languor<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>
					and to the delight of torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, these worthies cannot obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty<br/>
					this happiness of renunciation,<br/>
					this happiness of seclusion,<br/>
					this happiness of calm,<br/>
					this happiness of awakening,<br/>
					which I can obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty;<br/>
					so they cram their bellies to the uttermost<br/>
					and give themselves over to the delight of bed,<br/>
					languor<br/>
					and torpor.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or I see a monk living on the outskirts of some village,<br/>
					seated and composed,<br/>
					and I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Some park-servant or novice will presently disturb<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> this reverend sir<br/>
					and will oust him from that concentration.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I am not pleased, Nāgita,<br/>
					with that monk's abode,<br/>
					lying on the outskirts of a village.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I see a forest-dwelling monk,<br/>
					seated nodding<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> in a forest,<br/>
					and then I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Presently, when this reverend sir has got rid of this sleepiness,<br/>
					this lethargy,<br/>
					he will surely ponder on loneliness,<br/>
					making the forest his mark.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So I am pleased, Nāgita,<br/>
					by that monk's forest abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or I see a forest-dwelling monk,<br/>
					seated uncomposed in a forest,<br/>
					and I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Presently, this reverend sir<br/>
					will compose his uncomposed mind,<br/>
					or will preserve a composed state of mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I am pleased, Nāgita,<br/>
					with that monk's forest abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or I see, Nāgita,<br/>
					a forest-dwelling monk,<br/>
					seated composed in a forest,<br/>
					and I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Presently, this reverend sir<br/>
					will free the unfreed mind,<br/>
					or will preserve a state of mind,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[227]</b></span> which is free.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I am pleased, Nāgita,<br/>
					with that monk's forest abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">What time, Nāgita,<br/>
					I reach the high road<br/>
					and see no one either in front or behind me,<br/>
					I have leisure<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> even for calls of nature.'</p>
