					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the Order, should it wish,<br/>
					may turn down<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the bowl of a lay-disciple,<br/>
					who is possessed of eight qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes about to bring loss to the monks;<br/>
					he goes about to harm them;<br/>
					he goes about to evict them from their dwellings;<br/>
					he reviles and defames them;<br/>
					he causes disunion between monk and monk;<br/>
					he speaks in dispraise of the Buddha;<br/>
					he speaks in dispraise of Dhamma;<br/>
					he speaks in dispraise of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the Order, should it wish,<br/>
					may turn down the bowl of a lay-disciple,<br/>
					who is possessed of these eight qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Order, should it wish,<br/>
					may restore<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the bowl of a lay-disciple,<br/>
					who is possessed of of eight qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not go about to bring loss to the monks;<br/>
					he does not go about to harm them;<br/>
