					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the Order, should it wish,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He goes about to bring loss to householders;<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Paṭisāraṇīya-kammaṃ;</i> this is the name of the punishment of a monk, who has offended a layman; see, <i>Child. s.v.</i>, <i>Vin.</i> ii, 19; <i>G.S.</i> i, 84.</p>
