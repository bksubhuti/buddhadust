					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at the terraced house of Migāra's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">There Visākhā, the mother of Migāra, visited him and saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Exalted One addressed her and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Visākhā, the Observance day,<br/>
					when observed and kept with eight qualifications<br/>
					is very fruitful,<br/>
					of great advantage,<br/>
					very splendid,<br/>
					very thrilling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Visākhā, how is it so observed and kept?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Visākhā, an Ariyan disciple reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All their lives<br/>
					arahants abandon taking life<br/>
					and abstain therefrom;<br/>
					they dwell meekly and kindly,<br/>
					compassionately and mercifully to all beings,<br/>
					laying aside stick and sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br/>
					will abandon taking life and abstain therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will dwell meekly and kindly,<br/>
					compassionately and mercifully to all beings<br/>
					and lay aside both stick and sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, in this way,<br/>
					I shall follow the example of arahants<br/>
					and keep the Observance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With this first qualification is it kept.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'All their lives<br/>
					arahants abandon taking what is not given<br/>
					and abstain therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">They dwell taking what is given,<br/>
					expectant;<br/>
					not stealing,<br/>
					but holding themselves in purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br/>
					will abandon taking what is not given<br/>

					<p class="f4">I will dwell taking what is given,<br/>
					expectant;<br/>
					not stealing,<br/>
					but holding myself in purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, thereby, I shall follow the example of arahants<br/>
					and keep the Observance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With this second qualification is it kept.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'All their lives<br/>
					arahants abstain from living the ungodly life;<br/>
					living the godly life,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So, thereby, I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With this third qualification is it kept.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'All their lives<br/>
					arahants abandon lying and abstain therefrom;<br/>
					speaking the truth,<br/>
					bondsmen to truth,<br/>
					trustworthy,<br/>

					they deceive no one in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So, thereby, I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With this fourth qualification is it kept.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'All their lives<br/>
					arahants abandon spirituous liquors that cause sloth,<br/>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So, thereby, I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With this fifth qualification is it kept.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'All their lives<br/>
					arahants have but one meal (a day),<br/>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br/>

					<p class="f4">With this sixth qualification is it kept.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'All their lives<br/>
					arahants abstain from looking on at shows and fairs,<br/>
					where there is dancing,<br/>
					singing and music;<br/>
					from wearing,<br/>
					decorating or adorning themselves<br/>
					with garlands, scents and cosmetics.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now during this night and day,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'All their lives<br/>
					arahants abandon using large and lofty beds<br/>

					<p class="f4">So, in this way, I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With this eighth qualification is it kept.</p>

					<p class="f4">Visākhā, the Observance day,<br/>
					when observed and kept with these eight qualifications<br/>
					is very fruitful,<br/>
					of great advantage,<br/>
					very splendid,<br/>
					very thrilling."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"How fruitful,<br/>
					how advantageous,<br/>
					how splendid<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Visākhā, though one hold power,<br/>

					that is to say:</p>

					Gandharas<br/>
					and the Kambojas,<br/>
					yet such power is not worth a sixteenth part<br/>
					of the Observance day<br/>
					kept with the eight qualifications.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Mean, Visākhā, is the rule of man compared with celestial happiness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">The lifespan of those devas<br/>
