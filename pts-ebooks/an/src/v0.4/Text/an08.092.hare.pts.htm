					<p class="f4">"Monks, for the complete understanding of passion, eight states must be made become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">When, personally conscious of body,<br/>
					anyone sees forms exterior to himself,<br/>
					whether limited,<br/>

					he is thus conscious:</p>

					I know,<br/>
					I see them."</p>
