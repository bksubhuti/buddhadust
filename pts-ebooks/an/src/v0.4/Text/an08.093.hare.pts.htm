					<p>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, for the complete understanding of passion, eight states must be made become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Conscious of body, he sees forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Personally unconscious of body,<br/>
					he sees forms exterior to himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">He applies himself to the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is fair.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond all perception of form,<br/>
					by the disappearance of the perception of the sensory reactions,<br/>
					unattentive to the perception of the manifold,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space,<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Space is infinite.'</p>

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Consciousness is infinite.'</p>

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness,<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is nothing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the ending of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, for the complete understanding of passion, these eight states must be made become."</p>
