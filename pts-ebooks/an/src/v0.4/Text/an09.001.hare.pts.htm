					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying: "Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, monks, wanderers of other views should question you thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For conditions that wing to the awakening,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					what, reverend sirs, is the thing<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to make become?'</p>

					<p class="f4">How would you, thus questioned, reply to those wanderers?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, our ideas have their foundation in the Exalted One;<br/>
					they are guided by the Exalted One<br/>
					and are protected by him!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it for us,<br/>
					if the Exalted One were to make clear the essence of this matter;<br/>
					then, on hearing it,<br/>
					the monks would bear it in mind!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore, monks, listen, pay heed, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, monks, wanderers of other views should question you thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For conditions that wing to the awakening,<br/>
					what, <span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span> reverend sirs, is the thing to make become?'</p>

					<p class="f4">- you should, so questioned, reply to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein, reverend sirs, a monk has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, sirs, a monk is virtuous and dwells restrained by the restraint of the Obligations;<br/>
					he is perfect in behaviour and habitude,<br/>
					seeing danger in the smallest fault;<br/>
					undertaking the training,<br/>
					he trains himself accordantly.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, sirs, that talk which is serious and a help to opening the heart -<br/>
					that is to say,<br/>
					talk on wanting little,<br/>
					on contentment,<br/>
					on loneliness,<br/>
					on going apart,<br/>
					on strenuous endeavour,<br/>
					on virtue,<br/>
					on concentration,<br/>
					on wisdom,<br/>
					on emancipation,<br/>
					on the knowledge and vision of emancipation<br/>
					- a monk obtains at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, sirs, a monk dwells strenuous in purpose,<br/>
					putting away unrighteous conditions,<br/>
					taking to righteousness;<br/>
					persevering and energetic,<br/>
					he shirks not the burden of righteousness.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Moreover, sirs, a monk has wisdom<br/>
					and is endowed therewith<br/>
					as to the way of growth and decay,<br/>
					with Ariyan penetration<br/>
					concerning the way to the utter destruction of ill.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Sambodha-pakkhika,</i> I have not been able to trace this compound elsewhere. The context clearly shows that it is not the same as <i>bodhi-pakkhiyā dhammā</i> (see above, p. 151); the <i>Comy</i>, observes <i>catumagga-sankhātassa sambodhassa pakkhe bhavānaṃ upakārakdnaṃ.</i> At <i>Ud.</i> 36 <i>f.,</i> where the nine recur, the first five are <i>aparipakkāya cetovimuttiyā pañca dhammā paripākāya saṅvattanti. Ud.A.</i> 220 <i>ff.</i> has full comments. On <i>-pakkh-</i> ('side, flank, wing') <i>cf.</i> the stock sentence - <i>e.g.,</i> <i>D.</i> i, 71: 'as a bird carries as he flies just his wings with him.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> above, p. 221.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> gives the following parable: It is like a man, who sets about cutting rice with a sickle at one end of a paddy field. Cattle, breaking down his fence, push their way in; so he puts down his sickle and seizes a stick and drives them out by the same way, repairs the fence and finishes his cutting. The field is the Buddha's message; the harvester is the striver; the sickle is insight; the cutting time is reflection time; the stick is reflection on foul things; the fence is restraint; the cattle breaking in is the rising of passion; their ejection and his return to work is the destruction of passion and his return to reflection.</p>
