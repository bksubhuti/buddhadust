					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk visited the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, they say: 'Fully reliant,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> full reliant!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray how far, lord, is a monk fully reliant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If by<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> faith a monk put away evil and made good become,<br/>
					just by him is that evil put away.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If by conscientiousness a monk put away evil and made good become,<br/>
					just by him is that evil put away.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[234]</b></span> If by fear of blame a monk put away evil and made good become,<br/>
					just by him is that evil put away.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If by energy a monk put away evil and made good become,<br/>
					just by him is that evil put away.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If by wisdom a monk put away evil and made good become,<br/>
					just by him is that evil put away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, then is evil put away<br/>
					and well put away by that monk,<br/>
					when<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> it is seen with Ariyan wisdom and put away by him.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, monk, be is established in these five states,<br/>
					there are four (other) states,<br/>
					which a monk ought to rely on.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk deliberately follows the thing<br/>
					(which ought to be followed);<br/>
					deliberately attends to the thing<br/>
					(which ought to be attended to);<br/>
					deliberately avoids the thing<br/>
					(which ought to be avoided);<br/>
					deliberately expels the thing<br/>
					(which ought to be expelled).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, in such-wise is a monk fully reliant."</p>
