					<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">The Venerable Meghiya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h3>

					

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[234]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the venerable Meghiya was his attendant,<br/>
					the Exalted One<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> stayed at Calika,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> on the hill there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Meghiya approached the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So standing, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I would like to visit Jantugāma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> for alms."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do now, Meghiya, as you think timely."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Meghiya,<br/>
					dressing himself before noon,<br/>
					taking bowl and robe,<br/>
					entered Jantugāma for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had wandered about for alms<br/>
					and returned therefrom<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[235]</b></span> and finished his meal,<br/>
					he came to the bank of the Kimikaḷa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, while stretching his legs<br/>
					and roaming to and fro<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> along the river bank,<br/>
					the venerable Meghiya saw a mango grove,<br/>
					pleasing and beautiful;<br/>
					and at the sight, he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truly, this mango grove is pleasing and beautiful;<br/>
					meet, indeed, is it to strive here,<br/>
					for a clansman wanting to strive!</p>

					<p class="f4">If the Exalted One permit me,<br/>
					I will come and strive in this mango grove."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Meghiya returned to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side<br/>
					and (told him all that had taken place, adding):</p>

					<p class="f4">"If the Exalted One permit me,<br/>
					I will go to that mango grove and strive."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Stay awhile, Meghiya,<br/>
					till some other monk appear,<br/>
					for we are alone."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time the venerable Meghiya spoke, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, for the Exalted One there is nothing further to be done;<br/>
					there is no adding to his accomplishments.</p>

					<p class="f4">But for me, lord, there is more to be done;<br/>
					to what is done,<br/>
					there is (more) to be added.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If the Exalted One permit me,<br/>
					I will go to that mango grove and strive."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stay awhile, Meghiya,<br/>
					till some other monk appear,<br/>
					for we are alone."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time the venerable Meghiya spoke, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, for the Exalted One there is nothing further to be done;<br/>
					there is no adding to his accomplishments.</p>

					<p class="f4">But for me, lord, there is more to be done;<br/>
					to what is done<br/>
					there is more to be added.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the Exalted One permit me,<br/>
					I will go to the mango grove and strive."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[236]</b></span> 'What can we say to you, Meghiya,<br/>
					when you repeat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would strive'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do now, Meghiya, as you think fit."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Meghiya rose from sitting,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and keeping him on his right,<br/>
					went to the mango grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having come,<br/>
					he entered the grove and sat down at the foot of a tree<br/>
					to spend the noon-day rest.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And there, in that mango grove,<br/>
					three wicked, evil thoughts<br/>
					kept coming to the venerable Meghiya -<br/>
					that is to say,<br/>
					sensual thoughts,<br/>
					malign thoughts<br/>
					and cruel thoughts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Meghiya wondered thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is amazing and astonishing, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">By<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> faith alone<br/>
					have I gone forth from home<br/>
					to this homeless state;<br/>
					yet I am still dogged<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> by these three wicked, evil thoughts:<br/>
					sensual thoughts,<br/>
					malign thoughts,<br/>
					cruel thoughts."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Meghiya returned to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So standing, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, while I stayed in that mango grove,<br/>
					three wicked, evil thoughts kept coming to me:<br/>
					sensual thoughts,<br/>
					malign thoughts<br/>
					and cruel thoughts;<br/>
					and I thought how amazing and astonishing it was<br/>
					that I had gone forth<br/>
					from the home to the homeless life by faith alone;<br/>
					for, lord, I am still dogged by those three wicked, evil thoughts:<br/>
					sensual thoughts,<br/>
					malign thoughts,<br/>
					cruel thoughts."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"For the emancipation of the mind of the unripe,<br/>
					five conditions, Meghiya,<br/>
					are conducive to the ripening.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Meghiya, a monk has a good friend,<br/>
					a good companion,<br/>
					a good comrade.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the emancipation of the mind of the unripe,<br/>
					this is the first condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, a monk is virtuous<br/>
					and dwells restrained by the restraint of the Obligations<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span>
					he is perfect in behaviour and habitude,<br/>
					seeing danger in the smallest fault;<br/>
					undertaking the training,<br/>
					he trains himself accordantly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span> Then, Meghiya, that talk which is serious and a help to opening the heart -<br/>
					that is to say,<br/>
					talk on wanting little,<br/>
					on contentment,<br/>
					on loneliness,<br/>
					on going apart,<br/>
					on strenuous endeavour,<br/>
					on virtue,<br/>
					on concentration,<br/>
					on wisdom,<br/>
					on emancipation,<br/>
					on the knowledge and vision of emancipation<br/>
					- a monk obtains at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Meghiya, a monk dwells strenuous in purpose,<br/>
					putting away unrighteous conditions,<br/>
					taking to righteousness;<br/>
					persevering and energetic,<br/>
					he shirks not the burden of righteousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Meghiya, a monk has wisdom<br/>
					and is endowed therewith<br/>
					as to the way of growth and decay,<br/>
					with Ariyan penetration<br/>
					concerning the way to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Meghiya, is the fifth condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Meghiya, this may be expected of a monk,<br/>
					who has a good friend,<br/>
					companion, comrade:<br/>
					he will be virtuous,<br/>
					and dwell restrained by the restraint of the Obligations;<br/>
					perfect in behaviour and habitude,<br/>
					seeing danger in the smallest fault;<br/>
					undertaking the training,<br/>
					training himself accordantly.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">This may also be expected of a monk,<br/>
					who has a good friend,<br/>
					companion, comrade:<br/>
					that talk which is serious and a help to opening the heart -<br/>
					that is to say,<br/>
					talk on wanting little,<br/>
					on contentment,<br/>
					on loneliness,<br/>
					on going apart,<br/>
					on strenuous endeavour,<br/>
					on virtue,<br/>
					on concentration,<br/>
					on wisdom,<br/>
					on emancipation,<br/>
					on the knowledge and vision of emancipation<br/>
					- he will obtain at will,<br/>
					easily and without difficulty.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover this may also be expected of a monk,<br/>
					who has a good friend,<br/>
					companion, comrade:<br/>
					he will dwell strenuous in purpose,<br/>
					putting away unrighteous conditions,<br/>
					taking to righteousness;<br/>
					persevering and energetic,<br/>
					and will not shirk the burden of righteousness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And this may also be expected of a monk,<br/>
					who has a good friend,<br/>
					companion, comrade:<br/>
					he will have wisdom<br/>
					and be endowed therewith<br/>
					as to the way of growth and decay,<br/>
					with Ariyan penetration<br/>
					concerning the way to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Meghiya, when that monk is established in those five conditions,<br/>
					four more conditions must be made to become,<br/>
					that is to say,<br/>
					(reflection on) foul things<br/>
					must be made to become,<br/>
					to put away passion;<br/>
					(reflection on) amity<br/>
					must be made to become,<br/>
					to put away ill-will;<br/>
					mindfulness in in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					must be made to become,<br/>
					to cut off distraction; the thought of impermanence<br/>
					must be made to become,<br/>
					to uproot the conceit 'I am.'</p>

						

					<p class="f4">For a monk, Meghiya, who thinks on impermanence,<br/>
					the thought of not-self endures;<br/>
					thinking on there being no self,<br/>
					he wins to the state wherein the conceit "I am" has been uprooted,<br/>
					to the cool,<br/>
					even in this life."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>
