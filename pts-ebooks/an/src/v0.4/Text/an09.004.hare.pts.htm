					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying near <i>Sāvatthī</i>,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/>
					the venerable Nandaka<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> gave Dhamma discourse to the monks in the service hall;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					taught them,<br/>
					roused them,<br/>
					incited them<br/>
					and gladdened them.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in the evening<br/>
					the Exalted One rose from seclusion<br/>
					and approached the service hall;<br/>
					and having come,<br/>
					he stood outside the doorway,<br/>
					waiting for the discourse to end.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he knew that the discourse was ended,<br/>
					he coughed and tapped on the bolt.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[238]</b></span> Then those monks opened the door to the Exalted One,<br/>
					and he entered the hall and sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had seated himself,<br/>
					the Exalted One spoke thus to the venerable Nandaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely, Nandaka, this Dhamma discourse,<br/>
					which you preached to the monks,<br/>
					was a long one!</p>

					<p class="f4">My back ached as I stood outside the doorway, waiting for the discourse to end."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken,<br/>
					the venerable Nandaka, being embarrassed,<br/>
					said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, lord, we knew not that the Exalted One stood outside the door.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had we known, lord, we would not have said so much."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One knew<br/>
					that the venerable Nandaka was embarrassed,<br/>
					so he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done, well done, Nandaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is right for you clansmen,<br/>
					who by faith have gone forth from the home to the homeless life,<br/>
					when you may be seated around for Dhamma discourse!</p>

					<p class="f4">For you assembled, Nandaka, there are two courses:<br/>
					either discourse on Dhamma<br/>
					or maintain the Ariyan silence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

						

					<p class="f4">A monk, Nandaka, has faith,<br/>
					but is not virtuous;<br/>
					so in that part he is not perfect.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore that part must be perfected.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Would that I might have both faith and virtue."</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, Nandaka, the monk has both faith and virtue,<br/>
					then is he in that part perfect.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk, Nandaka, has faith and virtue,<br/>

					<p class="f4">A monk, Nandaka, has faith and virtue<br/>
					and can obtain calm of mind within,<br/>

					insight into things;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					so in that part he is not perfect.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as some four-footed creature<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> may have one foot short<br/>
					and <span class="f2 g"><b>[239]</b></span> stunted and so be not perfect in that limb;<br/>
					even so, Nandaka, a monk has faith and virtue<br/>
					and can obtain calm of mind within,<br/>
					but cannot obtain by more-wisdom insight into things;<br/>
					so in that part he is not perfect.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore that part must be perfected.</p>

					can obtain calm of mind within<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One;<br/>
					and when the Well-farer had finished speaking,<br/>
					he rose from his seat and entered his abode.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the Exalted One had gone,<br/>

					which is perfect and pure in its entirety,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now there are, reverend sirs,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case, reverend sirs, of a monk,<br/>

					just so often is the Teacher dear to him,<br/>
					loved,<br/>
					esteemed<br/>

					in the word <span class="f2 g"><b>[240]</b></span> and in the meaning of this Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, reverend sirs, is the second advantage<br/>

					its profound import.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>
