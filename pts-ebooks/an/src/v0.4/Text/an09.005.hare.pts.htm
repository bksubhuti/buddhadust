					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was dwelling near <i>Sāvatthī</i>,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four powers.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of wisdom,<br/>
					of energy,<br/>
					of faultlessness<br/>
					and of sympathy.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the power of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Such conditions as are bad and reckoned so;<br/>
					such as are good and reckoned so;<br/>
					such as are blameworthy and reckoned so;<br/>
					such as are faultless and reckoned so;<br/>
					such as are dark<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> and reckoned so;<br/>
					such as are bright and reckoned so;<br/>
					such as are not to be sought after and reckoned so;<br/>
					such as are to be sought after and reckoned so;<br/>
					such are as not truly Ariyan and reckoned so;<br/>
					such as are truly Ariyan and reckoned so -<br/>
					all these things are clearly seen and by wisdom well examined.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the power of energy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Such conditions as are bad and reckoned so;<br/>
					such as are blameworthy,<br/>
					dark,<br/>
					not to be sought after,<br/>
					not truly Ariyan,<br/>
					and reckoned so -<br/>
					to rid himself of such<br/>
					he puts forth his whole desire,<br/>
					exerts himself,<br/>
					makes strenuous endeavour,<br/>
					bends his mind and so resolves.</p>

					<p class="f4">But such as are good and reckoned so;<br/>
					are faultless,<br/>
					bright,<br/>
					to be sought after,<br/>
					are Ariyan and reckoned so -<br/>
					to gain all those he puts forth his whole desire,<br/>
					exerts himself,<br/>
					makes strenuous endeavour,<br/>
					bends his mind,<br/>
					and so resolves.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of energy.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the power of faultlessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, an Ariyan disciple is faultless in act of body,<br/>
					is faultless in act of speech,<br/>
					is faultless in act of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of faultlessness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the power of sympathy?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these four bases of sympathy:<br/>
					gifts,<br/>
					kindness,<br/>
					doing good<br/>
					and equal treatment.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, that is the best gift:<br/>
					the gift of Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, that is the best kindness:<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[242]</b></span> teaching Dhamma again and again<br/>
					to the good and attentive listener.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, that is the best of good deeds:<br/>
					inciting, instilling, establishing the ways<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> of faith<br/>
					in an unbeliever;<br/>
					inciting, instilling, establishing the ways of virtue<br/>
					in the immoral;<br/>
					inciting, instilling, establishing the ways of generosity<br/>
					in the mean;<br/>
					inciting, instilling, establishing the ways of wisdom<br/>
					in the foolish.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, that is the best equality:<br/>
					that which exists between Streamwinner and Streamwinner,<br/>
					between Once-returner and Once-returner,<br/>
					between Non-returner and Non-returner,<br/>
					between Arahant and Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of sympathy.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four powers.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					who is endowed with these four powers,<br/>
					has passed by five fears.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The fear of (wrong) livelihood,<br/>
					of ill-fame,<br/>
					of embarrassment in assemblies,<br/>
					of death,<br/>
					of a miserable afterlife.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, that Ariyan disciple reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I fear not the fear of livelihood.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Why should I fear the fear of livelihood?</p>

					<p class="f4">Have I not four powers:<br/>
					the power of wisdom,<br/>
					energy,<br/>
					faultlessness<br/>
					and sympathy?</p>

					<p class="f4">But the foolish may fear that fear;<br/>
					the indolent may fear that fear;<br/>
					the faulty in act of deed, word or thought may fear that fear;<br/>
					the unsympathetic may fear that fear.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor do I fear the fear of ill-fame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should I fear the fear of ill-fame?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, possessed of those four powers,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple has passed by these five fears.'</p>
