					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, on Mount Vulture Peak, Sajjha, the wanderer, came and paid him a visit.</p>

					<p class="f4">After greeting the Exalted One and exchanging the usual complimentary speeches,<br/>
					he sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he addressed the Exalted One thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now on one occasion, lord, when the Exalted One was staying here at Rājagaha, on Giribbaja,<br/>
					I heard this from the mouth of the Exalted One,<br/>
					from his own mouth I learnt it:</p>

					<p class="f4">The arahant monk, Sajjha<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span>,<br/>
					who has destroyed the cankers,<br/>
					lived the life,<br/>
					done what was to be done,<br/>
					laid down the burden,<br/>
					won to the goal,<br/>
					burst the bonds of becoming<br/>
					and is freed by the fullness of gnosis,<br/>
					cannot transgress the five standards:</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk, in whom the cankers are destroyed,<br/>
					cannot deliberately take the life of any living thing:<br/>
					cannot, with intention to steal,<br/>
					take what is not given;<br/>
					cannot indulge in carnal intercourse;<br/>
					cannot intentionally tell a lie;<br/>
					cannot enjoy pleasures from savings,<br/>
					as of yore when a householder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Prithee, lord, have I heard the matter rightly from the Exalted One;<br/>
					have I grasped it rightly;<br/>
					have I borne it in mind rightly;<br/>
					have I understood it rightly?</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Certainly, Sajjha,<br/>
					you have heard the matter rightly;<br/>
					grasped it rightly;<br/>
					borne it in mind rightly<br/>
					and understood it rightly!</p>

					<p class="f4">Both in the past and now,<br/>
					I, verily, declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">The arahant monk, who has destroyed the cankers,<br/>
					lived the life,<br/>
					done what was to be done,<br/>
					laid down the burden,<br/>
					won to the goal,<br/>
					burst the bonds of becoming<br/>
					and is freed by the fullness of gnosis,<br/>
					cannot transgress nine standards:</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk, in whom the cankers are destroyed,<br/>
					cannot deliberately take the life of any living thing;<br/>
					cannot, with intention to steal,<br/>
					take what is not given;<br/>
					cannot indulge in carnal intercourse;<br/>
					cannot intentionally tell a lie;<br/>
					cannot enjoy pleasures from savings,<br/>
					as of yore when a householder;<br/>
					a monk, in whom the cankers are destroyed,<br/>
					cannot go astray through desire;<br/>
					cannot go astray through hate;<br/>
					cannot go astray through delusion;<br/>
					cannot go astray through fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both in the past and now, Sajjha, I verily declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">An arahant monk, who has lived the life,<br/>
					done what was to be done,<br/>
					laid down the burden,<br/>
					won to the goal,<br/>
					burst the bonds of becoming<br/>
					and is freed by the fullness of gnosis,<br/>
					cannot transgress these nine standards.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> The text has this repetition addressed to Sajjha, but it is more likely this was delivered to Sutavan (see AN 9.7) and overheard by Sajjha.</p>
