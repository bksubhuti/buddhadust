					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta came and visited him,<br/>
					saluted and sat down at one,side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the venerable Sāriputta said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I have spent the rainy season here in Savatthī,<br/>
					and I now wish to go into the country."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time, Sāriputta, to do as you think fit."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Sāriputta got up,<br/>
					saluted<br/>
					and took his departure,<br/>
					keeping the Exalted One on his right.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after his departure a certain monk addressed the Exalted One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the venerable Sāriputta has offended<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> me,<br/>
					and without asking my pardon<br/>
					has set out on a journey."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>
					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said to a monk:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go thou, monk, and in my name bid Sāriputta come, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Teacher calls you, Sāriputta.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied the monk,<br/>
					and (he went and gave the venerable Sāriputta the Exalted One's message).</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, reverend sir," he replied.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then went the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna and the venerable Ānanda, with their keys,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> from lodging to lodging, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Haste ye, reverend sirs, and come,<br/>
					for the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					will now roar his lion's roar<br/>
					in the presence of the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Sāriputta went to the Exalted One and<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[249]</b></span> saluted him and sat down at one side;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is here, Sāriputta,<br/>
					a fellow wayfarer,<br/>
					who has a grievance.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He says:</p>

They say that on leaving the Exalted One, the skirt of Sāriputta's robe brushed the elder - they say the wind blew it aside - and it was on such a paltry ground that he trumped up a deliberate offence. <i>cf.</i> <i>Dhp.A.</i> ii, 178 <i>ff.,</i> where the story recurs.</p>
