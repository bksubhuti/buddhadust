					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anathapiṇḍika's Park,<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta before noon dressed<br/>
					and, with bowl and robe,<br/>
					went towards Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> thought he:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Too early is it yet<br/>
					to go about for alms in Sāvatthi.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to go and visit the park<br/>
					of the 'Wanderers of other views.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So the venerable Sāriputta went to their park and,<br/>
					after exchanging with them the usual compliments,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>
					this happened to be the topic of their talk,<br/>
					as they sat gathered around:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'All who die with some attached remainder<br/>
					are not altogether freed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> from hell,<br/>
					rebirth in the womb of an animal,<br/>
					the realm of ghosts,<br/>
					nor from the untoward way,<br/>
					the ill way,<br/>
					the abyss,<br/>
					hell.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Sāriputta neither applauded,<br/>
					nor disparaged their speech,<br/>
					but without comment<br/>
					rose from his seat and departed,<br/>
					saying to himself,<br/>
					"I will learn the truth of the matter<br/>
					from the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					after going about for alms in Sāvatthi,<br/>
					when he had returned therefrom<br/>
					and eaten his meal,<br/>
					visited the Exalted One and,<br/>
					after saluting,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>
