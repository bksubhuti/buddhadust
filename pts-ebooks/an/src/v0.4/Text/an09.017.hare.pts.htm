					nor is it meet to sit down among them,<br/>
					if one has visited them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What nine?</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not rise up pleasantly;<br/>
					nor greet one pleasantly;<br/>
					nor offer one a seat pleasantly;<br/>
					if they have one, they hide it;<br/>
					from plenty they give little;<br/>
					though they have choice food, they give coarse food;<br/>
					they give without respect or care;<br/>
					they do not sit round to hear Dhamma;<br/>
					they savour<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> not the spoken word.</p>
