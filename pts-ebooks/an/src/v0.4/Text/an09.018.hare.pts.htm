					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At Savatthī the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the Observance day,<br/>
					when kept and held with nine qualifications,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					is very fruitful,<br/>
					of great advantage,<br/>
					very splendid,<br/>
					very thrilling.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is the Observance day,<br/>
					when kept and held with nine qualifications,<br/>
					very fruitful,<br/>
					of great advantage,<br/>
					very splendid,<br/>
					very thrilling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, monks, the Ariyan disciple who reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"All their lives arahants give up taking of life<br/>
					and abstain therefrom;<br/>
					they dwell meekly and kindly,<br/>
					compassionately and mercifully to all beings,<br/>
					laying aside stick and sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br/>
					will give up taking life and abstain therefrom;<br/>
					I will dwell meekly and kindly,<br/>
					compassionately and mercifully to all beings,<br/>
					and lay aside both stick and sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, in this way,<br/>
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">"All their lives arahants abstain from taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="f4">They dwell taking what is given,<br/>
					expectant;<br/>
					not stealing but holding themselves in purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br/>
					will abstain from taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, thereby,<br/>
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this second qualification is it observed.</p>

					speaking the truth,<br/>
					bondsmen to the truth,<br/>
					trustworthy,<br/>
					dependable,<br/>
					they deceive no one in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br/>

					likewise the second,<br/>
					third<br/>
					and fourth quarter.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And so the whole world,<br/>

					far-reaching,<br/>
					abounding,<br/>
					measureless,<br/>
					free from hatred and ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, in this way,<br/>
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this ninth qualification is it observed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when the Observance day is kept and held with these nine qualifications,<br/>
