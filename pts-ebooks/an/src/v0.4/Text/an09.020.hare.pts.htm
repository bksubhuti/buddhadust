					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was dwelling near <i>Sāvatthī</i>,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/>
					the householder, Anāthapiṇḍika, visited him<br/>
					and after saluting sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One addressed Anāthapiṇḍika thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is alms given in your family,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> householder?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord, alms are given, but it consists of a coarse mess of broken rice grains together with sour gruel."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Long ago, householder, there lived a brahman called Velama.</p>

					<p class="f4">He gave very rich gifts, such as these:</p>

					<p class="f4">He gave eighty-four thousand golden bowls,<br/>
					filled with silver;<br/>
					he gave eighty-four thousand silver bowls,<br/>
					filled with gold;<br/>
					he gave eighty-four thousand copper bowls,<br/>
					filled with treasure;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>
					he gave eighty-four thousand steeds,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
					with trappings of gold,<br/>
					with banners of gold,<br/>
					covered with nets of gold thread;<br/>
					he gave eighty-four thousand chariots,<br/>
					spread with lion-skins,<br/>
					tiger-skins,<br/>
					leopard-skins,<br/>
					saffron-coloured blankets,<br/>
					with golden trappings,<br/>
					golden banners,<br/>
					covered with nets of gold thread;<br/>
					he gave eighty-four thousand milch kine,<br/>
					with tethers of fine jute,<br/>
					with milk-pails of silver;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					he gave eighty-four thousand maidens<br/>
					adorned with jewelled ear-rings;<br/>
					he gave eighty-four thousand <span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span> couches,<br/>
					spread with fleecy covers,<br/>
					white blankets and woollen flower-embroidered coverlets,<br/>
					covered with rugs of antelope skins,<br/>
					with awnings above<br/>
					and crimson cushions at each end<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>
					he gave eighty-four thousand lengths<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> of cloth,<br/>
					of finest flax,<br/>
					of finest silk,<br/>
					of finest wool,<br/>
					of finest cotton.</p>

					<p class="f4">And who shall tell of the food and the drink that he gave,<br/>
					food both hard and soft,<br/>
					sweetmeats and syrups!</p>

					<p class="f4">They flowed, methinks, as rivers!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps, householder, you may think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Maybe Velama, the brahman,<br/>
					who made that very rich gift,<br/>
					was someone else.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But think not so,<br/>
					for it was I,<br/>
					who at that time was Velama, the brahman;<br/>
					it was I who made that very rich gift.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But when that alms was given, householder,<br/>
					there was no one worthy to receive the gift;<br/>
					there was none to sanctify that gift.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">For, though brahman Velama gave that very rich gift,<br/>
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>
					had he fed one person of right view.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>
					or though he fed a hundred persons of right view,<br/>
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>
					had he fed one Once-returner.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>
					or though he fed a hundred Arahants,<br/>
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>
					or though he fed a hundred silent Buddhas,<br/>
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>
					had he fed one Tathāgata, arahant, fully awake.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>
					or though he fed the Order of monks,<br/>
					with the Buddha at their head,<br/>
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>
					had <span class="f2 g"><b>[265]</b></span> he built a monastery<br/>
					for the use of the monks<br/>
					of the Order of the surrounding country.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>
					or though with pious heart<br/>
					he took refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and the Order,<br/>
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>
					had he with pious heart<br/>
					undertaken to keep the precepts:<br/>
					abstention from taking life,<br/>
					from taking what is not given,<br/>
					from carnal lusts,<br/>
					from lying<br/>
					and from intoxicating liquor,<br/>
					the cause of sloth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>
					or though with pious heart<br/>
					he undertook to keep these precepts,<br/>
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>
					had he made become a mere passing fragrance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span> of amity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>
					or though he made become just the fragrance of amity,<br/>
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>
					had he made become,<br/>
					just for a finger-snap,<br/>
					the thought of impermanence.'</p>
