					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying: "Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these nine spheres of beings.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What nine?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are beings differing in body<br/>
					and differing in perceptive power,<br/>
					as for instance mankind,<br/>
					some devas<br/>
					and some in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first sphere of beings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are beings differing in body<br/>
					and similar in perceptive power,<br/>
					as for instance devas of the Brahma world,<br/>
					reborn there after practising the first (musing here).</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second sphere of beings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are beings similar in body,<br/>
					but differing in perceptive power,<br/>
					as for instance the radiant devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third sphere of beings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are beings similar in body<br/>
					and similar in perceptive power,<br/>
					as for instance the lustrous devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth sphere of beings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are beings without perceptive power<br/>
					and without feeling,<br/>
					as for instance the unconscious devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth sphere of beings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are beings who,<br/>
					by wholly transcending the perception of form,<br/>
					by the passing away of the perception of the sense-reaction<br/>
					and by turning the attention away from the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>
					attain to the sphere of infinite space, realizing:<br/>
					Space is infinite.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth sphere of beings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are beings who,<br/>
					by having wholly transcended the sphere of infinite space,<br/>
					attain to the sphere of infinite consciousness, realizing:<br/>
					Consciousness is infinite.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the seventh sphere of beings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are beings who,<br/>
					having wholly transcended the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					attain to the sphere of nothingness, realizing:<br/>
					There is nothing.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the eighth sphere of beings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are beings who,<br/>
					having wholly transcended the sphere of nothingness,<br/>
					attain to the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ninth sphere of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the nine spheres of beings."</p>
