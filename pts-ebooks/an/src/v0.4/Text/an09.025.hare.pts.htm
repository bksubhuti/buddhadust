					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying: "Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, when the mind of a monk is well heaped around with wisdom,<br/>
					it is proper for that monk to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know that birth is destroyed,<br/>
					the godly life lived,<br/>
					done is what was to be done<br/>
					and there is no more life in these conditions.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is the mind of a monk<br/>
					well heaped around with wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Passion-free is my mind' -<br/>
					(knowing this) is his mind well heaped around with wisdom;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					(knowing this) is his mind well heaped around with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, when the mind of a monk<br/>
