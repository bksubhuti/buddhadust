					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once when the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable Candikāputta<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> were dwelling near Rājagaha<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrel's Feeding Ground,<br/>
					the venerable Candikāputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, Devadatta taught Dhamma to the monks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, sirs, the mind of a monk<br/>

					it is proper for that monk to explain:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I know that birth is destroyed,<br/>
					the godly life lived,<br/>
					done is what was to be done<br/>
					and there is no more life in these conditions."'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when he had thus spoken,<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, reverend Candikāputta,<br/>
					Devadatta<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> taught not Dhamma so:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, sirs, the mind of a monk<br/>

					done is what was to be done<br/>
					and there is no more life in these conditions."'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">but he taught the monks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, sirs, the mind of a monk<br/>
					is <b>well heaped</b> around with thoughtfulness,<br/>
					it is proper for that monk to explain:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I know that birth is destroyed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">A second time<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> the venerable Candikāputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, Devadatta taught Dhamma to the monks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when he had thus spoken,<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta said:</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, reverend sirs, is the mind of a monk<br/>
					well heaped around with thoughtfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">His mind is well heaped around with thoughtfulness<br/>
					as to being passion-free,<br/>
					hatred-free,<br/>
					delusion-free,<br/>
					free of any passionate condition,<br/>
					hateful condition,<br/>
					delusive condition,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If touches cognizable by the body<br/>

					<p class="f4">If ideas, cognizable by the senses,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">1</a></sup></span> reverend sirs,<br/>
					a stone column sixteen cubits<span class="f3"><sup>8</sup></span> long and one<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> half of it,<br/>
