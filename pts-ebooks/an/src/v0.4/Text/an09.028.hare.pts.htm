					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br/>
					there the Exalted One said this to the Monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, monks, for the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					the fivefold dread and hatred has ceased,<br/>
					and he is endowed with the four possessions of the Streamwinner,<br/>
					he may, should he wish,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What fivefold dread and hatred has ceased?</p>

					<p class="f4">When, monks, the taker of life,<br/>
					by reason of his taking life,<br/>
					breeds dread and hatred in this world,<br/>
					or when he breeds dread and hatred in the next world,<br/>
					he experiences in the mind<br/>

					but he who abstains from taking life<br/>
					breeds no dread and hatred in this world,<br/>
					breeds no dread and hatred in the next world,<br/>
					nor experiences in the mind<br/>
					pain and grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that dread and hatred has ceased for him,<br/>

					<p class="f4">When, monks,<br/>
					the liar<br/>
					by reason of his lying,<br/>
					breeds dread and hatred in this world,<br/>
