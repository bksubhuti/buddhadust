					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br/>
					there the Exalted One addressed the Monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord" they replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these nine gradual abidings.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What nine?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk,<br/>
					aloof from sense desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil ideas,<br/>
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>
					which is born of solitude<br/>
					and is full of zest and ease.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>
					which is self-evolved,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					full of zest and ease,<br/>
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br/>
					mindful and self-possessed,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>
					and experiences in his being<br/>
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br/>
					and is free of ease and ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br/>
					by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br/>
					unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br/>
					'Space is infinite'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br/>
					'Consciousness is infinite'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br/>
					'There is nothing'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[277]</b></span> Passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the ending of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the nine gradual abidings.'</p>
