					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Lord" they replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you these nine attainments of gradual abidings;<br/>
					listen,<br/>
					pay heed,<br/>
					I will speak."</p>
