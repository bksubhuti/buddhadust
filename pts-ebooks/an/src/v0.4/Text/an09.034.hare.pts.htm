					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[279]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta dwelt near Rājagaha at the Squirrels' Feeding Ground in the Bamboo Grove;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This cool, reverend sirs, is happiness;<br/>
					this cool, reverend sirs, is happiness."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when he had thus spoken,<br/>
					the venerable Udāyin<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> said to him:</p>

						

					<p class="f4">"But what herein, reverend sir, is the happiness<br/>
					which herein is not sensed?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[280]</b></span> "It is, verily, just that happiness which herein is not sensed.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, reverend sir,<br/>
					these five strands of sense desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are forms, cognized by the eye,<br/>
					longed for,<br/>
					alluring,<br/>
					pleasurable,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					bound up with passion and desire.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There are sounds cognized by the ear,<br/>
					longed for,<br/>
					alluring,<br/>
					pleasurable,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					bound up with passion and desire.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There are smells cognized by the nose,<br/>
					longed for,<br/>
					alluring,<br/>
					pleasurable,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					bound up with passion and desire.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There are tastes cognized by the tongue,<br/>
					longed for,<br/>
					alluring,<br/>
					pleasurable,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					bound up with passion and desire.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There are contacts, cognized by the touch,<br/>
					longed for,<br/>
					alluring,<br/>
					pleasurable,<br/>
					lovely,<br/>
					bound up with passion and desire.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">These, reverend sir, are the five strands of sense desire;<br/>
					and the happiness,<br/>
					the well-being arising therefrom<br/>
					is called sensuous happiness.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, reverend sir, the monk who,<br/>
					aloof from sense desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil ideas,<br/>
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>
					which is born of solitude<br/>
					and is full of zest and ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br/>
					perceptions and thoughts<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> accompanied by sense desire beset him,<br/>
					it is indeed for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, sir, as some ill,<br/>
					amounting to a disease,<br/>
					might arise in a happy person;<br/>
					even so those perceptions and thoughts accompanied by sense desire beset him;<br/>
					and indeed it is for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now disease is called ill by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, reverend sir, it is just in this way that the cool ought to be understood as happiness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br/>
					suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>
					which is self-evolved,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					full of zest and ease,<br/>
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br/>
					perceptions and thoughts accompanied by applied and sustained thought beset him,<br/>
					it is indeed for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, sir, as some ill,<br/>
					amounting to a disease,<br/>
					might arise in a happy person;<br/>
					even so those perceptions and thoughts accompanied by applied and sustained thought beset him;<br/>
					and indeed it is for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now disease is called ill by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, reverend sir, it is just in this way that the cool ought to be understood as happiness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br/>
					free from the fervour of zest,<br/>
					mindful and self-possessed,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>
					and experiences in his being<br/>
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br/>
					perceptions and thoughts accompanied by the fervour of zest beset him,<br/>
					it is indeed for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, sir, as some ill,<br/>
					amounting to a disease,<br/>
					might arise in a happy person;<br/>
					even so those perceptions and thoughts accompanied by the fervour of zest beset him;<br/>
					and indeed it is for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now disease is called ill by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, reverend sir, it is just in this way that the cool ought to be understood as happiness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br/>
					by putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br/>
					and is free of ease and ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br/>
					perceptions and thoughts accompanied by poise beset him,<br/>
					it is indeed for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, sir, as some ill,<br/>
					amounting to a disease,<br/>
					might arise in a happy person;<br/>
					even so those perceptions and thoughts accompanied by poise beset him;<br/>
					and indeed it is for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now disease is called ill by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, reverend sir, it is just in this way that the cool ought to be understood as happiness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br/>
					by passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br/>
					by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br/>
					unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br/>
					'Space is infinite.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br/>
					perceptions and thoughts accompanied by form beset him,<br/>
					it is indeed for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, sir, as some ill,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br/>
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br/>
					'Consciousness is infinite.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br/>
					perceptions and thoughts accompanied by the sphere of infinite space beset him,<br/>
					it is indeed for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, sir, as some ill,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br/>
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br/>
					'There is nothing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br/>

					it is indeed for him a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, sir, as some ill,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br/>
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br/>
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br/>
