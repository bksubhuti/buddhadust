							<p class="in2">Verily, monks, it is said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, as far as perception prevails<br/>
					there is gnosis-penetration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, those spheres -<br/>
					both the attainment of the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception<br/>
					and the ending of perception and feeling -<br/>
					are ones which, I say,<br/>
					ought to be properly<span class="f3"><sup>9</sup></span> made known by musers,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
