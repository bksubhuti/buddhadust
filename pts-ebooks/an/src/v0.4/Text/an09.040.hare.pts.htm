					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[291]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One said this to the Monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, when bull or cow or young or baby elephant,<br/>
					browsing on the grass-tops,<br/>
					forestalls some forest tusker about to take his feed,<br/>
					so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed;<br/>
					when bull or cow or young or baby elephant<br/>
					devouring the bunches<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of broken boughs<br/>
					forestalls some forest tusker about to take his feed,<br/>
					so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed;<br/>
					when bull or cow or young or baby elephant,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span> stirring up the water with his trunk,<br/>
					forestalls the forest tusker,<br/>
					gone down to the water-hole<br/>
					so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed;<br/>
					when cow elephants go and rub against the body of the tusker, gone down to the water-hole,<br/>
					so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed:<br/>
					then, monks, the forest tusker thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I'faith, I live now in a crowd of bull elephants,<br/>
					cow elephants,<br/>
					young elephants,<br/>
					baby elephants;<br/>
					I eat merely grass-stubble;<br/>
					they eat my bunches of broken boughs;<br/>
					I drink muddied water;<br/>
					and cow elephants come and rub against my body<br/>
					when I've gone to the water-hole!</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I dwell alone,<br/>
					withdrawn from the herd?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And presently, monks, he dwells alone,<br/>
					withdrawn from the herd;<br/>
					and he eats uncropped grass,<br/>
					and none devours his bunches of boughs;<br/>
					he drinks unmuddied water,<br/>
					and cow elephants come not and rub against him in the water-hole.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And at that time he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the past I dwelt in a crowd of bull elephants,<br/>
					cow elephants,<br/>
					young elephants,<br/>
					baby elephants;<br/>
					I ate merely grass-stubble;<br/>
					they ate my bunches of broken boughs;<br/>
					I drank muddied water;<br/>
					and cow elephants came and rubbed against my body<br/>
					when I went to the water-hole;<br/>
					but now I dwell alone,<br/>
					withdrawn from the herd;<br/>
					and I eat uncropped grass,<br/>
					and none devours my bunches of boughs;<br/>
					and I drink unmuddied water,<br/>
					and cow elephants come not and rub against me in the water-hole.'</p>

					<p class="f4">and breaking off a bunch of boughs with his trunk,<br/>
					he rubs his body with it and joyfully allays the itch.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is just so, monks,<br/>
					when a monk lives in a crowd of monks, nuns, lay-disciples,<br/>
					both men and women,<br/>
					rajahs, their ministers,<br/>
					course-setters and their disciples;<br/>
					he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Truly I now live in a crowd of monks, nuns, lay-disciples,<br/>
					both men and women,<br/>
					rajahs, their ministers,<br/>
					course-setters and their disciples!</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to live alone,<br/>
					withdrawn from the horde?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And he resorts to some secluded dwelling:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> forest,<br/>
					tree-root,<br/>
					mountain,<br/>
					glen,<br/>
					cliff-cave,<br/>
					cemetery,<br/>
					wooded upland,<br/>
					open space<br/>
					or heap of straw -<br/>
					and come to forest,<br/>
					tree-root<br/>
					or empty hut,<br/>
					he sits crossed legged,<br/>
					holds his body erect<br/>
					and sets mindfulness before him.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And putting away worldly coveting,<br/>
					he abides with mind freed therefrom;<br/>
					he purges his mind of coveting:<br/>
					putting away ill-will and hatred,<br/>
					he abides with mind free therefrom;<br/>
					kindly, compassionate towards all creatures,<br/>
					he purges his mind of ill-will and hatred;<br/>
					putting away sloth and torpor,<br/>
					he abides freed therefrom;<br/>
					conscious,<br/>
					alert,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					mindful,<br/>
					self-possessed,<br/>
					he purges his mind of sloth and torpor:<br/>
					putting away flurry and worry,<br/>
					he abides unflurried;<br/>
					with mind inwardly calmed,<br/>
					he <span class="f2 g"><b>[293]</b></span> purges his mind of flurry and worry;<br/>
					putting away doubt,<br/>
					he abides with doubt passed by;<br/>
					no 'how? how?' questioner,<br/>
					he purges his mind of doubt as to right things.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And putting away these five hindrances,<br/>
					weakening the mind's corruptions<br/>
					by wisdom,<br/>
					aloof from sense desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil ideas,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>
					which is born of solitude<br/>
					and is full of zest and ease.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>
					which is self-evolved,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					full of zest and ease,<br/>
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br/>
					mindful and self-possessed,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>
					and experiences in his being<br/>
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br/>
					and is free of ease and ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br/>
					by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br/>
					unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br/>
					'Space is infinite'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br/>
					'Consciousness is infinite'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br/>
					'There is nothing'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the ending of perception and feeling<br/>
					and seeing by wisdom that the cankers are completely destroyed, he rejoices greatly at having allayed the irritant."</p>
