					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the venerable Ānanda was dwelling near Kosambī in Ghosita Park,<br/>
					the venerable Udāyin<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> visited him<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[296]</b></span> and, after exchanging the usual polite talk,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so seated, he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, reverend sir, was said by the deva,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Pañcālacaṇḍa:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'From noose escape he found, quick sage,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> who woke<br/>
							To musing - wakened, seer, adept, withdrawn.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what, sir, is the noose<br/>
					and what the way of escape<br/>
					declared by the Exalted One?"</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"These five stands of sense desire, reverend sir,<br/>
					are called the noose by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Forms cognized by the eye,<br/>
					longed for,<br/>
					alluring,<br/>
					pleasurable,<br/>

					bound up with passion and desire;</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, reverend sir, the monk who,<br/>
					aloof from sense desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil ideas,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>
					which is born of solitude<br/>
					and is full of zest and ease -<br/>
					thus far, reverend sir,<br/>
					and in one particular<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					did the Exalted One declare a way of escape from the noose.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But there, too, is a noose;<br/>

					<p class="f4">In so far as thought applied and sustained is not ended,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now consider, sir, the monk who<br/>
					suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>
					which is self-evolved,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					full of zest and ease,<br/>
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed -<br/>
					thus far, reverend sir,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br/>
					mindful and self-possessed,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>
					and experiences in his being<br/>
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br/>
					"He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease," -<br/>
					thus far, reverend sir,<br/>

					<p class="f4">By putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br/>

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br/>
					by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br/>
					unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>
