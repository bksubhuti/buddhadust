					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when the venerable Ānanda was dwelling near Kosambī in Ghosita Park, the venerable Udāyin visited him<br/>
					and, after exchanging the usual polite talk,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so seated, he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Tranquillity, tranquillity,' they say, sir;<br/>
					and as to what has tranquillity been declared by the Exalted One?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>
					aloof from sense desires,<br/>
					aloof from evil ideas,<br/>
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>
					which is born of solitude<br/>
					and is full of zest and ease<br/>
					and to the extent of that sphere<br/>
					abides with body attuned to it -<br/>
					and by wisdom understands it -<br/>
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>
					has tranquillity been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>
					which is self-evolved,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					full of zest and ease,<br/>
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed<br/>
					and to the extent of that sphere<br/>
					abides with body attuned to it -<br/>
					and by wisdom understands it -<br/>
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>
					has tranquillity been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>
					free from the fervour of zest,<br/>
					mindful and self-possessed,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>
					and experiences in his being<br/>
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br/>
					"He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease,"<br/>
					and to the extent of that sphere<br/>
					abides with body attuned to it -<br/>
					and by wisdom understands it -<br/>
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>
					has tranquillity been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>
					by putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br/>
					and is free of ease and ill<br/>
					and to the extent of that sphere<br/>
					abides with body attuned to it -<br/>
					and by wisdom understands it -<br/>
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>
					has tranquillity been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>
					by passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br/>
					by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br/>
					unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br/>
					'Space is infinite'<br/>
					and to the extent of that sphere<br/>
					abides with body attuned to it -<br/>
					and by wisdom understands it -<br/>
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>
					has tranquillity been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br/>
					'Consciousness is infinite'<br/>
					and to the extent of that sphere<br/>
					abides with body attuned to it -<br/>
					and by wisdom understands it -<br/>
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>
					has tranquillity been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br/>
					'There is nothing'<br/>
					and to the extent of that sphere<br/>
					abides with body attuned to it -<br/>
					and by wisdom understands it -<br/>
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>
					has tranquillity been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception<br/>
					and to the extent of that sphere<br/>
					abides with body attuned to it -<br/>
					and by wisdom understands it -<br/>
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>
					has tranquillity been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br/>
					he enters and abides in the ending of perception and feeling<br/>
					and seeing by wisdom that the cankers are completely destroyed<br/>
					and to the extent of that sphere<br/>
					abides with body attuned to it -<br/>
					and by wisdom understands his cankers are destroyed<br/>
					thus far, sir, and with no (further) particular<br/>
					has tranquillity been declared by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare notes at Sutta 43 that "suttas 43-61 are presumably conversations between Ānanda and Udayin." The Nidana has been inserted here following this understanding. Hare abbreviates everything past the introductory paragraph in each.</p>
