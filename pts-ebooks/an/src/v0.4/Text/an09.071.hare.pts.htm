					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five forms of mental barrenness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk has doubts and is perplexed about the Teacher,<br/>
					is not certain nor<br/>
					sure concerning him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso doubts and is perplexed about the Teacher,<br/>
					is not certain<br/>
					nor sure concerning him,<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>
					it is the first mental barrenness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk has doubts and is perplexed about	Dhamma,<br/>
					is not certain<br/>
					nor sure concerning the Dhamma,<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>
					it is the second mental barrenness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk has doubts and is perplexed about the Order,<br/>
					is not certain<br/>
					nor sure concerning the Order,<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>
					it is the third mental barrenness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk has doubts and is perplexed about the training,<br/>
					is not certain<br/>
					nor sure concerning the training,<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>
					it is the fourth mental barrenness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, when	he	is	angry with his fellows in the godly life,<br/>
					displeased with them,<br/>
					upset about them,<br/>
					is as a barren waste<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso is <span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span> angry with his fellows,<br/>
					displeased with them,<br/>
					upset about them<br/>
					and is as a barren waste for them,<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>
					it is the fifth mental barrenness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the five forms of mental barrenness.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

						
						
					<p class="f4">Monks, when these five are put away,<br/>
					four arisings of mindfulness should be made to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk abides contemplating the body as body,<br/>
					strenuous,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and self-possessed,<br/>
					having overcome both the hankering and discontent<br/>
					common in the world.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He abides contemplating the feelings as feelings<br/>
					strenuous,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and self-possessed,<br/>
					having overcome both the hankering and discontent<br/>
					common in the world.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He abides contemplating the mind as mind<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He abides contemplating ideas as ideas<br/>
					strenuous,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and self-possessed,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when these five are put away,<br/>
					these four arisings of mindfulness should be made to become.</p>
