					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five forms of mental bondage.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk as regards the lusts<br/>
					is not completely free of passion,<br/>
					nor of desire,<br/>
					nor of fondness,<br/>
					nor of thirst,<br/>
					nor of fever,<br/>
					nor of craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br/>
					nor of desire,<br/>
					nor of fondness,<br/>
					nor of thirst,<br/>
					nor of fever,<br/>
					nor of craving<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>
					it is the first mental bondage.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk as regards the body<br/>
					is not completely free of passion,<br/>
					nor of desire,<br/>
					nor of fondness,<br/>
					nor of thirst,<br/>
					nor of fever,<br/>
					nor of craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br/>
					nor of desire,<br/>
					nor of fondness,<br/>
					nor of thirst,<br/>
					nor of fever,<br/>
					nor of craving<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>
					it is the second mental bondage.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk as regards shapes<br/>
					is not completely free of passion,<br/>
					nor of desire,<br/>
					nor of fondness,<br/>
					nor of thirst,<br/>
					nor of fever,<br/>
					nor of craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br/>
					nor of desire,<br/>
					nor of fondness,<br/>
					nor of thirst,<br/>
					nor of fever,<br/>
					nor of craving<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>
					it is the third mental bondage.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk if,<br/>
					after eating as much as his belly can hold,<br/>
					he give himself over to the ease of bed,<br/>
					of (lying on his) back,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					of slumber<br/>
					is not completely free of passion,<br/>
					nor of desire,<br/>
					nor of fondness,<br/>
					nor of thirst,<br/>
					nor of fever,<br/>
					nor of craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br/>
					nor of desire,<br/>
					nor of fondness,<br/>
					nor of thirst,<br/>
					nor of fever,<br/>
					nor of craving<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>
					it is the fourth mental bondage.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk if he live the godly life<br/>
					set on gaining some celestial body,<br/>
					thinking by virtue,<br/>
					practice,<br/>
					austerity<br/>
					or chastity<br/>
					to become a deva,<br/>
					or one of the retinue of a deva,<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br/>
					nor of desire,<br/>
					nor of fondness,<br/>
					nor of thirst,<br/>
					nor of fever,<br/>
					nor of craving<br/>
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>
					devotion,<br/>
					perseverance,<br/>
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>
					it is the fifth mental bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the five forms of mental bondage.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

						
						
					<p class="f4">Monks, when these five are put away,<br/>
					four arisings of mindfulness should be made to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk abides contemplating the body as body,<br/>
					strenuous,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and self-possessed,<br/>
					having overcome both the hankering and discontent<br/>
