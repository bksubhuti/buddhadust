<hr/>

					<p><b>Editor's Note:</b> From here to the end should be regarded as one sutta. The wheel 'repetition series' on the understanding, etc. of passion, etc.
340 suttas grouped together. Seventeen concepts (passion, hatred, illusion, anger, enmity, hypocrisy, malice, envy, avarice, deceit, craftiness, obstinacy, impetuosity, pride, arrogance, intoxication and indolence) played off against 10 concepts (understanding, comprehension, exhaustion, abandonment, destruction, decay, freedom from desire, ending, quittance, and renunciation), played off against each of two sets of 9 concepts (1. the thought of foulness, of death, of the repulsiveness of food, of universal wretchedness, of impermanence, of ill in impermanence, of no self in ill, of renunciation, of freedom from passions; and 2. the first musing (jhāna), second musing, third musing, fourth musing, sphere of infinite space, sphere of infinite consciousness, sphere of nothingness, sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, and the ending of perception and feeling). The Pali has been left in it's abbreviated state as for most users this will actually be easier to compare with the English than if fully rolled out.
This is the first time these have been seen in English fully rolled out. A truly mind-stretching exercise! Thank goodness for copy and paste.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>
