					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.<br/>
					So seated he said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>
					what is the profit<br/>
					of good conduct?"<sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, Ānanda, freedom from remorse<sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup> is the object,<br/>
					freedom from remorse is the profit<br/>
					of good conduct."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span> "Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>
					what is the profit<br/>
					of freedom from remorse?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Joy, Ānanda, is the object,<br/>
					joy is the profit<br/>
					of freedom from remorse."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, sir, what is the object,<br/>
					what is the profit<br/>
					of joy?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rapture, Ānanda,<br/>
					is the object,<br/>
					rapture is the profit<br/>
					of joy."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"But pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>
					what is the profit<br/>
					of rapture?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Calm, Ānanda,<br/>
					is the object,<br/>
					calm is the profit<br/>
					of rapture."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, sir, what is the object,<br/>
					what is the profit<br/>
					of calm?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Happiness, Ānanda,<br/>
					is the object,<br/>
					happiness is the profit<br/>
					of calm."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[2]</span>"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>
					what is the profit<br/>
					of happiness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Concentration,<sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup> Ānanda,<br/>
					is the object,<br/>
					concentration is the profit<br/>
					of happiness."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"But pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>
					what is the profit<br/>
					of concentration?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Knowing and seeing things as they really are, Ānanda,<br/>
					is the object and profit<br/>
					of concentration."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the object, sir,<br/>
					what the profit<br/>
					of knowing and seeing things as they really are?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revulsion and fading of interest, Ānanda,<br/>
					is the object of it."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object and profit<br/>
					of revulsion and fading of interest?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Release by knowing and seeing, Ānanda,<br/>
					is the object and profit of these.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So you see, Ānanda,<br/>
					good conduct has freedom from remorse<br/>
					as object and profit;<br/>
					freedom from remorse has joy;<br/>
					joy has rapture;<br/>
					rapture has calm;<br/>
					calm has happiness;<br/>
					happiness has concentration;<br/>
					concentration has seeing things as they really are;<br/>
					seeing things as they really are has revulsion and fading interest;<br/>
					revulsion and fading of interest <span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span> has release by knowing and seeing as their object and profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">So you see, Ānanda, good conduct leads gradually up to the summit."<sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup><i>Kim-atthiyaṅ.</i> It is not easy to translate this, the adjective of <i>attha</i> (cf. <i>G.S.</i> iv, pp. vii, x, xix). The root-idea is 'thing-sought,' or '-needed,' and so 'aimed at.' This is well shown in the much-used parable of the man <i>sār-atthiko (-ika=iya),</i> 'seeking (or needing) timber': see below again, p. 201; also five times in the <i>Majjhima</i> and four times in <i>K.S.</i> The 'forward view' in the contexts makes such a term as 'of what use' not quite so suitable.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup><i>Sīlāni</i> (good conduct) is more literally habits, then, moral habits. The English words give too wide and deep a range.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Avippaṭisāro;</i> cf. <i>D.</i> i, 73; <i>S.</i> iv, 351; <i>A.</i> iii, 21 = <i>G.S.</i> iii, 16. In the Elevens the same set is made into eleven by taking revulsion-and-fading as two terms.</p>
