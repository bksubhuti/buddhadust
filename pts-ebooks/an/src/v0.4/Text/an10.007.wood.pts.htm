					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously, and after the exchange of greetings and reminiscent talk,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Ānanda said this to the Venerable Sāriputta: </p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray Sāriputta, your reverence, may it be<br/>
					that a monk's winning of concentration<br/>
					is of such a sort<br/>
					that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>
					in water unaware of water,<br/>
					in heat unaware of heat,<br/>
					in air unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>
					that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>
					in the world beyond unaware of it<br/>
					and yet at the same time does perceive?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[9]</span> "Yes Ānanda, your reverence, a monk's winning of concentration may be of such a sort<br/>
					that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>
					in water unaware of water,<br/>
					in heat unaware of heat,<br/>
					in air unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>
					that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>
					in the world beyond unaware of it<br/>
					and yet at the same time he may perceive."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Sāriputta, your reverence, in what way<br/>
					may that be?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once on a time, Ānanda, your reverence,<br/>
					I myself was staying near this same Sāvatthī in Dark Wood,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					and on that occasion I attained to concentration of such a sort<br/>
					that in earth I was unaware of earth,<br/>
					in water unaware of water,<br/>
					in heat unaware of heat,<br/>
					in air unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>
					that in this world I was unaware of this world,<br/>
					in the world beyond unaware of it<br/>
					and yet at the same time I did perceive."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray what did you perceive on that occasion, Sāriputta, your reverence?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"One perception arose in me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'To end becoming is nibbāna.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Another perception faded out in me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'To end becoming<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, your reverence,<br/>
					from a fire of splinters<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					one spark arises<br/>
					and another spark fades out,<br/>
					even so in me<br/>
					one perception arose:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'To end becoming is nibbāna',<br/>
					and another perception,<br/>
					that to end becoming is nibbāna,<br/>
					faded out in me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yet at the same time, your reverence,<br/>
					I consciously perceived."</p>
