					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Complete in five factors, monks,<br/>
					a monk who follows after and resorts to<br/>
					the lodging-place<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> which is complete in five factors<br/>
					in no long time,<br/>
					by destroying the cankers,<br/>
					realizes in this same visible existence<br/>
					the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					thoroughly comprehending it of himself,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					abides therein.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">How is a monk complete in five factors?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is a believer;<br/>
					he believes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He that Exalted <span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span> One, Arahant,<br/>
					is a perfectly Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Welfarer,<br/>
					a world-knower,<br/>
					trainer unsurpassed of men to be trained,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					Awakened One,<br/>
					Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover he is little troubled by sickness and disease;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he is furnished with digestive power<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					not too hot or too cold,<br/>
					but even<br/>
					and suitable for striving;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he is honest,<br/>
					no deceiver,<br/>
					he is one who shows himself as he really is<br/>
					to the Teacher,<br/>
					to his discerning co-mates in the brahma-life;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he dwells resolute in energy,<br/>
					ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br/>
					stout and strong to acquire good qualities,<br/>
					not shirking the burden in good qualities;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he is a man of insight,<br/>
					possessed of insight<br/>
					for tracing the rise and fall of things,<br/>
					insight that is Ariyan,<br/>
					penetrating,<br/>
					going on to the utter destruction of ill.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, monks,<br/>
					a monk is complete in five factors.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one's lodging-place complete in five factors?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a lodging-place<br/>
					is not too far<br/>
					and not too near (a village),<br/>
					but suitable for coming and going,<br/>
					by day not frequented,<br/>
					by night quiet and undisturbed by noise,<br/>
					not plagued with contact of flies,<br/>
					mosquitoes,<br/>
					wind,<br/>
					rain<br/>
					and creeping things.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, for one dwelling in such a lodging-place<br/>
					the supply of robes and alms-food,<br/>
					of bed and lodging,<br/>
					comforts in sickness<br/>
					and medicaments<br/>
					comes about with little trouble;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">further in that lodging-place<br/>
					dwell elder monks who have heard much,<br/>
					who are versed in the sayings,<br/>
					who know the teachings thoroughly,<br/>
					<span class="f2">[16]</span> who know the discipline and summaries by heart.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Consorting with them from time to time<br/>
					he inquires of them<br/>
					and questions them <span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span> thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is this, your reverence?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the meaning of this?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those worthies then open up to him<br/>
					what was sealed,<br/>
					make clear what was obscure,<br/>
					and on divers doubtful points of doctrine<br/>
					they resolve his doubts.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how one's lodging-place is complete in five factors.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, monks, complete in five factors,<br/>
					a monk who follows after<br/>
					and resorts to the lodging-place<br/>
					complete also in five factors<br/>
					in no long time,<br/>
					by destroying the cankers,<br/>
					realizes in this same visible existence<br/>
					the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					thoroughly comprehending it of himself,<br/>
					and having attained it abides therein."</p>
