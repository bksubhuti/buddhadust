					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Kurus at Kammasadhamma,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> a township of the Kurus.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these ten ways of Ariyan living,<br/>
					according to which Ariyans have lived,<br/>
					do live<br/>
					and shall live.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk has abandoned five factors,<br/>
					is possessed of six factors,<br/>
					guards one factor,<br/>
					observes the four bases,<br/>
					has shaken off individual belief,<br/>
					has utterly given up longings,<br/>
					his thoughts are unclouded,<br/>
					his body-complex is tranquillized,<br/>
					he is well released in heart,<br/>
					he is well released by insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ten ways of Ariyan living,<br/>
					according to which Ariyans have lived,<br/>
					do live<br/>
					and shall live.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk one who has abandoned five factors?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk has abandoned sensual desires,<br/>
					malevolence,<br/>
					sloth-and-torpor,<br/>
					worry-and-flurry,<br/>
					doubt-and-wavering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is one who has abandoned five factors.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk one who is possessed of six factors?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, seeing an object with the eye,<br/>
					is not elated or depressed,<br/>
					but lives indifferent,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and composed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the ear,<br/>
					is not elated or depressed,<br/>
					but lives indifferent,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and composed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Smelling a scent with the <span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span> nose,<br/>
					is not elated or depressed,<br/>
					but lives indifferent,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and composed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Tasting a savour with the tongue,<br/>
					is not elated or depressed,<br/>
					but lives indifferent,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and composed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Contacting an object with the body,<br/>
					is not elated or depressed,<br/>
					but lives indifferent,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and composed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">With mind cognizing mental states,<br/>
					is not elated or depressed,<br/>
					but lives indifferent,<br/>
					mindful<br/>
					and composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is a monk possessed of six factors.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a monk guard one factor?</p>

					<p class="f4">By guarding mindfulness<br/>
					he is composed in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he guards one factor.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a monk observe the four bases?</p>

						

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk deliberately<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> follows one thing,<br/>
					deliberately endures another thing;<br/>
					avoids one thing,<br/>
					suppresses another thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a monk observes the four bases.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk one who has shaken off individual beliefs?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, whatsoever individual beliefs generally prevail among the generality of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">The world is eternal;<br/>
					the world is not;<br/>
					the world is finite;<br/>
					it is not;<br/>
					what life is,<br/>
					that is body: or,<br/>
					life is one thing,<br/>
					body another; or,<br/>
					a wayfarer exists beyond death, or,<br/>
					a wayfarer exists not beyond death; or,<br/>
					he both exists and yet exists not; or<br/>
					he neither exists nor exists not beyond death -<br/>
					all these beliefs are shaken off,<br/>
					put away,<br/>
					given up,<br/>
					let go,<br/>
					abandoned<br/>
					and dismissed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is a monk one who has shaken off individual beliefs.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk one who has utterly given up longings?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein in a monk longing for things sensual is abandoned,<br/>
					longing for becoming is abandoned,<br/>
					longing for the brahma-life has calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is a monk one who has utterly given up longings.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how are a monk's thoughts unclouded?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk has abandoned thoughts sensual,<br/>
					thoughts malicious,<br/>
					thoughts of harming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus are his thoughts unclouded.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk's body-complex tranquillized?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, by abandoning pleasure and pain,<br/>
					by coming <span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span> to an end of the ease and discomfort which he had before,<br/>
					attains and abides in a state of neither pain nor pleasure,<br/>
					an equanimity of utter purity<br/>
					which is the fourth musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus his body-complex is tranquillized.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk well released in heart?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk's heart is released from passion,<br/>
					hate<br/>
					and delusion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus is a monk well released in heart.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk well released by insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk knows for certain:</p>

					<p class="f4">Passion is abandoned in me,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made not to become again,<br/>
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Hatred,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made not to become again,<br/>
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Delusion is abandoned in me,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made not to become again,<br/>
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is a monk well released by insight.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever Ariyans have in past time<br/>
					lived according to the Ariyan living,<br/>
					all of them lived according to these ten ways of Ariyan living.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever Ariyans shall in future time so<br/>
					live according to the Ariyan living,<br/>
					all of them shall live according to these ten ways of Ariyan living.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever Ariyans do now so<br/>
					live according to the Ariyan living,<br/>
					all of them do live according to these ten ways of Ariyan living.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the ten ways of Ariyan living,<br/>
					according to which Ariyans have lived,<br/>
					do live<br/>
					and shall live.</p>
