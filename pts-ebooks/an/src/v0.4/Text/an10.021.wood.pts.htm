					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the lion, king of beasts, at eventide comes forth from his lair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having come forth from his lair he stretches himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so, he surveys the four quarters in all directions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done that he utters thrice his lion's roar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thrice having uttered his lion's roar<br/>
					he sallies forth in search of prey.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">(He roars with the idea:)</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let me not cause<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the destruction of tiny creatures wandering astray.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As for the word 'lion,' monks,<br/>
					this is a term for the Wayfarer who is arahant,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Inasmuch <span class="f2 g"><b>[24]</b></span> as the Wayfarer teaches dhamma in the company,<br/>
