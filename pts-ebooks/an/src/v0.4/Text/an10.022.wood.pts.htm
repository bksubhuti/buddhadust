					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side<br/>
					and the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever things, Ānanda,<br/>
					conduce to realizing the truth<br/>
					of this or that statement of doctrine,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					confidently do I claim,<br/>
					after thorough comprehension of it,<br/>
					to teach dhamma about them<br/>
					in such a way that,<br/>
					when proficient,<br/>
					a man shall know of the real that it is,<br/>
					of the unreal that it is not;<br/>
					of the mean that it is mean,<br/>
					of the exalted that it is exalted;<br/>
					of that which has something beyond it,<br/>
					that it has something beyond it;<br/>
					of that which is unsurpassed,<br/>
					that it is unsurpassed.</p>

					<p class="f4">For there is the possibility<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of his knowing<br/>
					or seeing<br/>
					or realizing that which can be known,<br/>
					seen or realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is knowledge unsurpassable,<br/>
					the knowledge of this or that thing<br/>
					as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">Than this knowledge, Ānanda,<br/>
					there is no other knowledge surpassing it<br/>
					or more excellent,<br/>
					I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, there are these ten Wayfarer's powers<br/>
					of the Wayfarer<br/>
					possessed of which powers<br/>
					the Wayfarer claims leadership,<br/>
					roars his lion's roar in the companies<br/>
					and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, the Wayfarer knows,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					causal occasion (of a thing) as such,<br/>
					and what is not causal occasion as such.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Ānanda, the Wayfarer knows,<br/>
