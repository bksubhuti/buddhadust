					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these ten ranges of the devices.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">One person perceives the earth-device<br/>
					as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another person perceives the water-device<br/>
					as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another person perceives the heat-device<br/>
					as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another person perceives the air-device<br/>
					as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another person perceives the blue-green<br/>
					as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another person perceives the yellow<br/>
					as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another person perceives the red<br/>
					as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another person perceives the white<br/>
					as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another person perceives the space-device<br/>
					as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another person perceives the intellection-device<br/>
					as above, below, across, as undivided, as immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ten ranges of the devices."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Kasiṇ'āyatanāni,</i> ranges, spheres or applications of the physical appliances or objects of concentration to induce self-hypnotism, during which the higher senses are called into action. See <i>A.</i> i, 41 = <i>G.S.</i> i, 37; <i>D.</i> iii, 268, 290; <i>Path of Purity,</i> ii, 138 ff.; <i>Manual of a Mystic, passim.</i> It would appear that the different methods were suited to different psychic temperaments. See the next sutta. The last two differ in some passages; <i>cf.</i> <i>V.M.</i> trans. p. 202. The space-device appears to refer to feats in four-dimensional matter. <i>V.M.</i> and our <i>Comy.</i> (as noted at <i>AA.</i> i, 77) do not discuss <i>viññāṇa-kasiṇa,</i> but probably it refers to a mental image <i>(anantaṃ viññāṇan ti ārammanaṃ katvā esa viññāṇañ cāyatana-samāpattiṃ bhāvento viññāṇa-kasiṇaṃ bhāveti ti vuccati).</i> See <i>Expositor</i> i, 248.</p>
