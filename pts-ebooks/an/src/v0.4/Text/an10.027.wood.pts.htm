					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great number of monks,<br/>
					robing themselves in the forenoon<br/>
					and taking bowl and robe,<br/>
					set out for Sāvatthī<br/>
					questing for alms-food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it occurred to those monks thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It is full early yet to range Sāvatthī for alms-food.<br/>
					Suppose we visit the park of the Wanderers holding other views."</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly they did so,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span>  and on getting there greeted them courteously, and,<br/>
					after the exchange of greetings and reminiscent talk,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So seated those Wanderers of other views said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, Gotama the recluse thus teaches dhamma:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Come ye, monks,<br/>
					do ye thoroughly grasp all dhamma,<br/>
					do ye dwell ever and always thoroughly grasping all dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, your reverences,<br/>
					we also thus teach dhamma to our followers:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Come, your reverences,<br/>
					do ye thoroughly grasp all dhamma;<br/>
					do ye ever and always dwell thoroughly grasping all dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, your reverences,<br/>
					pray what is the distinction,<br/>
					what is the specific feature,<br/>
					what is the difference between Gotama the recluse and ourselves,<br/>
					<span class="f2">[49]</span>that is, between his teaching of dhamma and ours,<br/>
					or his way of instruction and ours?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon those monks made no reply,<br/>

					but without expressing either approval or disapproval<br/>
					they rose up and went away, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"We will learn the meaning of this saying<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So those monks,<br/>
					after ranging Sāvatthī for alms-food,<br/>
					on returning from their alms-round<br/>
					and after eating their meal,<br/>
					went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So seated they said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, here in the forenoon we robed ourselves<br/>
					and taking bowl and robe,<br/>
					set out for Sāvatthī<br/>
					questing for alms-food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it occurred to us thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'It is full early yet to range Sāvatthī for alms-food.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated those Wanderers of other views said this to us:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your reverences, Gotama the recluse thus teaches dhamma:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Come ye, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now, your reverences,<br/>
