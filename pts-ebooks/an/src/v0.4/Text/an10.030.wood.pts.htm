					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the raja Pasenadi of Kosala<br/>
					had just returned from a sham<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> fight,<br/>
					having being victorious,<br/>
					and attained his object.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the raja turned<br/>
					in the direction of the Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">So far as the cart-road went<br/>
					he rode in his chariot,<br/>
					and then got down and reached the residence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>
					a number of monks were walking up and down in the open air.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Pasenadi the raja of Kosala went towards those monks,<br/>
					and on reaching them thus accosted them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, your reverences,<br/>
					where now is the Exalted One staying,<br/>
					that arahant,<br/>
					the fully enlightened one?</p>

					<p class="f4">I long to behold that Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yonder is his lodging, maharaja,<br/>
					with the door shut.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you go up quietly without nervousness,<br/>
					enter the verandah,<br/>
					cough and rattle the door-bar.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One will open the door to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the raja Pasenadi of Kosala<br/>
					went up to the lodging<br/>
					as he was told,<br/>
					coughed and rattled the door-bar.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One opened the door.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Pasenadi entered the lodging,<br/>
					fell with his head at the <span class="f2 g"><b>[47]</b></span> feet of the Exalted One,<br/>
					kissed his feet<br/>
					and stroked them with his hands,<br/>
					and announced his name,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, I am Pasenadi, the raja of Kosala,<br/>
					Pasenadi the raja of Kosala am I."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[66]</span>"But, maharaja, seeing what significance therein<br/>
					do you show me this profound humility<br/>

					<p class="f4">For the Exalted One, sir,<br/>
