					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Upāli came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what ten qualities should a monk possess in order to be considered fit for passing sentence?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"He should possess ten qualities, Upāli, for such a purpose.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Upāli,<br/>
					a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligation,<br/>
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct,<br/>
					seeing cause for fear in the slightest faults,<br/>
					he takes up and trains himself in the rules of morality.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he has heard much,<br/>
					bears in mind what he has heard,<br/>
					he hoards up what he has heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those teachings which are alike lovely at the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely at the end (of life),<br/>
					proclaim in the spirit and the letter<br/>
					the all-fulfilled,<br/>
					the utterly purified brahma-life -<br/>
					suchlike are the teachings he has much heard,<br/>
					borne in mind,<br/>
					practised in speech,<br/>
					pondered in the heart,<br/>
					rightly penetrated by view.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By him both of the obligations<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in full<br/>
					are thoroughly learned by heart,<br/>
					well analysed,<br/>
					with thorough knowledge of the meaning,<br/>
					clearly divided sutta by sutta<br/>
					and in minute <span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span> detail.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover he is established in the discipline, immovable therein.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is competent to make both parties in a dispute understand,<br/>
					to win them over,<br/>
					to make them see,<br/>
					to reconcile them.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[72]</span>He is skilled in the rise and settlement of disputes,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he knows the matter at issue,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he knows the cause of its rise,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he knows the way to end it,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he knows the procedure leading to the ending of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing these ten qualities<br/>
					a monk is to be considered fit for passing sentence."</p>
