					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Upāli came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, how must a monk be qualified in order to give full ordination?</p>

					<p class="f4">'He must possess ten qualities, Upāli, in order to do so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligation,<br/>
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct,<br/>
					seeing cause for fear in the slightest faults,<br/>
					he takes up and trains himself in the rules of morality.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he has heard much,<br/>
					bears in mind what he has heard,<br/>
					he hoards up what he has heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those teachings which are alike lovely at the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely at the end (of life),<br/>
					proclaim in the spirit and the letter<br/>
					the all-fulfilled,<br/>
					the utterly purified brahma-life -<br/>
					suchlike are the teachings he has much heard,<br/>
					borne in mind,<br/>
					practised in speech,<br/>
					pondered in the heart,<br/>
					rightly penetrated by view.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By him the obligation in full is thoroughly learned by heart,<br/>
					well analysed,<br/>
					with thorough knowledge of the meaning,<br/>
					clearly divided sutta by sutta<br/>
					and in minute detail.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is competent to attend to the sick<br/>
					or to cause such attendance.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is competent to calm discontent<br/>
					or cause it to be calmed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is competent to restrain bad conduct in accordance with dhamma (lawfully) (or to see that it is done)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is competent to dissuade the adoption of theories (or to see that it is done)<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is competent to establish one in the higher virtue.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is competent to establish one in the higher thought.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is competent to establish one in the higher insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">One must possess these ten qualities, Upāli,<br/>
					in order to give full ordination.'</p>
