					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Upāli came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, by a monk how qualified should tutelage<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> be assigned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He must possess ten qualities, Upāli, in order to assign tutelage.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligation,<br/>
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct,<br/>
					seeing cause for fear in the slightest faults,<br/>
					he takes up and trains himself in the rules of morality.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he has heard much,<br/>
					bears in mind what he has heard,<br/>
					he hoards up what he has heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those teachings which are alike lovely at the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely at the end (of life),<br/>
					proclaim in the spirit and the letter<br/>
					the all-fulfilled,<br/>
					the utterly purified brahma-life -<br/>
					suchlike are the teachings he has much heard,<br/>
					borne in mind,<br/>
					practised in speech,<br/>
					pondered in the heart,<br/>
					rightly penetrated by view.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By him the obligation in full is thoroughly learned by heart,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Bhk. Bodhi has this as a separate sutta. Woodward has abridged this such that the two questions are put as one where the question asked is: "... a monk how qualified should tutelage be assigned ...<i>[his ellipsis]</i> and a novice provided for?" and words the conclusion: "... must possess ... in order to assign tutelage and provide for a novice." The question is ambiguous concerning whether this means caring for a novice or having a novice assigned as an attendant. The answer implies that the issue is the care of the novice. The wording here has been reworked to fit a separate question and answer and with the idea that the question is the qualifications of the bhikkhu to have an attendent. See: Bhk. Bodhi where he has this as "...possess to be attended upon by a novice?" and "...may be attended upon by a novice." <i>bhikkhunā sāmaṇero upaṭṭhāpetabbo</i></p>
