					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Upāli came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, sir, what are the roots of quarrels?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein, Upāli,<br/>
					monks proclaim not-dhamma as dhamma</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and dhamma as not-dhamma;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">monks proclaim not-discipline as discipline</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and discipline as not-discipline;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">proclaim what was not said, not uttered by the Wayfarer<br/>
					as being his words and utterance;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">proclaim his words and utterance<br/>
					as not said, not uttered;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">proclaim what was not practised by the Wayfarer<br/>
					as his practice,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and the reverse;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">proclaim what was not ordained by the Wayfarer<br/>
					as ordained by him,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">and the reverse.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">These ten, Upāli, are the roots of quarrels'</p>
