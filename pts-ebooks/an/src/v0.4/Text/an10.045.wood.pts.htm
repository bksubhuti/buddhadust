					<hr/>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these ten disadvantages of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion, monks,<br/>
					suppose the rāgā is seated with his favourite wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then in comes a monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wife, on seeing the monk,<br/>
					smiles,<br/>
					or else the monk smiles<br/>
					on seeing her.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the rāgā thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely these two are guilty<br/>
					or will be guilty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, suppose the rāgā,<br/>
					his mind being much occupied with business,<br/>
					has intercourse with a certain woman and for- <span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span> gets about it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby she becomes pregnant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the rāgā thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No one but a home-leaver<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> enters here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe it is the work of a home-leaver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, perhaps some gem is missing in the royal court.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the rāgā thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No one but a home-leaver enters here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe it is the work of a home-leaver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the secret plans<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> within the royal court,<br/>
					by being divulged abroad,<br/>
					are spoiled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the rāgā thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No one but a home-leaver enters here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe it is the work of a home-leaver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, in the royal court<br/>
					a father aspires for a son<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					or a son aspires for a father.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No one but a home-leaver enters here.</p>

					<p class="f4">It must be the work of a home-leaver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a rāgā sets up a man of low estate<br/>
					in a high place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those to whom this is displeasing think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The rajā is intimate with the home-leaver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be the work of the home-leaver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the rāgā puts a man of high estate<br/>
					in a low place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those to whom this is displeasing think think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The rajā is intimate with the home-leaver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be the work of the home-leaver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the seventh disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the rāgā musters the host unseasonably.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those to whom this is displeasing think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The rāgā is intimate with the home-leaver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be the work of the home-leaver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the eighth disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the rāgā,<br/>
					after mustering the host at the proper time,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[59]</b></span> sends it back from the high-road.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those to whom this is displeasing think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The rāgā is intimate with the home-leaver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be the work of the home-leaver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ninth disadvantage of entering the royal court.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, monks,<br/>
					the rāgā's court is crowded<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> with elephants, horses and chariots;<br/>
					objects,<br/>
					sounds,<br/>
					scents<br/>
					and savours<br/>
					that are defiling<br/>
					have to be encountered,<br/>
					such as are not suited to one<br/>
					who has given up (the world).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the tenth disadvantage of entering the rāgā's court.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, monks, these are the ten disadvantages of entering the rāgā's court.'</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="demi"/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Pabbajita,</i> 'gone-forth' is not necessarily a monk or <i>bkikkhu</i> of the Order.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Antepure guyha-mantā (Comy. guyhitabba-mantā) bahiddhā sambhedaṃ gacchanti.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> iii, 129 (G.S. iii, 99), where in a similar phrase Mr. Hare seems to take <i>mantā</i> as equal to <i>manta</i>(r). <i>Mantā</i> here is 'secret,' formulas, charms, or decisions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Pitā vā puttaṃ pattheti, putto vā pitaraṃ pattheti.</i> As far as I can see, this can only refer to the uncertainty of parentage in a royal harem. <i>Comy.</i> merely has the strange comment <i>māretuṃ icchati</i> (longs to kill)! The mendicant friar is suspected of causing the confusion.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Text quite unsuitably reads <i>sammada</i> (drowsiness), but with <i>v.l.</i> <i>sammadda:</i> so also <i>Comy.</i>, which explains as equal to <i>sambādha.</i> <i>Cf.</i> the passage at <i>K.S.</i> v, 303 <i>ff.,</i> where the chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa complain of the difficulties of official life at court.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Here I take <i>pabbajitena</i> to mean a bhikkhu.</p>
