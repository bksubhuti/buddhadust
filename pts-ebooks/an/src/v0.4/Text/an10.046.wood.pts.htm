					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time a number of Sakyan lay-followers,<br/>
					that day being the sabbath,<br/>
					came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Exalted One said this to those Sakyan lay-followers:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Sakyans, are you keeping the sabbath complete in its eight parts?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Sometimes, sir, we do so,<br/>
					but maybe sometimes we don't"</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Sakyans, in those matters<br/>
					it is no gain to you,<br/>
					it is ill gotten by you,<br/>
					since, in a life thus conjoined to fear of grief,<br/>
					in a life thus conjoined to fear of death,<br/>
					ye sometimes do<br/>
					and sometimes maybe do not<br/>
					keep the sabbath complete in its eight parts.</p>
