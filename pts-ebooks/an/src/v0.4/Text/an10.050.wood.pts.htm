					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion a number of monks<br/>
					after returning from their alms-round<br/>
					and eating their meal,<br/>
					as they sat assembled together in the service-hall,<br/>
					remained in strife and uproar and dispute,<br/>
					abusing each other<br/>
					with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One at eventide,<br/>
					rising from his solitude,<br/>
					approached the service-hall,<br/>
					and on reaching it<br/>
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had sat down<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, monks, in what talk were ye engaged<br/>
					as ye sit here,<br/>
					and what was the topic of your talk<br/>
					left unfinished?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, sir, after returning from our alms-round<br/>
					and eating our meal,<br/>
					we sat assembled together in the service-hall<br/>
					and remained in strife, uproar and dispute,<br/>
					abusing each other<br/>
					with the weapons of the tongue."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, it is not seemly for you clansmen,<br/>
					who in faith went forth from home to the homeless,<br/>
					thus to abide in strife, uproar and dispute,<br/>
					abusing each other<br/>
					with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are these ten conditions to be re- <span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span> membered,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Herein a monk is virtuous,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					restrained with the restraint of the obligation,<br/>
