					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, though a monk be not skilled<br/>
					in the habit of others' thoughts,<br/>
					at least he can resolve:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will be skilled<br/>
					in the habit of my own thought.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, should ye train yourselves.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk skilled<br/>
					in the habit of his own thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, monks, a woman or man or a young lad<br/>
					fond of self-adornment,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					examining the reflection of his own face<br/>
					in a bright clean mirror<br/>
					or bowl of clear water,<br/>
					should see therein a stain<br/>
					or speck<br/>
					and strive for the removal of that stain<br/>
					or speck;<br/>
					and when he no longer sees it there<br/>
					is pleased and satisfied thereat, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A gain it is to me that I am clean' -<br/>
					even so a monk's introspection<br/>
					is most fruitful in good conditions, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Am I or am I not<br/>
					a winner of peace of heart in my own self?</p>

					<p class="f4">Am I or am I not<br/>
					a winner of insight of the higher<br/>
					and insight into Dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, on self-examination a monk knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a winner of peace of heart in my own self,<br/>
					but not a winner of wisdom of the higher<br/>
					and insight into Dhamma' -<br/>
					then he <span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span> must put forth effort<br/>
					to establish peace of heart in his own self<br/>
					and acquire insight of the higher<br/>
					and insight into Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then on some later occasion<br/>
					he is a winner of both alike.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, on self-examination a monk knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a winner of insight of the higher<br/>
					and insight into Dhamma,<br/>
					but not of peace of heart in my own self' -<br/>
					then he must make an effort<br/>
					to establish insight of the higher<br/>
					and insight into Dhamma,<br/>
					<br/>
					and acquire peace of heart in his own self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then on some later occasion he is winner of both alike.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if on self-examination a monk knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am not a winner of either quality,'<br/>
					then he must put forth extra desire,<br/>
					effort,<br/>
					endeavour,<br/>
					exertion,<br/>
					unflagging mindfulness<br/>
					and attention<br/>
					for the acquiring<br/>
					of those profitable conditions.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, when one's turban or head is ablaze,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					for the extinguishing thereof<br/>
					one must put forth extra desire,<br/>
					effort,<br/>
					endeavour,<br/>
					exertion,<br/>
					unflagging mindfulness<br/>
					and attention,<br/>
					even so for acquiring of those profitable conditions<br/>
					one must put forth extra desire,<br/>
					effort,<br/>
					endeavour,<br/>
					exertion,<br/>
					impulse,<br/>
					unflagging mindfulness<br/>
					and attention<br/>
					for acquiring of those profitable conditions.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <span class="f2">[100]</span> at some future time<br/>
					he is a winner both of peace of heart in his own self<br/>
					and insight of the higher<br/>
					and insight into Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, on self-examination<br/>
					a monk finds that he has both qualities,<br/>
					then he must make an effort<br/>
					to establish just those profitable conditions,<br/>
					and further to destroy the cankers.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">As to the robe, monks,<br/>
					I declare that it is to be sought after<br/>
					or not sought after in a twofold way.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I spoke of the robe being sought after or not sought after in a twofold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why was this said?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this matter if one know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'By seeking after this robe<br/>
					unprofitable states wane in me<br/>

					such robe should be sought after.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is why I said this about the robe.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward's abridgement would indicate that the list of qualities found in the previous sutta is repeated here. The PTS and BJT Pali texts do not indicate any abridgement here and to include this list would not fit the construction. It could be done as a 'wheel' in which case the 'formula' would need to be repeated for each quality accumulating the previous qualities for the first condition in each case. Bhk. Bodhi has used three different versions of the Pali text and has the construction as here.</p>
