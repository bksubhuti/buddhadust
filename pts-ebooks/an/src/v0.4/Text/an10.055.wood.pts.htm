					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, your reverences."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence," replied those monks to the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					who then said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, there is the frequent saying</p>

					<p class="f4">'A person whose nature is to wane.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now to what extent has a person been called by the Exalted One</p>

					<p class="f4">'a person whose nature is to wane,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and to what extent has a person been called</p>

					<p class="f4">'A person whose nature is to wax'?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"We would come from far, your reverence,<br/>
					to know the meaning of this<br/>
					in the presence of the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well if the meaning of this saying<br/>
					were to occur to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[103]</span> Hearing it from the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					the monks would bear it in mind."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, your reverences, do ye listen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pay attention carefully<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will, your reverence,"<br/>
					replied those monks to the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					who then said:</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now to what extent was a person called<br/>
					'of a nature to wane'<br/>
					by the Exalted One?</p>

						

					<p class="f4">Herein, your reverences, a monk listens not<br/>
					to a teaching not heard before,<br/>
					while the teachings he has heard<br/>
					go to confusion;<br/>
					those teachings formerly contacted by thought<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					no longer occur to him,<br/>
					and he understands not what is unintelligible.</p>

					<p class="f4">To this extent was a person called<br/>
					'one of a nature to wane'<br/>
					by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And to what extent was a person called<br/>
					'of a nature to wax'<br/>
					by the Exalted One?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, your reverences, a monk listens to a teaching not heard before,<br/>
					while the teachings he has heard<br/>
					do not go to confusion;<br/>
					those teachings formerly contacted by thought<br/>
					continue to occur to him,<br/>
					and he understands what is unintelligible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though a monk be not skilled in the habit of others' hearts,<br/>
					yet he can resolve:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will be skilled in the habit of my own heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That, your reverences, is how ye must train yourselves.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk skilled in the habit of his own heart?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[104]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[71]</b></span> Just as if, monks, a woman or man<br/>
					or a young lad<br/>
					fond of self-adornment,<br/>
					examining the reflection of his own face<br/>
					in a bright clean mirror<br/>
					or bowl of clear water,<br/>
					should see therein a stain<br/>
					or speck<br/>
					and strive for the removal of that stain<br/>
					or speck;<br/>
					and when he no longer sees it there<br/>
					is pleased and satisfied thereat, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A gain it is to me that I am clean' -<br/>
					even so a monk's introspection<br/>
					is most fruitful in good conditions, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do I or do I not generally live covetous?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is this condition to be seen in me or not?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Am I a winner of delight in Dhamma?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Is this condition to be seen in me or not?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If, your reverences, a monk<br/>
					on self-examination finds:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All these profitable conditions are not in my self' -</p>

					<p class="f4">then for the acquiring of all these profitable conditions<br/>

					endeavour,<br/>
					exertion,<br/>
					unflagging mindfulness<br/>

					for the acquiring<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, when one's turban or head is ablaze,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, your reverences,<br/>
					on self-examination<br/>
					a monk finds some profitable conditions in himself,<br/>
					but not others,<br/>
					<span class="f2">[105]</span> then, for the establishment of those profitable conditions<br/>
