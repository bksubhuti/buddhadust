					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying among the Magadhese at Nālakagāmaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Wanderer Sāmaṇḍakāni came to see the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					and on coming to him greeted him courteously and,<br/>
					after the exchange of courtesies and reminiscent talk,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Sāriputta, your reverence,<br/>
					in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>
					what is weal and what is woe?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence, when there is discontent<br/>
					this woe may be looked for:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether one goes,<br/>
					stands,<br/>
					sits,<br/>
					or lies,<br/>
					he reaches not happiness and pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he has gone to the forest,<br/>
					to the root of a tree,<br/>
					to a lonely place,<br/>
					to life in the open air,<br/>
					to life amid the monks,<br/>
					he reaches not happiness and pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is discontent,<br/>
					this woe may be looked for.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is content, your reverence,<br/>
					this weal may be looked for:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether one goes,<br/>
					stands,<br/>
					sits<br/>
					or lies,<br/>
					he reaches happiness and pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he has gone to the forest,<br/>
					to the root of a tree,<br/>
					to a lonely place,<br/>
					to a life in the open air<br/>
					or life amid the monks,<br/>
					he reaches happiness and pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is content, your reverence,<br/>
					this weal may be looked for."</p>
