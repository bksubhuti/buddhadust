					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was going his rounds among the Kosalans<br/>
					together with a number of monks,<br/>
					and came to Naḷakapāna,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					a Kosalan township of that name.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One resided at Judas-Tree Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					the Exalted One was seated surrounded by monks,<br/>
					the day being the sabbath.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One<br/>
					for much of the night<br/>
					had instructed,<br/>
					stirred,<br/>
					fired,<br/>
					and gladdened the monks<br/>
					with a talk about dhamma<br/>
					on looking round<br/>
					and seeing that the order of monks was perfectly silent,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					he called to the venerable Sāriputta, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sāri- <span class="f2 g"><b>[84]</b></span> putta, the order of monks <span class="f2">[123]</span> has banished sloth-and-torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let some dhamma-talk occur to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">My back aches.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, sir," replied the venerable Sāriputta to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One had his robe spread fourfold,<br/>
					and lying on his right side<br/>
					he took up the lion-posture,<br/>
					resting foot on foot,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					fixing his thoughts on rising up again.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Sāriputta called to the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, your reverences."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Sāriputta, your reverence,"<br/>
					replied those monks to the venerable Sāriputta, who said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, whosoever hath not faith in good states,<br/>
