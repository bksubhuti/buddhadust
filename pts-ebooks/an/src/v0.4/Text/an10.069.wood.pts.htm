					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion a number of monks,<br/>
					after returning from their alms-round<br/>
					and eating their meal,<br/>
					had gathered and sat down in the service-hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">There they stayed<br/>
					indulging in divers sorts of aimless talk<br/>
					about such things as:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rājahs,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span> robbers and great ministers;<br/>
					talk of armies, panic and battle;<br/>
					talk of food and 'animal talk,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					drink, clothes, beds, flowers, garlands and perfumes;<br/>
					talk of relatives, vehicles, villages, townships, cities and districts;<br/>
					talk about women and champions,<br/>
					about streets and gossip at the well:<br/>
					ghost stories,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					desultory talk<br/>
					and fables about (the origin of) land and sea;<br/>
					and talk of becoming and not-becoming.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One<br/>
					rising from his solitude at eventide<br/>
					went towards the service-hall,<br/>
					and on reaching it<br/>
					sat down on a seat made ready.<br/>
					Being seated the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, monks, on what subjects were ye conversing<br/>
					gathered together here,<br/>
					and what was the nature<br/>
					of the talk left unfinished by you?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, after returning from our alms-round<br/>
					and eating our meal<br/>
					we gathered and sat down here in the service-hall<br/>
					and so stayed<br/>
					indulging in divers sorts of pointless talk, such as:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rājahs,<br/>
					robbers and great ministers;<br/>
					talk of armies, panic and battle;<br/>
					talk of food and 'animal talk,'<br/>
					drink, clothes, beds, flowers, garlands and perfumes;<br/>
					talk of relatives, vehicles, villages, townships, cities and districts;<br/>
					talk about women and champions,<br/>
					about streets and gossip at the well:<br/>
					ghost stories,<br/>
					desultory talk<br/>
					and fables about (the origin of) land and sea;<br/>
					and talk of becoming and not-becoming.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, it is not seemly<br/>
					that ye clansmen <span class="f2">[129]</span> who in faith<br/>
					have gone forth from the home to the homeless<br/>
					should indulge in such talk.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these ten topics of talk.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Talk about wanting little,<br/>
					about contentment,<br/>
					seclusion,<br/>
					solitude,<br/>
					energetic striving,<br/>
					virtue,<br/>
					concentration,<br/>
					insight,<br/>
					release,<br/>
					release by knowing and seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the ten topics of talk.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if ye should engage again and again<br/>
					in talk on these ten topics,<br/>
					ye would outshine in brilliance<br/>
					even the brilliance of moon and sun,<br/>
					which are of such mighty power and majesty<br/>
					— not to speak of the brilliance<br/>
					of the Wanderers who hold other views.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

A similar comment is on <i>Petavatthu</i> iv, 3 s.v. Moriya, where <i>Comy.</i> has, 'Here he is speaking of Dharmasoka.' <i>Petav.</i> and <i>Vimāna-vatthu</i> both seem of late date anyhow.
