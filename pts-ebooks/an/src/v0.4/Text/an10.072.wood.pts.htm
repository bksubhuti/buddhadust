					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Vesāli in Great Grove,<br/>
					at the House with the Peaked Roof,<br/>
					together with a number of senior monks who were his disciples-namely,<br/>
					the venerable Cāla,<br/>
					Upacāla,<br/>
					Kakkaṭa,<br/>
					Kaḷimbha,<br/>
					Nikaṭa,<br/>
					and Kaṭissaha<br/>
					and other notable monks.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion a crowd of notable Licchavites,<br/>
					riding in their splendid cars<br/>
					in rivalry<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> with din and uproar,<br/>
					were dashing into Great Wood<br/>
					to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those venerable ones thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here is a crowd of notable Licchavites,<br/>
					riding in their splendid cars<br/>
					in rivalry with din and uproar,<br/>
					were dashing into Great Wood<br/>
					to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it has been said by the Exalted One<br/>
					that noise is a thorn to musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we retreat to Gosinga Wood<br/>
					where is the sal grove;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					<span class="f2">[134]</span>there we can stay pleasantly,<br/>
					free from noise and crowds."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So those venerable ones retreated to Gosinga Wood,<br/>
					where is the sal grove,<br/>
					and there they stayed pleasantly,<br/>
					free from noise and crowds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Later on the Exalted One called to the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, where is  Cāla,<br/>
					Upacāla,<br/>
					Kakkaṭa,<br/>
					Kaḷimbha,<br/>
					Nikaṭa,<br/>
					and Kaṭissaha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Where are those monks,<br/>
					my senior disciples,<br/>
					gone?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span> "As to that, sir, it occurred to those venerable ones:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here is a crowd of notable Licchavites,<br/>
					riding in their splendid cars<br/>
					in rivalry with din and uproar,<br/>
					dashing into Great Wood<br/>
					to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it has been said by the Exalted One<br/>
					that noise is a thorn to musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we retreat to Gosinga Wood,<br/>
					where is the sal grove;<br/>
					there we can stay pleasantly,<br/>
					free from noise and crowds.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So, sir, those venerable ones are gone there.</p>

					<p class="f4">There they are staying pleasantly,<br/>
					free from noise and crowds."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said! Well said, monks!</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who should assert<br/>
					what those great disciples have asserted<br/>
					would rightly do so.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, monks, I have said<br/>
					that noise is a thorn to musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these ten thorns.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[1]</b> To one who delights in seclusion<br/>
					delight in society is a thorn.</p>

						

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[2]</b> To one devoted to concentration on the mark of the foul<br/>
					concentration on the mark of the fair is a thorn.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[3]</b> To one guarding the doors of the sense-faculties<br/>
					the sight of shows<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is a thorn.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[4]</b> To the Brahma-life<br/>
					consorting with womenfolk is a thorn.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[135]</span> <b>[5]</b> To the first musing<br/>
					sound is a thorn;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[6]</b> to the second musing<br/>
					thought directed and sustained is a thorn;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[7]</b> to the third musing<br/>
					zest is a thorn;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[8]</b> to the fourth musing<br/>
					in-breathing and out-breathing is a thorn.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[9]</b> To the attainment of the ending of awareness-and-feeling<br/>
					awareness-and-feeling are a thorn.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[10]</b> Lust, malice and delusion are thorns.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, monks, do ye abide thornless,<br/>
					do ye abide thorn-removers,<br/>
					do ye abide thornless thorn-removers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the thornless are arahants,<br/>
					the thornless thorn-removers are arahants."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> has nothing about these elders.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Text's <i>carapurāya,</i> as <i>P.
