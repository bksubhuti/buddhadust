					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> I read, with <i>v.ll.</i> of text <i>ke ca purisa-puggalā paro-pariya-ñāṇe,</i> instead of all as one word, as text and <i>Comy.</i> and Mr. Hare at <i>G.S.</i> iii, 246. This form of comparison is not uncommon, as below in § 99, If it be not so taken there is no noun to agree with <i>ke.</i> Text has <i>ambhakā</i> for <i>ambakā;</i> <i>v.l.</i> at <i>G.S.</i> iii is <i>amma.</i> I believe the word is not found elsewhere, and would read <i>ammakā</i> ('mummyish'). I take <i>purisa-puggalā</i> as emphatic male as opposed to the other. <i>Paro-pariyañāṇa</i> is used of clairvoyant insight into others' conditions. Elsewhere <i>purisa-puggalā</i> <i>(par excellence)</i> are the eight sets of beings on the eight stages of the Fourfold Path <i>(yadidaṃ cattari purisa-yugāni aṭṭha purisa-puggalā, esa Bhagavato sāmka-sangho).</i> In this case the <i>purisa-puggalā</i> who knows is himself <i>(ahaṃ, yo vā mādiso).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Sāmāyikaṃ,</i> occurring variously as <i>sāmādhika, sāmayika, samāyika;</i> <i>cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> i, 150 <i>n.</i> (where text has <i>sāmādhikaṃ</i>), and <i>SA.</i> i, 182, <i>ad loc.;</i> <i>M.</i> iii, 110. Here <i>Comy.</i> explains 'he does not win <i>pīti-pāmojjaṃ</i>) through seasonably hearing dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> For <i>pamāṇikā pamiṇanti,</i> <i>cf.</i> <i>A.</i> ii, 70. [?]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Dhamma-sota nibbahati.</i> This seems 'ear for dhamma' (which I take to mean 'hearing the voice of conscience'), but is translated 'stream' at <i>K.S.</i> ii, 33, 42 (<i>sotaṃ samāpanno</i>), and at <i>G.S.</i> iii, 248, but I have nowhere seen <i>dhamma-sota</i> in this sense. The reference is to <i>dhamma-savaṇa</i> just above. <i>Comy.</i> 'as he is a champion, it draws out (<i>nibbahati</i>) the knowledge-and-insight existing in him and makes him reach the Ariyan ground.' (However, for <i>soto</i> as <i>magga,</i> see <i>S.</i> v, 247;[?] <i>UdA.</i> 290; and <i>SA.</i> on <i>S.</i> ii, quoted above.) It occurs again at § 12 of the Elevens. Reading with <i>G.S.</i> iii, and <i>Comy.</i> <i>tadantaraṃ = kārcṇaṃ.</i> Text has <i>tadanantaraṃ</i> ('what follows immediately').</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>Khaññati</i> (pass, of <i>khaṇati</i>); <i>cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i, 132, <i>attānaṃ khaṇasi.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> The text here is incomplete-viz., <i>na-y-idha Purāṇo Isidattassa gatim pi aññassa.</i> There is no verb to account for the case of <i>gati</i> (<i>Comy.</i> = <i>ñāṇagatiṃ</i>). I conclude that <i>aññassati</i> (future of <i>jānāti</i>) has been mutilated by confusion with <i>aññassa;</i> or else originally there was no <i>annassa,</i> only <i>gatim pi aññassati.</i></p>
