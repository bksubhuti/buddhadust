					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, were not three states found existing in the world,<br/>
					the Wayfarer would not arise in the world,<br/>
					an arahant rightly enlightened;<br/>
					nor would the Dhamma-discipline proclaimed by the Wayfarer<br/>
					be shown in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three states?</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth, decay and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Were not these three states found existing in the world, the Wayfarer would not arise in the world,<br/>
					an arahant rightly enlightened;<br/>
					nor would the Dhamma-discipline proclaimed by the Wayfarer<br/>
					be shown in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But since these three states are found<br/>
					therefore the Wayfarer does arise in the world,<br/>
					an arahant rightly enlightened,<br/>
					and the Dhamma-discipline proclaimed by the Wayfarer<br/>
					is shown in the world.</p>
