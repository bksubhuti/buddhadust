					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these ten occasions of ill-will.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">One conceives ill-will at the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[1]</b> 'So-and-so has done me harm;<br/>
					<b>[2]</b> he is doing me harm;<br/>
					<b>[3]</b> he is going to do me harm.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">One conceives ill-will at the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[4]</b> 'So-and-so has done harm to one dear and precious to me;<br/>
					<b>[5]</b> he is doing harm,<br/>
					<b>[6]</b> he is going to do harm<br/>
					to one dear and precious to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">One conceives ill-will at the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[7]</b> 'So-and-so has done good<br/>
					to one not dear and precious to me:<br/>
					<b>[8]</b> he is doing good,<br/>
					<b>[9]</b> he is going to do good<br/>
					to one not dear and precious to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[10]</b> And<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> one is groundlessly annoyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ten occasions of ill-will."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward has "Thus" which would indicate that this was a conclusion based on the previous nine and this would leave us with only nine factors. The Pali reads "and": "<i>aṭṭhāne ca."</i> Bhk. Bodhi footnotes with the explanation that this has to do with getting angry when one stubs one's toe on a rock and such things as are not intentional affliction-inflictions.</p>
