					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Kokālikan monk came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires,<br/>
					they are a prey to wicked desires."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

					<p class="f4">Calm your heart towards Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of dear virtues are Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then for a second time the Kokālikan monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires,<br/>
					they are a prey to wicked desires."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the Exalted One reproved him saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

					<p class="f4">Calm your heart towards Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of dear virtues are Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then for a third time the Kokālikan monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires,<br/>
					they are a prey to wicked desires."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time the Exalted One <span class="f2 g"><b>[114]</b></span> reproved him saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

					<p class="f4">Calm your heart towards Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of dear virtues are Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Kokālikan monk rose up from his seat,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					keeping his right side towards him,<br/>
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Not long after he had departed<br/>
					the whole body of the Kokālikan monk<br/>
					broke out with pustules<br/>
					of the size of mustard-seed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">From being of the size of mustard-seed<br/>
					they grew to the size of lentils,<br/>
					then to that of chick-peas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					then to that of kola-nut stones,<br/>
					then to the size of a jujube,<br/>
					then to that of myrobalan,<br/>
					then to that of unripe vilva fruit,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					then to that of billa fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having grown to that size<br/>
					they burst<br/>
					discharging pus and blood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">And there he lay on plantain leaves,<br/>
					just like a poisoned fish.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Tudu, the individual Brahmā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					went to see the Kokālikan monk,<br/>
					and on reaching him<br/>
					stood on a cloud<br/>
					and said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kokālikan,<br/>
					calm your heart towards Sāriputta and Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Of dear virtues are Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who are you, your reverence?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am Tudu,<br/>
					the individual Brahma."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Were you not pronounced a non-returner<br/>
					by the Exalted One?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then how is it that you come here?</p>

					<p class="f4">See how you have erred in this matter."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Tudu the individual Brahmā<br/>
					addressed the Kokālikan monk<br/>
					in these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"In sooth to every man that's born<br/>
							A hatchet grows within his mouth,<br/>
							Wherewith the fool, whene'er he speaks<br/>
							And speaks amiss, doth cut himself.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[115]</b></span> Who praiseth him who should be blamed<br/>
							Or blameth who should praised be,<br/>
							He by his lips stores up ill-luck,<br/>
							And by that ill-luck finds no bliss.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Small is the ill-luck of a man<br/>
							Who gambling loseth all his wealth.<br/>
							Greater by far th' ill-luck of him<br/>
							Who, losing all and losing self,<br/>
							'Gainst the Well-farer's fouls his mind.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whoso reviles the worthy ones,<br/>
							In speech and thought designing ill,<br/>
							For an hundred thousand periods,<br/>
							For six and thirty, with five more<br/>
							Such periods, to purgatory's doomed."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Kokālikan monk<br/>
					met his end by that same sickness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had made an end<br/>
					he rose up again in Paduma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> Purgatory,<br/>
					for hardening his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the night was far spent,<br/>
					the Brahmā Sahampati<br/>
					shedding radiance<br/>
					lit up Jeta Grove from end to end,<br/>
					and came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus standing<br/>
					the Brahmā Sahampati said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, the Kokālikan monk has met his end,<br/>
					and having met his end<br/>
					has risen up again in Paduma Purgatory,<br/>
					for hardening his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>
					and so saying<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					keeping his right side towards him,<br/>
					and vanished there and then.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One,<br/>
					when that night had gone,<br/>
					addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, last night<br/>
					when night was waning<br/>
					the Brahmā <span class="f2 g"><b>[116]</b></span> Sahampati<br/>
					shedding radiance<br/>
					lit up Jeta Grove from end to end,<br/>
					and on coming to me<br/>
					saluted me and<br/>
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus standing<br/>
					the Brahmā Sahampati said this to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, the Kokālikan monk has met his end,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words a certain monk said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, how long is the measure of life in Paduma Purgatory?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Long indeed, monk, is the measure of life in Paduma Purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were no easy thing to reckon it thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">So many years<br/>
					or so many centuries<br/>
					or so many thousands of years<br/>
					or so many hundreds of thousands of years."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, sir, can a figure be made?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It can, monk."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One added:</p>

						
					
					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monk, a Kosalan cartload<br/>
					of twenty measures of sesame seed,<br/>
					and suppose that at the end of every century<br/>
					one took out a single seed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sooner would that Kosalan cartload<br/>
					of twenty measures of sesame seed<br/>
					be used up and finished by this method<br/>
					than the period of the Abbuda Purgatory.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as are twenty such periods of the Abbuda Purgatory,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Just as are twenty such periods of the Puṇḍarlka Purgatory<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monk, it is in the Paduma Purgatory<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Well-farer having thus spoken,<br/>

He had abused the great disciples in a former birth. <i>DhpA.</i> on <i>Dhp.</i> v. 363 describes these gāthās as referring to him. He was a native of the town Kokālī</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> At the porch of Jetavana monastery. This later addition and the appearance of Tudu is in the <i>Jātaka C.,</i> and the previous sutta in the <i>Saṃyutta</i> version is from the Commentaries.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Pacceka Brahmā.</i> Tudu had been K's guru, and on his death was pronounced a non-returner by the Master.</p>
