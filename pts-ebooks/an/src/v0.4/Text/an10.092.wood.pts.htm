					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika came to see the Exalted One<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Housefather, when the fivefold guilty dread<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					is allayed in the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					and he is possessed<br/>
					of the four limbs of stream-winning,<br/>
					and has well seen<br/>
					and well penetrated<br/>
					the Ariyan Method<br/>
					by insight,<br/>
					he may, if he so desire,<br/>
					himself proclaim thus of himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am one who has cut off the doom of Purgatory,<br/>
					of rebirth in the womb of an animal,<br/>
					in the realm of ghosts;<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather,<br/>
