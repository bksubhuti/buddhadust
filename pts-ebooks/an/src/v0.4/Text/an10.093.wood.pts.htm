					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika left Sāvatthī at an early hour<br/>
					to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But it occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not time to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					he is in retirement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is it time to see the monks<br/>
					who make the mind to grow;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					those monks are in retirement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to pay a visit<br/>
					to the Park where dwell<br/>
					the Wanderers who hold other views?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So the housefather Anathapiṇḍika drew near<br/>
					the Park where dwelt<br/>
					the Wanderers holding other views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					the Wanderers holding other views,<br/>
					having come together in a great company,<br/>
					were sitting engaged in divers childish talk,<br/>
					all talking loudly,<br/>
					making a great noise and din.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when they saw the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika approaching,<br/>
					while yet he was at some distance,<br/>
					they hushed each other, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Make little noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make no noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Here comes the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika,<br/>
					a disciple of Gotama the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">This housefather Anāthapiṇḍika<br/>
					is one of those disciples of Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					householders clad in white,<br/>
					who live at Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those worthies are fond of little noise,<br/>
					they are schooled to little noise,<br/>
					they speak in praise of little noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe, if he sees our company making little noise,<br/>
					he will think it worth his while to draw near."</p>

					<p class="f4">So those Wanderers kept silence.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika drew near to those Wanderers,<br/>
					and on coming to them<br/>
					greeted them courteously,<br/>

					<span class="f2">[186]</span>sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>
					those Wanderers said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tell us, housefather,<br/>
					what views does Gotama the recluse hold?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, sirs, I know not<br/>
					all the view of the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span> "You say you know not<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then tell us what view the monks hold."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, sire, of the monks<br/>
					also I know not all the view."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, housefather, since you know not all the view<br/>
					either of Gotama the recluse<br/>
					or of the monks,<br/>
					tell us what sort of view you yourself hold."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, sirs, indeed were no hard task -<br/>
					to tell you of what sort of view I am myself.</p>

					<p class="f4">But first let your reverences<br/>
					expound your own views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Afterwards, it will be not hard task<br/>
					for me to expound what views I hold myself."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words a certain Wanderer said this<br/>
