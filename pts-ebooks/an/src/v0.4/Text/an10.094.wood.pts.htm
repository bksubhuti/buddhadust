					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Campā<br/>
					on the bank of the Lotus Pond at Gaggara.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the housefather Vajjiyamāhita left Campa at an early hour to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But it occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not time to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					he is in retirement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is it time to see the monks<br/>
					who make the mind to grow;<br/>
					those monks are in retirement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to pay a visit<br/>
					to the Park where dwell<br/>
					the Wanderers who hold other views."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So the housefather Vajjiyamāhita drew near<br/>
					the Park where dwelt<br/>
					the Wanderers holding other views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					the Wanderers holding other views,<br/>
					having come together in a great company,<br/>
					were sitting engaged in divers childish talk,<br/>
					all talking loudly,<br/>
					making a great noise and din.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when they saw the housefather Vajjiyamāhita approaching,<br/>
					while yet he was at some distance,<br/>
					they hushed each other, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Make little noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make no noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Here comes the housefather Vajjiyamāhita,<br/>
					a disciple of Gotama the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">This housefather Vajjiyamāhita<br/>
					is one of those disciples of Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					householders clad in white,<br/>
					who live at Campā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those worthies are fond of little noise,<br/>
					they are schooled to little noise,<br/>
					they speak in praise of little noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe, if he sees our company making little noise,<br/>
					he will think it worth his while to draw near."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[190]</span> So those Wanderers kept silence.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So the housefather Vajjiyamāhita drew near to those Wanderers,<br/>
					and on coming to them<br/>
					greeted them courteously,<br/>
					and after courteous greetings<br/>
					and reminiscent talk<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[131]</b></span> sat down at one side.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>
					those Wanderers holding other views said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, housefather,<br/>
					as it is said,<br/>
					that Gotama the recluse blames all ascetic ways,<br/>
					that he downright upbraids and reproaches<br/>
					every ascetic who lives the hard life?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"No indeed, sirs,<br/>
					the Exalted One blames not all ascetic ways,<br/>
					nor does he downright upbraid and reproach<br/>
					every ascetic who lives the hard life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One, sirs,<br/>
					blames the blameworthy,<br/>
					praises the praiseworthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">In so doing the Exalted One is a particularizer;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					that Exalted One is not one<br/>
					who makes sweeping assertions herein."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words a certain Wanderer said this to the housefather Vajjiyamāhita:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stay thou, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">That Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					whose praises you utter,<br/>
					is a nihilist,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					one who defines nothing as certain."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, sir, herein I speak with good reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One has thus defined:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is good;<br/>
					that is bad.'</p>

					<p class="f4">By thus defining good and bad<br/>
					the Exalted One is a definer.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is no nihilist,<br/>
					not one who defines nothing as certain."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[191]</span>At these words those Wanderers were silent,<br/>
					were confounded,<br/>
					hung the head,<br/>
					looked downwards,<br/>
					were disappointed,<br/>
					and sat unable to make reply.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Vajjiyamāhita,<br/>
					seeing that those Wanderers were confounded,<br/>
					hung the head,<br/>
					looked downwards,<br/>
					were disappointed,<br/>
					and sat unable to make reply,<br/>
					rose up from his seat<br/>
					rose up from his seat<br/>
					and went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him,<br/>
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he related<br/>
					all the conversation he had had<br/>
					with the Wanderers holding other views.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well done, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even <span class="f2 g"><b>[132]</b></span> thus reasonably<br/>
					are infatuated people<br/>
					from time to time<br/>
					to be confuted and rebuked by you.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, housefather,<br/>
					I say not that all ascetic ways are to be pursued.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet do I not say<br/>
					that all ascetic ways are not to be pursued.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">I say not that every undertaking,<br/>
					that every effort in training<br/>
					should be undertaken and made.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet do I not say that every undertaking,<br/>
					that every effort in training<br/>
					should not be undertaken and made.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">I say not, housefather,<br/>
					that every renunciation should be made,<br/>
					nor yet that it should not be made.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">I say not that every form of release<br/>
					is to be regarded as such,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					nor yet that it should not be so regarded.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If, housefather, in one practising austerities<br/>
					unprofitable states wax<br/>
					and profitable states wane,<br/>
					such austerity should not be practised, I declare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If in one practising austerities<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[192]</span> If in one undertaking the training<br/>
					unprofitable states wax<br/>
					and profitable states wane,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If in one undertaking the training<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If in one making an effort<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If in one making an effort<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If in one making renunciation<br/>

					<p class="f4">If in one making renunciation<br/>
					unprofitable states wane<br/>
					and profitable states wax,<br/>
					such austerities should be practised, I declare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">If in one who regards himself as released<br/>
					by a certain form of release,<br/>
					unprofitable states wax<br/>
					and profitable states wane,<br/>
					such release should not be regarded as such, I declare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But if in one who regards himself as released<br/>
					by a certain form of release<br/>
					profitable states wax<br/>
					and unprofitable states wane,<br/>
					such form of release should be regarded as release, I declare."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Vajjiyamāhita,<br/>
					being thus instructed,<br/>
					stirred,<br/>
					fired<br/>
					and gladdened by the Exalted One,<br/>
					rose up from his seat,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One by keeping his right side towards him<br/>
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Not long after he had gone<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, any monk who had been for a long time<br/>
					stained with but few faults<br/>
					in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>
					might reasonably<br/>
					from time to time<br/>
					confute and rebuke<br/>
					the Wanderers holding other views,<br/>
					even as they have been confuted<br/>
					by the housefather Vajjiyamāhita."</p>
