					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Wanderer Uttiya came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and reminiscent talk<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Wanderer Uttiya said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Pray, Master Gotama, is the world eternal?<br/>
					Is this the truth and other view infatuation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have not declared, Uttiya:<br/>
					the world is eternal<br/>
					this the truth and other view infatuation."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "How then, Master Gotama, is the world not eternal?<br/>
					Is this the truth and other view infatuation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This also, Uttiya, I have not declared:<br/>
					the world is not eternal<br/>
					this the truth and other view infatuation."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Pray, Master Gotama, is the world limited?<br/>
					Is this the truth and other view infatuation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have not declared, Uttiya:<br/>
					the world is limited<br/>
					this the truth and other view infatuation."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "Pray, Master Gotama, is the world unlimited?<br/>
					Is this the truth and other view infatuation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have not declared, Uttiya:<br/>
					the world is unlimited<br/>
					this the truth and other view infatuation."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) "Pray, Master Gotama, is the soul body?<br/>
					Is this the truth and other view infatuation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have not declared, Uttiya:<br/>
					the soul is body<br/>
					this the truth and other view infatuation."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) "Pray, Master Gotama, is the soul one thing,<br/>
					body another thing?<br/>
					Is this the truth and other view infatuation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have not declared, Uttiya:<br/>
					the soul is one thing,<br/>
					body another thing<br/>
					this the truth and other view infatuation."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) "Pray, Master Gotama, is a wayfarer (man)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> beyond death?<br/>
					Is this the truth and other view infatuation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have not declared, Uttiya:<br/>
					a wayfarer (man) is beyond death<br/>
					this the truth and other view infatuation."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) "Pray, Master Gotama, is a wayfarer (man) not beyond death?<br/>
					Is this the truth and other view infatuation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have not declared, Uttiya:<br/>
					a wayfarer (man) is not beyond death<br/>
					this the truth and other view infatuation."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(9) "Pray, Master Gotama, is a wayfarer (man) beyond death<br/>
					and yet is not?<br/>
					Is this the truth and other view infatuation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have not declared, Uttiya:<br/>
					a wayfarer (man) is beyond death<br/>
					and yet is not<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">(10) "Pray, Master Gotama, is a wayfarer (man) neither beyond death<br/>

					<p class="f4">What then has been declared by the worthy Gotama?"</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"With full comprehension, Uttiya,<br/>
					I teach Dhamma to disciples<br/>
					for the purification of beings,<br/>
					for the overpassing of sorrow and despair,<br/>
					for the going to an end of grief and dejection,<br/>
					for reaching the Method,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					for the realizing of Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"If then with full comprehension<br/>
					the worthy Gotama teaches dhamma to disciples<br/>
					for the purification of beings,<br/>
					for the overpassing of sorrow and despair,<br/>
					for the going to an end of grief and dejection,<br/>
					for reaching the Method,<br/>
					for the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/>
					pray, will the whole world escape<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> thereby<br/>
					or only half of it<br/>
					or one third part of it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Exalted One was silent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span> Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Wanderer Uttiya must not be allowed to entertain the harmful view<br/>
					that:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Gotama the recluse,<br/>
					when asked by him an all-important question,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					let it drop.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Can it be that he cannot answer it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a view would be loss and sorrow<br/>
					for a long time<br/>
					to the Wanderer Uttiya."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"See now, Uttiya, your reverence,<br/>
					I will make a figure for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a figure sometimes intelligent people understand the meaning of what is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a border-town of some rājah,<br/>
					with strong foundations,<br/>
					strong walls and towers,<br/>
					but a single gate;<br/>
					and over that gate is set a warden,<br/>
					shrewd and watchful,<br/>
					who keeps out strangers<br/>
					and lets in known people.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he patrols all round that town in due order<br/>
					he might not mark a crevice in the wall<br/>
					or a hole big enough for a cat to slip through,<br/>
					nor would he have the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So many creatures enter<br/>
					or so many creatures leave this town.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But this he would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever creatures of any size<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					enter or leave this town,<br/>
					all of them enter or leave by this gate.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, your reverence<br/>
					(that question of yours, namely):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Will the whole world escape thereby<br/>
					or half of it<br/>
					or one third part of it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">is not a matter of urgent importance to the Wayfarer.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">What he says is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whosoever have escaped,<br/>
					are escaping<br/>
					or will escape from the world,<br/>
					all of them,<br/>
					by abandoning the five hindrances,<br/>
					those defilements of the heart<br/>
					which cause the weakening of insight -<br/>
					all of them<br/>
					with thoughts well established in the four arisings of mindfulness,<br/>
					by making to grow in very truth the seven limbs of wisdom -<br/>
					all of them have escaped,<br/>
					are escaping<br/>
					or will escape by so doing.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">So as to that question of yours which <span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span> you put to the Exalted One,<br/>
					you asked it from a different point of view.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the Exalted One did not explain the matter to you."</p>
