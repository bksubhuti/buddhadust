					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once on a time the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of ten<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> qualities a monk is worshipful,<br/>
					worthy of honour,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of being saluted with clasped hands,<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten qualities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is virtuous,<br/>
					he dwells restrained with the restraint of the obligation,<br/>
					well equipped in range of practice,<br/>
					seeing grounds for fear in minutest faults,<br/>
					he takes up and trains himself<br/>
					in the training of the precepts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again a monk has heard much;<br/>
					he bears in mind what he has heard,<br/>
					he stores up what he has heard.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[199]</span>Whatsoever teachings,<br/>
					lovely at the beginning,<br/>
					lovely midway,<br/>
					lovely at the end (of life),<br/>
					in spirit and in letter<br/>
					do stress the brahma-life<br/>
					in its all-round fullness<br/>
					and utter purity,<br/>
					such teachings are much heard by him,<br/>
					borne in mind,<br/>
					repeated aloud,<br/>
					pondered<br/>
					and well penetrated by vision.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again a monk has a friendship with the lovely,<br/>
					fellowship with the lovely,<br/>
					companionship with the lovely.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who has right view,<br/>
					he is possessed of right seeing.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he enjoys divers sorts of more-power:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many;</p>

					<p class="f4">manifest or invisible<br/>

					through a rampart,<br/>
					through a mountain,<br/>
					as if through air:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">he plunges into the earth<br/>
					and shoots up again<br/>
					as if in water;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">he walks upon the water<br/>
					without parting it,<br/>
					as if on solid ground;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">he travels through the air<br/>
					sitting cross-legged,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">even this moon and sun,<br/>
					though of such mighty power<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[138]</b></span> and majesty,<br/>
					he handles and strokes them<br/>
					with his hand;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">even as far as the Brahma-world<br/>
					he has power with his body.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">With the deva-power of hearing,<br/>
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br/>
					he can hear sound both of devas and of humans,<br/>
					whether far or near.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to know the minds of other beings,<br/>
					of other persons,<br/>
					with his own mind grasping them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is free from lust,<br/>
					he comes to know that it is free from lust.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is full of hate,<br/>

					he comes to know that it is free from delusion.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is cramped,<br/>
					he comes to know that it is cramped.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is diffuse,<br/>
					he comes to know that it is diffuse.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is lofty,<br/>
					he comes to know that it is lofty.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is mean,<br/>
					he comes to know that it is mean.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is inferior,<br/>
					he comes to know that it is inferior.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is superior,<br/>
					he comes to know that it is superior.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is in bondage,<br/>
					he comes to know that it is in bondage.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-◦-</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is released,<br/>
					he comes to know that it is is released.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls to mind his former dwelling in divers ways, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[200]</span>One birth,<br/>
					two births,<br/>
					three, four, five,<br/>
					even ten births,<br/>
					twenty, thirty, forty, fifty births;<br/>
					even a hundred births,<br/>
					a thousand, a hundred thousand births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise the divers folding up of aeons,<br/>
					the divers unfolding of aeons,<br/>
					the divers folding-unfolding of aeons.</p>

					<p class="f4">(remembering):</p>

					<p class="f4">'At that time I had such a name,<br/>
					was of such a family,<br/>
					of such complexion,<br/>
					was thus supported,<br/>
					thus and thus experienced weal and woe,<br/>
					had such and such span of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">As that one,<br/>
					I deceasing thence<br/>
					rose up again at that time;<br/>
					then too I had such a name,<br/>
					was of such a family,<br/>
					of such complexion,<br/>
					was thus supported,<br/>
					thus and thus experienced weal and woe,<br/>
					had such and such span of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">As that one,<br/>
					I deceasing thence rose up again here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with all details and characteristics<br/>
					he can recall his manifold dwellings aforetime.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, sir, the Exalted One with the deva-sight,<br/>
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br/>
					beholds beings deceasing<br/>
					and rising up again;<br/>
					beings both mean and excellent,<br/>
					fair and foul,<br/>
					gone to a happy born,<br/>
					gone to an ill-born<br/>
					according to their deeds<br/>
					(so as to say):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas, sirs, these beings,<br/>
					given to the practice of evil deeds,<br/>
					of evil words,<br/>
					of evil thoughts,<br/>
					scoffing at the Ariyans,<br/>
					of perverted view<br/>
					and reaping the fruits of their perverted view -<br/>
					these beings,<br/>
					when body broke up,<br/>
					beyond death rose up again in the Waste,<br/>
					the Ill-born,<br/>
					the Downfall,<br/>
					in Purgatory!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Ah, sirs, these beings,<br/>
					given to the practice of good deeds,<br/>
					of good words,<br/>
					of good thoughts,<br/>
					no scoffers at the Ariyans,<br/>
					but of <span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span> sound view<br/>
					and reaping the fruits of their sound view -<br/>
					these beings,<br/>

					in the heaven world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the deva-sight,<br/>

					gone to a happy born,<br/>
					gone to an ill-born<br/>
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the destruction of the cankers,<br/>
					in this same visible state<br/>
					he attains the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight<br/>
					that is freed of the cankers,<br/>
					himself thoroughly comprehending it,<br/>
					and realizing it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[201]</span> Possessed of these ten qualities<br/>
					a monk is worshipful,<br/>
					worthy of honour,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
