					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once on a time the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of ten qualities<br/>
					an elder monk, in whatever quarter he may live,<br/>
					lives happily.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">An elder monk has seen many a day pass,<br/>
					has long ago gone forth,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is virtuous,<br/>
					he dwells restrained<br/>
					with the restraint of the obligation,<br/>
					well equipped in range of practice,<br/>
					seeing grounds for fear in minutest faults,<br/>
					he takes up and trains himself<br/>
					in the training of the precepts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again he has heard much;<br/>
					he bears in mind what he has heard,<br/>
					he stores up what he has heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever teachings,<br/>
					lovely at the beginning,<br/>
					lovely midway,<br/>
					lovely at the end (of life),<br/>
					in spirit and in letter<br/>
					do stress the brahma-life<br/>
					in its all-round fullness<br/>
					and utter purity,<br/>
					such teachings are much heard by him,<br/>
					borne in mind,<br/>
					repeated aloud,<br/>
					pondered<br/>
					and well penetrated by vision.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover by him both of the obligations in full<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					are thoroughly learned by heart<br/>
					and well analysed,<br/>
					with full knowledge of the meaning,<br/>
					clearly divided sutta by sutta<br/>
					and in minute detail.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is skilled in the rise and settlement of disputes.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He delights in Dhamma,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					is pleasant to converse with,<br/>
					he rejoices exceedingly in further Dhamma<br/>
					and further discipline.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is content with whatsoever supply<br/>
					of robe and alms-food,<br/>
					of seat and lodging,<br/>
					of medicines and comforts in sickness<br/>
					he may get.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is charming<br/>
					and perfectly composed<br/>
					in his goings out<br/>
					and his comings in,<br/>
					and when he sits down in the house.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He wins at pleasure,<br/>
					without effort,<br/>
					without stint,<br/>
					the four stages of musing<br/>
					which are of the clear consciousness,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					which are concerned with the happy life<br/>
					in this same visible state.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">By destroying the cankers<br/>
					in this same visible state,<br/>
					thoroughly comprehending the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					he realizes,<br/>
					attains it<br/>
					and dwells therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">With these ten qualities<br/>
					an elder monk lives happily<br/>
					wherever he may be.</p>
