					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, in the southern districts<br/>
					there is an ablution.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion<br/>
					there are food and drink,<br/>
					food soft and hard,<br/>
					syrups and drinks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					dancing,<br/>
					singing<br/>
					and music of instruments.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, this is just a wiping,<br/>
					not a wiping out,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">For that ablution is low,<br/>
					common,<br/>
					vulgar,<br/>
					unariyan,<br/>
					not bringing profit;<br/>
					it conduces not to revulsion,<br/>
					to fading,<br/>
					to ending,<br/>
					to calming,<br/>
					to comprehension<br/>
					and illumination,<br/>
					it conduces not to nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I will teach you<br/>
					the Ariyan ablution,<br/>
					a washing which conduces to downright revulsion,<br/>
					fading,<br/>
					ending,<br/>
					calming,<br/>
					comprehension,<br/>
