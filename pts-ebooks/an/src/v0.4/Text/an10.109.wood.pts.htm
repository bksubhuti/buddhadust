					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, physicians administer an emetic<br/>
					for checking sickness arising from bile,<br/>
					phlegm,<br/>
					for checking sickness arising from wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is an emetic, monks, but not a wiping out,<br/>
					I declare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I will teach you the Ariyan emetic,<br/>
					an emetic which works and fails not;<br/>
					an emetic by which beings subject to rebirth<br/>
					are released from rebirth;<br/>
					whereby beings subject to decay<br/>
