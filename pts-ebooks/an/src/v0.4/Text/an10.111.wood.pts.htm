					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to<br/>
					him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and reminiscent talk<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, the words 'an adept, an adept,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> are used.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir, how far is a monk an adept?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this matter, monk, a monk is possessed<br/>
					of the right view of an adept,<br/>
					of an adept's right thinking,<br/>
					of an adept's right speech,<br/>
					of an adept's right action,<br/>
					of an adept's right living,<br/>
					of an adept's right effort,<br/>
					of an adept's right mindfulness,<br/>
					of an adept's right concentration,<br/>
					of an adept's right knowledge<br/>
					of an adept's right release.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far a monk is an adept."</p>

At <i>K.S.</i> ii, 84 <i>ff.,</i> it is possible to be one by insight and to declare gnosis without any super-powers. At <i>K.S.</i> v, 154, 265, the adept is such by cultivating the Arisings of Mindfulness; at <i>K.S.</i> v, 204, the Five controlling faculties. It is generally applied to defining the arahant, <i>K.S.</i> iii, 69. For an adept's virtues see <i>G.S.</i> i, 199. Thus the arahant is <i>asekha</i>, a master, not a pupil. In theosophical teachings the <i>asekha</i> is the next, but much higher stage than that of Arahant, and this is called 'the fifth initiation.'</p>
