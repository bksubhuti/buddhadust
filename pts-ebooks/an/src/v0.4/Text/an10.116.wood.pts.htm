					when reproached can know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We are reproached,'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One called to the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, do ye bear in mind<br/>
					the grounds for (being called) a sage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time for this, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Pay careful attention and I will speak."</p>
