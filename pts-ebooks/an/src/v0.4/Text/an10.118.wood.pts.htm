					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you the hither shore<br/>
					and the further shore.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen attentively.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your minds and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will, sir," replied those monks to the Exalted One, who said:</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is the hither shore<br/>
					and what is the further shore?</p>

					<p class="f4">Wrong view, monks, is the hither shore,<br/>
					right view the further shore.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Wrong thinking is the hither shore,<br/>
					right thinking the further shore.</p>

					right speech the further shore.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Few are they of mortal men<br/>
							Who have reached the further shore;<br/>
							But the crowd of other folk<br/>
							On this side fare up and down.<br/>
							When dhamma rightly is revealed,<br/>
							Who by dhamma fare along,<br/>
							They shall reach the shore and pass<br/>
							The realm of death so hard to cross.<br/>
							Giving up the state of darkness<br/>
							Let the wise pursue the light.<br/>
							Giving up home for the homeless,<br/>
							In solitude where joys are rare,<br/>
							Let him long for bliss unbounded.<br/>
							Leaving lusts and owning naught<br/>
							Let the wise man cleanse himself<br/>
							From the passions of the heart.<br/>
							They who in the limbs of wisdom<br/>
							Rightly make the mind to grow,<br/>
							Glad to have surrendered clinging,<br/>
							Glad to be from grasping free,<br/>
							Canker-cured they, all-resplendent<br/>
							I' the world are quenched utterly.'</p>
