					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					the day being the sabbath,<br/>
					having washed his head<br/>
					and put on a <span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span> fresh pair of linen cloths,<br/>
					holding a handful of wet <i>kusa</i> grass,<br/>
					was standing aside<br/>
					not far from the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One saw the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi<br/>
					this sabbath day,<br/>
					having washed his head<br/>
					and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br/>
					thus standing aside<br/>
					holding a handful of wet <i>kusa</i> grass,<br/>
					and on seeing him said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, brāhmin, that you<br/>
					on this sabbath day,<br/>
					having washed your head<br/>
					and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br/>
					thus stand aside<br/>
					holding a handful of wet <i>kusa</i> grass?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Today, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is the (ceremony of) descent<br/>
					of the brāhmin clan."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In what manner, brāhmin,<br/>
					is this descent?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, Master Gotama,<br/>
					it being the sabbath,<br/>
					brāhmins wash the head,<br/>
					put on a fresh pair of cloths,<br/>
					smear the floor with wet cowdung,<br/>
					strew it with wet <i>kusa</i> grass,<br/>
					and make their bed<br/>
					between the boundary<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> and the fire-house.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising up thrice in that night,<br/>
					with clasped hands<br/>
					they do homage to fire,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We come down<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> to your worship,<br/>
					we come down to your worship!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they feed the fire<br/>
					with oblation of oil<br/>
					of butter<br/>
					and fresh butter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">When the night has passed<br/>
					they feed brāhmins<br/>
					with choice food<br/>
					both hard and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is the descent of the brāhmins."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brāhmin, the descent (ceremony) of the brāhmins is one thing,<br/>
					the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan<br/>
					is quite another thing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Master Gotama,<br/>
					in what way is the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan done?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for me<br/>
					if the worthy Gotama would teach me dhamma<br/>
					as to the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, brāhmin, do you listen."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, master,"<br/>
					replied the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi to the Exalted One,<br/>

					<p class="f4">It is as if one should raise the fallen,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus has dhamma been expounded in divers ways by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, worthy Gotama,<br/>

					and to the order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Gotama reckon me as a lay-follower<br/>
