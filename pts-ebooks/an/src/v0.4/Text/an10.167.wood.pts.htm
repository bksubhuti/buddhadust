					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi,<br/>
					the day being the sabbath,<br/>
					having washed his head<br/>
					and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br/>
					holding a handful of wet <i>kusa</i> grass,<br/>
					was standing aside<br/>
					not far from the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One saw the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi<br/>
					this sabbath day,<br/>
					having washed his head<br/>
					and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br/>
					thus standing aside<br/>
					holding a handful of wet hum grass,<br/>
					and on seeing him said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, brāhmin, that you<br/>
					on this sabbath day,<br/>
					having washed your head<br/>
					and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br/>
					thus stand aside<br/>
					holding a handful of wet hum grass?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Today, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is the (ceremony of) descent<br/>
					of the brāhmin clan."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"In what manner, brāhmin,<br/>
					is this descent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, Master Gotama,<br/>
					it being the sabbath,<br/>
					brāhmins wash the head,<br/>
					put on a fresh pair of cloths,<br/>
					smear the floor with wet cowdung,<br/>
					strew it with wet kusa grass,<br/>
					and make their bed<br/>
					between the boundary and the fire-house.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising up thrice in that night,<br/>
					with clasped hands<br/>
					they do homage to fire,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We come down to your worship,<br/>
					we come down to your worship!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they feed the fire<br/>
					with oblation of oil<br/>
					of butter<br/>
					and fresh butter.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the night has passed<br/>
					they feed brāhmins<br/>
					with choice food<br/>
					both hard and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is the descent of the brāhmins."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brāhmin, the descent (ceremony) of the brāhmins is one thing,<br/>
					the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan<br/>
					is quite another thing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Master Gotama,<br/>
					in what way is the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan done?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for me<br/>
					if the worthy Gotama would teach me dhamma<br/>
					as to the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, brāhmin, do you listen."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, master,"<br/>
					replied the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to the Exalted One,<br/>
					who said:</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this matter, brāhmin, the Ariyan disciple thus ponders:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of the act of taking life<br/>
					the ripening is evil<br/>
					both in this same visible state<br/>
					and in that to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>
					he abandons taking life,<br/>
					he descends from taking life.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of taking what is not given<br/>
					the ripening is evil<br/>
					both in this same visible state<br/>
					and in that to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>
					he abandons taking what is not given,<br/>
					he descends from taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of wrong conduct in things sexual<br/>
					the ripening is evil<br/>
					both in this same visible state<br/>
					and in that to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>
					he abandons wrong conduct in things sexual,<br/>
					he descends from wrong conduct in things sexual.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of falsehood<br/>
					the ripening is evil<br/>
					both in this same visible state<br/>
					and in that to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>
					he abandons falsehood,<br/>
					he descends from falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of spiteful speech<br/>
					the ripening is evil<br/>
					both in this same visible state<br/>
					and in that to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>
					he abandons spiteful speech,<br/>
					he descends from spiteful speech.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of bitter speech<br/>
					the ripening is evil<br/>
					both in this same visible state<br/>
					and in that to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>
					he abandons bitter speech,<br/>
					he descends from bitter speech.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of idle babble<br/>
					the ripening is evil<br/>
					both in this same visible state<br/>
					and in that to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>
					he abandons idle babble,<br/>
					he descends from idle babble.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of coveting<br/>
					the ripening is evil<br/>
					both in this same visible state<br/>
					and in that to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>
					he abandons coveting,<br/>
					he descends from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of harmfulness<br/>
					the ripening is evil<br/>
					both in this same visible state<br/>
					and in that to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>
					he abandons harmfulness,<br/>
					he descends from harmfulness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of wrong view<br/>
					the ripening is evil,<br/>
					both in this same visible state<br/>
					and in the state to come.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>
					he abandons wrong view,<br/>
					he descends from wrong view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, brāhmin, is the descent<br/>
					by the discipline of the Ariyan."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, Master Gotama,<br/>
					one thing is the descent of the brāhmins,<br/>
					quite another thing is the descent<br/>
					by the discipline of the Ariyan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, Master Gotama,<br/>
					compared with the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan<br/>
					that of the brāhmins is not worth one sixteenth part of it.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span> It is excellent, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if one should raise the fallen,<br/>
					open up the hidden,<br/>
					point out the way<br/>
					to one gone astray,<br/>
					hold up a shining light<br/>
					so that they who have eyes<br/>
					may see objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus has dhamma been expounded in divers ways by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, worthy Gotama,<br/>
					do go for resort to the awakened one,<br/>
					to dhamma<br/>
					and to the order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Gotama reckon me as a lay-follower<br/>
					from this day forth,<br/>
					so long as life shall last,<br/>
					as one who has gone to him as resort."</p>
