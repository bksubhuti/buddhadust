							Who have reached the further shore;<br/>
							But the crowd of other folk<br/>
							On this side fare up and down.<br/>
							When dhamma rightly is revealed,<br/>
							Who by dhamma fare along,<br/>
							They shall reach the shore and pass<br/>
							The realm of death so hard to cross.<br/>
							Giving up the state of darkness<br/>
							Let the wise pursue the light.<br/>
							Giving up home for the homeless,<br/>
							In solitude where joys are rare,<br/>
							Let him long for bliss unbounded.<br/>
							Leaving lusts and owning naught<br/>
							Let the wise man cleanse himself<br/>
							From the passions of the heart.<br/>
							They who in the limbs of wisdom<br/>
							Rightly make the mind to grow,<br/>
							Glad to have surrendered clinging,<br/>
							Glad to be from grasping free,<br/>
							Canker-cured they, all-resplendent<br/>
							I' the world are quenched utterly.</p>
