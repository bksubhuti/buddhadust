					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously, and,<br/>
					after the exchange of greetings and reminiscent talk,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, let me tell you we brāhmins so-called<br/>
					give charitable gifts:<br/>
					we make the <i>(shrāddhā)</i> offerings to the dead,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May this gift to our kinsmen<br/>
					and blood-relations who are dead and gone<br/>
					be of profit.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">May our kinsmen<br/>
					and blood-relations who are dead and gone<br/>
					enjoy this offering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, Master Gotama,<br/>
					does that gift profit <span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span> our kinsmen<br/>
					and blood-relations dead and gone?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do they really enjoy that gift?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, brāhmin,<br/>
					if there be ground for it,<br/>
					it does profit them,<br/>
					but not if there be no ground."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Master Gotama, what is ground,<br/>
					and what is no-ground?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, brāhmin,<br/>
					a certain one takes life,<br/>
					takes what is not given,<br/>
					in sexual desires is a wrongdoer,<br/>
					is a slanderer,<br/>
					of bitter speech,<br/>
					an idle babbler,<br/>
					covetous,<br/>
					harmful in thought<br/>
					and wrong in view.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up,<br/>
					beyond death<br/>
					he rises up again in a purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he subsists on food<br/>
					proper to dwellers in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that he is grounded.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brāhmin, is the no-ground,<br/>
					standing on which that gift profits him not.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again a certain one takes life,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He, when body breaks up,<br/>

					rises up again in the womb of an animal.</p>

					<p class="f4">There also he subsists on food<br/>
					proper to creatures so born.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that he is grounded.</p>

					<p class="f4">This also, brāhmin, is no-ground,<br/>
					whereon standing that gift profits him not.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again a certain one abstains from taking life,<br/>
					from taking what is not given,<br/>
					from wrong conduct in sexual desires,<br/>
					from falsehood,<br/>
					from slander,<br/>
					from bitter speech,<br/>
					from idle babble;<br/>

					on that he is grounded.</p>

					<p class="f4">This indeed, brāhmin, is the ground,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Master Gotama, suppose that this blood-relation<br/>
					who is dead and gone<br/>
					has not reached that place,<br/>
					who then enjoys that offering?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, brāhmin,<br/>

					enjoy it."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"But suppose, Master Gotama,<br/>
					that both that blood-relation<br/>
					and the others who are dead and gone<br/>

					<p class="f4">"That, brāhmin, is impossible,<br/>
					it cannot come to pass<br/>
					that that place should be empty<br/>

					of blood-relations dead and gone.</p>

					<p class="f4">Anyhow, brāhmin,<br/>
