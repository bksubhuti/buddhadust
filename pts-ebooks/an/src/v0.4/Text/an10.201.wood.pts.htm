					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

						

					<p class="f4">"Monks, characterized by ten qualities<br/>
					one is cast into purgatory according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one takes life,<br/>
					he is a hunter,<br/>
					bloody-handed,<br/>
					given up to killing and slaying,<br/>
					void of compassion for all living creatures.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">A certain one takes what is not given;<br/>
					he takes with thievish intent<br/>
					things not given to him,<br/>
					the property of another person,<br/>
					situated in jungle<br/>
					or in village.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In sexual desires<br/>
					he is a wrong-doer;<br/>
					he has intercourse with girls in ward of mother or father,<br/>
					brother,<br/>
					sister<br/>
					or relatives (or clan);<br/>
					with girls lawfully guarded,<br/>
					already pledged to a husband<br/>
					and protected by the rod,<br/>
					even with girls crowned with the flower-garland (of betrothal).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a liar.</p>

					<p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br/>
					or a company<br/>
					or amid his relatives<br/>
					or guild-men<br/>
					or before the royal family<br/>
					and asked to bear witness<br/>
					with the words:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good fellow!<br/>
					Say what you know.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he knows not, he says, 'I know';<br/>
					though he knows, he says, 'I know not';<br/>
					though he has not seen, he says 'I saw';<br/>
					though he saw, he says 'I saw not'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for his own sake<br/>
					or that of others<br/>
					or to get some carnal profit or other<br/>
					he deliberately utters falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is a slanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing something at one place<br/>
					he proclaims it somewhere else<br/>
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br/>
					what he has heard here<br/>
					he repeats there<br/>
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he breaks up harmony,<br/>
					foments strife between those discordant,<br/>
					discord is his delight;<br/>
					exulting in<br/>
					and passionately fond of discord,<br/>
					he utters speech<br/>
					that makes for discord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is of harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is rough,<br/>
					cutting,<br/>
					bitter about others,<br/>
					abusive of others,<br/>
					provoking wrath<br/>
					and conducive to distraction -<br/>
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is given to idle babble,<br/>
					he speaks out of season,<br/>
					speaks unrealities;<br/>
					he speaks things unprofitable,<br/>
					what is not-dhamma<br/>
					and not-discipline;<br/>
					he utters speech not worth treasuring up,<br/>
					speech unreasonable<br/>
					and not worth listening to,<br/>
					undiscriminating<br/>
					and unconcerned with profit.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is covetous,<br/>
					he is one who covets the property of another,<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'O that what is another's were mine!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is malevolent of heart,<br/>
					the thoughts of his heart are corrupt, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let these beings be slain,<br/>
					come to destruction,<br/>
					be destroyed,<br/>
					not exist at all.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he has wrong view,<br/>
					he is perverse in outlook,<br/>
					holding:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no gift,<br/>
					no offering,<br/>
					no sacrifice;<br/>
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds<br/>
					well done or ill done;<br/>
					this world is not,<br/>
					the world beyond is not;<br/>
					there is no mother,<br/>
					no father,<br/>
					no beings supernaturally born;<br/>
					there are no recluses and brāhmins in the world<br/>
					who have gone right,<br/>
					who fare rightly,<br/>
					men who by their own comprehension<br/>
					have realized this world<br/>
					and the world beyond<br/>
					and thus declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Characterized by these ten qualities<br/>
					one is cast into purgatory according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Characterized by ten qualities, monks,<br/>
					one is put into heaven according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one abandons taking life,<br/>
					abstains therefrom;<br/>
					he has laid aside the rod,<br/>
					has laid aside the knife;<br/>
					he dwells modest,<br/>
					charitable,<br/>
					feeling compassion towards every living creature.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He abandons taking what is not given,<br/>
					abstains therefrom;<br/>
					the property of another,<br/>
					situated in jungle or in village,<br/>
					if not given,<br/>
					he takes not with thievish intent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In sexual desires<br/>
					he abandons wrong action,<br/>
					abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has no intercourse<br/>

					and protected by the rod,<br/>
					even with girls crowned<br/>
					with the flower-garlands (of betrothal).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He abandons lying speech<br/>
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br/>

					thus he brings together the discordant,<br/>
					restores harmony,<br/>
					harmony is his delight,<br/>
					he exults in,<br/>
					is passionately fond of harmony;<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is blameless,<br/>
					pleasant to the ear,<br/>
					affectionate,<br/>
					going to the heart,<br/>
					urbane,<br/>
					agreeable to many folk,<br/>
					delightful to many folk,<br/>
					of such speech he is a speaker.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also abandoning idle babble<br/>
					he abstains therefrom;<br/>
					he speaks in season,<br/>
					of facts,<br/>
					of the aim,<br/>
					of dhamma,<br/>
					of discipline;<br/>
					he utters speech worth treasuring up,<br/>
					speech seasonable<br/>

					and concerned with the aim.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not covetous;<br/>
