					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

						

					<p class="f4">"Monks, characterized by ten qualities<br/>
					women lay-followers are cast into purgatory according to their deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one takes life,<br/>

					she is of harsh speech,<br/>
					she is given to idle babble,<br/>
					she is covetous,<br/>
					she is malevolent of heart,<br/>
					she has wrong view.</p>
