					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In sensual desires<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one is a liar.</p>

					<p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br/>

					<p class="f4">though he knows not,<br/>

					though he knows, he says 'I know not';<br/>
					though he saw not,<br/>
					he says he saw;<br/>
					though he saw,<br/>
					he denies it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for his own sake<br/>
					or that of others<br/>
					or to get some carnal profit or other<br/>
					he deliberately utters falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is a slanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing something at one place<br/>
					he proclaims it at another place<br/>
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">What he has heard here<br/>
					he repeats there<br/>
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he breaks up harmony<br/>
					and foments strife<br/>
					between those discordant;<br/>
					discord is his delight;<br/>
					exulting in discord,<br/>
					passionately fond of discord<br/>
					he utters speech that makes for discord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is harsh of speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is rough,<br/>
					cutting,<br/>
					bitter about others,<br/>
					abusive of others,<br/>
					provoking wrath<br/>
					and conducive to distraction -<br/>
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is given to idle babble,<br/>
					he speaks out of season,<br/>
					speaks unrealities,<br/>
					he speaks unprofitable things,<br/>
					speaks what is not-dhamma,<br/>
					what is not-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters words not worth treasuring up,<br/>
					words unseasonable<br/>
					and not worth listening to,<br/>
					undiscriminating<br/>
					and not concerned with the aim.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, fourfold is the fault and guilt<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is the fault and guilt<br/>
					of action by mind,<br/>
					done with deliberate intent,<br/>
					causing pain<br/>
					and resulting in pain<br/>
					of a threefold nature?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one is covetous,<br/>
					he is one who covets <span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span> the property of another, thinking;</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 that what is another's were mine!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He is malevolent of heart,<br/>
					the thoughts of his heart are corrupt, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let these beings be slain,<br/>
					come to destruction,<br/>
					be destroyed,<br/>
					let them not exist at all.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise he has wrong view,<br/>
					he is perverse in outlook, holding:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no gift,<br/>
					no offering,<br/>
					no sacrifice;<br/>
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds<br/>
					ill done or well done;<br/>
					this world is not;<br/>
					the world beyond is not;<br/>
					there is no mother or father<br/>
					or beings born by supernatural birth (in another state);<br/>
					there are no recluses and brahmins in the world<br/>
					who have gone right,<br/>
					who fare aright,<br/>
					men who by their own comprehension<br/>
					have realized this world<br/>
					and the world beyond<br/>
					and so declare it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, threefold is the fault and guilt<br/>
