					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><i>[4]</i></span> Monks, for one who is concentrated<br/>
					there is no need for the thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'I know and see things as they really are.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It follows naturally<br/>

					<p class="f4">'I realize release by knowing and seeing.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It follows naturally<br/>
					that he in whose interest has faded<br/>
					realizes release by knowing and seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So you see, monks,<br/>
					revulsion has fading of interest<br/>
					as object and profit;<br/>
					fading of interest has release by knowing and seeing<br/>
					as object and profit;<br/>
					seeing and knowing (things) as they really are,<br/>
					has fading interest<br/>
					as object and profit;<br/>
					concentration has knowing and seeing things as they really are<br/>
					as object and profit;<br/>
					happiness has concentration<br/>
					as object and profit;<br/>
					calm has happiness;<br/>
					rapture has calm;<br/>
					joy has rapture;<br/>
					freedom from remorse has joy;<br/>
					good conduct has freedom from remorse<br/>
					as its object,<br/>
					freedom from remorse as its profit.</p>
