					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					having thanked the Exalted One for what he had said,<br/>
					rose up from his seat,<br/>
					saluted him by keeping his right side towards him,<br/>
					and went to see the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					whom he greeted courteously, and,<br/>
					after the exchange of greetings and reminiscent talk,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So seated he said this to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[320]</span> "Pray, your reverence, may it be<br/>
					that a monk's winning of concentration<br/>
					may be of such a sort<br/>
					that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>
					in water unaware of water,<br/>
					in fire unaware of fire,<br/>
					in air unaware of it,<br/>
					in the realm of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>

					that whatsoever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br/>

					and yet is conscious?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"It may be so, Ānanda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A monk's winning of concentration<br/>

					<p class="f4">"But, sir, in what way<br/>

					<p class="f4"> 'Herein, Ānanda, a monk is conscious thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This is the real,<br/>
					this is the best, namely,<br/>
					the calming of all activities,<br/>

					<p class="f4">In such a way, Ānanda,<br/>
