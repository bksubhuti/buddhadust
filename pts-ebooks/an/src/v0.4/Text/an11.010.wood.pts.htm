					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[323]</span> Once the Exalted One was staying at Natika<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in the Brick Hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sandha came to see the Exalted One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span> "Sandha, do you muse with the musing<br/>

					<p class="f4">Muse not with the musing<br/>

					<p class="f4">And what is the musing<br/>
					of the unbroken colt?</p>

					<p class="f4">The unbroken colt, Sandha,<br/>
					when tied up by the feeding-trough muses:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Fodder! Fodder!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">When thus tied up by the feeding-trough<br/>

					<p class="f4">'I wonder what task the trainer will set me today?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What can I do for him in return?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But tied up there by the feeding-trough<br/>
					he just muses of fodder.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Sandha,<br/>
					a certain one here,<br/>
					an untrained man-colt,<br/>
					who has gone to the forest<br/>
					or the root of a tree<br/>
					or a lonely dwelling-place,<br/>
					lives with a heart obsessed by desire and lust,<br/>
					overwhelmed by desire and lust,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Keeping desire and lust within him<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">Keeping sloth-and-torpor within him<br/>
					he muses,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He lives with a heart obsessed by worry-and-flurry,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Keeping worry-and-flurry within him<br/>

					<p class="f4">He lives with a heart obsessed by doubt-and-wavering,<br/>
					overwhelmed by doubt-and-wavering,<br/>
					and he has not come to know<br/>
					the way out of doubt-and-wavering when it arises.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Keeping doubt-and-wavering within him<br/>

					<p class="f4">He muses not on fodder always<br/>

					<p class="f4">The goodly, trained thoroughbred, Sandha,<br/>
