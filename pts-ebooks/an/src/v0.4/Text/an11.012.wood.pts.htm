					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br/>
					at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					a number of monks were busy<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For," said they, "when the rains are over<br/>
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> heard it said<br/>
					that a number of monks were busy<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br/>
					and that when the rains were over<br/>
					the Exalted One would set forth on his rounds,<br/>
					so he went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.<br/>
					So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard it said, sir,<br/>
					that a number of monks are busy<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br/>
					and that when the rains are over<br/>
					the Exalted One will set forth on his rounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir, among those who live in various ways,<br/>
					in whose way of living should we live?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[329]</span> "Well asked, Mahānāma!<br/>
					Well asked, Mahānāma!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a fit thing for you clansmen<br/>
					to come to see the Wayfarer<br/>
					and ask such a question.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> Mahānāma,<br/>
					is a believer, not an unbeliever.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					is of ardent energy, no sluggard.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					has mindfulness fixed, not distracted.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					is composed, not discomposed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					is strong in insight, not weak in insight.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have established yourself<br/>
					in these five qualities, Mahānāma,<br/>
					you should further make six qualities to grow.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this matter, Mahānāma,<br/>
					you should recollect the Wayfarer thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span> 'The Exalted One is an arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Well-farer, a world-knower,<br/>
					an unsurpassed trainer of men to be trained,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					an awakened one,<br/>
					Exalted One is he.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br/>
					as the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					thus calls to mind the Wayfarer,<br/>
					at that time his heart<br/>
					is not obsessed by lust,<br/>
					not obsessed by malice,<br/>
					not obsessed by delusion;<br/>
					at such time his heart<br/>
					is firmly fixed on the Wayfarer;<br/>
					with upright heart the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					wins the joyful thrill of the weal,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					wins the joyful thrill of Dhamma,<br/>
					wins the joyful thrill<br/>
					of joy that goes with Dhamma;<br/>
					in one so joyous is born zest;<br/>
					in one of zestful mind<br/>
					the body is calmed;<br/>
					he whose body is calmed<br/>
					experiences happiness;<br/>
					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, Mahānāma, is thus spoken of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple dwells evenly<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					'mid folk who are at strife;<br/>
					void of malice he dwells<br/>
					'mid folk who are malevolent;<br/>
					blessed with the ear of Dhamma<br/>
					he makes recollection of the Awakened One to grow.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Mahānāma,<br/>
					you should recollect Dhamma thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma<br/>
					that is of this visible life,<br/>
					unhindered by time,<br/>
					that bids one come to see it,<br/>
					that leads onward,<br/>
					to be understood by the discerning,<br/>
					each for himself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br/>
					as the Ariyan disciple recollects Dhamma,<br/>
					at that time his heart<br/>
					is not obsessed <span class="f2">[330]</span> by lust, malice, delusion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At such time<br/>
					his upright heart is fixed on Dhamma;<br/>
					upright in heart the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					wins the joyful thrill of the weal,<br/>
					wins the joyful thrill of Dhamma,<br/>
					wins the joyful thrill<br/>
					of the joy that goes with Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br/>
					in one of zestful mind<br/>
					the body is calmed;<br/>
					he whose body is calmed<br/>
					experiences happiness;<br/>
					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, Mahānāma,<br/>
					is thus spoken of:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple dwells evenly<br/>
					'mid folk who are at strife;<br/>
					void of malice he dwells<br/>
					'mid folk who are malevolent;<br/>
					blessed with the ear of Dhamma<br/>
					he makes recollection of the Awakened One to grow.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span> Then again, Mahānāma,<br/>
					you should recollect the Order thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well-faring on the way<br/>
					is the Order of disciples of the Exalted One,<br/>
					straightforward-faring on the way<br/>
					is the Order of disciples of the Exalted One,<br/>
					faring on in the Method<br/>
					is the Order of disciples of the Exalted One,<br/>
					dutifully faring onward<br/>
					is the Order of disciples of the Exalted One, namely:</p>

					<p class="f4">The four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight persons who are males.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the Exalted One's Order of disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands are they,<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br/>
					as the Ariyan disciple recollects the Order,<br/>
					at that time<br/>
					his heart is not obsessed by lust, malice and delusion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His heart is upright,<br/>
					is firmly fixed on the Order;<br/>
					with heart thus upright<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					wins the joyful thrill of the weal,<br/>
					wins the joyful thrill of Dhamma,<br/>
					of the joy that goes with Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br/>
					in one of zestful mind<br/>
					the body is calmed;<br/>
					he whose body is calmed<br/>

					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, Mahānāma,<br/>
					is thus spoken of:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple dwells evenly<br/>
					'mid folk who are at strife;<br/>
					void of malice he dwells<br/>
					'mid folk who are malevolent;<br/>
					blessed with the ear of Dhamma<br/>
					he makes recollection of the Order to grow.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Mahānāma,<br/>
					you should recollect your own virtues<br/>
					as being unbroken, whole, unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished, giving freedom,<br/>
					as praised by the discerning ones,<br/>
					virtues untainted,<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br/>
					as the Ariyan disciple recollects his virtues,<br/>
					at that time<br/>
					his heart is not obsessed by lust, malice and delusion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At such a time his heart is upright,<br/>
					firmly fixed on virtue.<br/>
					With heart thus upright<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple wins<br/>
					the joyful thrill of the weal,<br/>
					of Dhamma,<br/>
					of the joy that goes with Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br/>
					in one of zestful mind<br/>
					the body is calmed;<br/>
					he whose body is calmed experiences happiness;<br/>
					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, Mahānāma,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[331]</span> Then again, Mahānāma,<br/>
					you should recollect your own liberality, thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'A gain, indeed, it is to me,<br/>
					well gained it is by me<br/>
					that, amid folk o'ergrown with the blight of stinginess,<br/>
					I live at home<br/>
					with heart cleansed<br/>
					of the blight of stinginess,<br/>
					open-handed, pure-handed,<br/>
					delighting in self-surrender,<br/>
					one to ask a favour of,<br/>
					one who rejoices in dispensing charitable <span class="f3"><i>[212]</i></span>gifts.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br/>
					as the Ariyan disciple recollects liberality,<br/>
					at that time<br/>
					his heart is not obsessed by lust, malice and delusion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His heart is upright,<br/>

					with heart thus upright<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple wins<br/>

					of the joy that goes with Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br/>

					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, Mahānāma,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple dwells evenly<br/>
					'mid folk who are at strife,<br/>

					'mid folk who are malevolent,<br/>

					he makes recollection of liberality to grow.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Mahānāma, you should recollect the devas, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are the devas of the Four Great Kings,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
					those of the suite of the Thirty-three,<br/>
					the devas of Yama,<br/>
					the devas of delight,<br/>
					the devas who delight in creation,<br/>
					those who have power over the creations of others,<br/>

					the devas beyond that.</p>

					<p class="f4">In me too is seen<br/>

					that sort of liberality,<br/>
					that sort of insight,<br/>
					blessed with which<br/>

					and rose up again there.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br/>
					as the Ariyan disciple recollects the faith,<br/>
					virtue, learning,<br/>
					liberality and insight<br/>
					both of himself and of those devas,<br/>
					at that time his heart<br/>
					is not obsessed by lust, malice and delusion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At that time<br/>
					his heart is upright,<br/>
					fixed upon the devas.<br/>
					With upright heart<br/>

					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br/>

					<p class="f4">This one, Mahānāma,<br/>
