					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br/>
					at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that <span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span> occasion<br/>
					the Exalted One was desirous<br/>
					of taking up residence<br/>
					during the rainy season<br/>
					at Sāvatthī.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And Nandiya the Sakyan heard it said<br/>
					that the Exalted One so desired.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[335]</span> Then it occurred to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Suppose I also were to take up residence<br/>
					at Sāvatthī during the rainy season.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then I could both apply myself<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to my business<br/>
					and at the same time<br/>
					get a chance of seeing the Exalted One<br/>
					from time to time."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One took up residence at Sāvatthī<br/>
					during the rainy season<br/>
					and Nandiya the Sakyan did the same.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There he applied himself to his business<br/>
					and from time to time<br/>
					got a chance of seeing the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>
					a number of monks were busy<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"For," said they, "when the rains are over<br/>
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds."</p>

					<p class="f4">And Nandiya the Sakyan heard it said<br/>
					that a number of monks were busy<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br/>
					and that when the rains were over<br/>
					the Exalted One would set forth on his rounds,<br/>
					so he went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard it said, sir,<br/>
					that a number of monks are busy<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br/>
					and that when the rains are over<br/>
					the Exalted One will set forth on his rounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir, among those who live in various ways,<br/>
					in whose way of living should we live?"</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well asked, Nandiya!<br/>
					Well asked, Nandiya!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a fit thing for you clansmen<br/>
					to come to see the Wayfarer<br/>
					and ask such a question.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business, Nandiya,<br/>
					is a believer, not an unbeliever.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business is virtuous, not immora1.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					is of ardent energy, no sluggard.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					has mindfulness fixed, not distracted.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					is composed, not discomposed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br/>
					is strong in insight, not weak in insight.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have established yourself<br/>
					in these six qualities, Nandiya,<br/>
					you should set up mindfulness<br/>
					in the inner self<br/>
					in five<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Nandiya, you should recollect the Wayfarer thus: <span class="f2">[336]</span></p>

					<p class="f4">'The Exalted One is an arahant,<br/>
					fully enlightened,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Well-farer, a world-knower,<br/>
					an unsurpassed trainer of men to be trained,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					an awakened one,<br/>
					Exalted One is he.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on the Wayfarer<br/>
					you should set up mindfulness<br/>
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect Dhamma thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well <span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span> declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma<br/>
					that is of this visible life,<br/>
					unhindered by time,<br/>
					that bids one come to see it,<br/>
					that leads onward,<br/>
					to be understood by the discerning,<br/>
					each for himself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on Dhamma<br/>
					you should set up mindfulness<br/>
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect lovely friends thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A gain to me it is indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well gotten indeed by me it is,<br/>
					that I have lovely friends,<br/>
					compassionate,||<br/>
					desirous of my welfare,<br/>
					who encourage and exhort me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on lovely friends<br/>
					you should set up mindfulness<br/>
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect your own liberality thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A gain it is to me indeed!<br/>
					Well gotten indeed it is by me,<br/>
					that amid folk overgrown<br/>
					with the blight of stinginess<br/>
					I live at home cleansed<br/>
					of the blight of stinginess,<br/>
					open-handed, pure-handed,<br/>
					delighting in self-surrender,<br/>
					one to ask a favour of,<br/>
					rejoicing in dispensing charitable gifts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on liberality<br/>
					you should set up mindfulness<br/>
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, Nandiya, you should recollect the devas thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever devas,<br/>
					passing beyond the company of those devas<br/>
					who subsist on food material,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					do rise up again in a certain mind-made body<br/>
					— such devas observe in the self<br/>
					nothing more to do,<br/>
					no need for repeating what is done.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Nandiya,<br/>
					a monk who is definitely released<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					observes in the self no more to do,<br/>
					observes no need for repeating <span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span> what is done,<br/>
					even so, Nandiya,<br/>
					whatsoever devas,<br/>
					passing beyond the company of those devas<br/>
					who subsist on food material,<br/>
					do rise up again in a certain mind-made body,<br/>
					— such devas observe in the self<br/>
					nothing more to do,<br/>
					no need for repeating what is done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, fixed upon the devas<br/>
					you should cause mindfulness to arise<br/>
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Nandiya,<br/>
					possessing these eleven qualities<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					just abandons evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					he clings not to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Nandiya,<br/>
					a pot upset<br/>
					pours out its water<br/>
					and cannot take it in again;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					or just as fire<br/>
					let loose in a dry grass-jungle<br/>
					goes blazing on<br/>
					and turns not back to what is burnt out,<br/>
					even so, Nandiya,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					possessed of these eleven qualities<br/>
					just abandons evil, unprofitable states<br/>
					and clings not to them."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>
