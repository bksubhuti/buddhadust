					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Subhūti<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					came along with a believing monk<br/>
					to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>
					the Exalted One said this to the venerable Subhūti:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray who is this monk, Subhūti?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is a believer, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is the son of a believing disciple<br/>
					and went forth from a believer's home<br/>
					to the homeless."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Subhūti, does this believing monk,<br/>
					the son of a believing disciple<br/>
					who went forth from a believer's home<br/>
					to the homeless<br/>
					— does he conform<br/>
					to the traditional marks of the believer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time for this, 0 Exalted One!<br/>
					Now is the time for this, 0 Well-farer,<br/>
					for the Exalted One to tell<br/>
					the traditional marks of belief in a believer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I shall understand<br/>
					whether this monk does conform<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					to the traditional marks or not."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span> "Then, Subhūti, do you listen.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Pay attention carefully<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, sir,"<br/>
					replied the venerable Subhūti<br/>
					to the Exalted One, who said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[338]</span> 'In this connexion, Subhūti,<br/>
					a monk is virtuous,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

					well equipped with range of practice,<br/>
					seeing danger in minutest faults,<br/>

					applies himself thereto.</p>

					pondered and well penetrated by vision.</p>
