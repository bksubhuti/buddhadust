					<p class="f4">Monks, eleven advantages are to be looked for<br/>
					from the release of heart<br/>
					by the practice of amity,<br/>
					by making amity to grow,<br/>
					by making much of it,<br/>
					by making amity a vehicle and basis,<br/>
					by persisting in it,<br/>
					by becoming familiar with it,<br/>
					by well establishing it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are the eleven?</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[1]</b> One sleeps happy<br/>
					<b>[2]</b> and wakes happy;<br/>
					<b>[3]</b> he sees no evil dream;<br/>
					<b>[4]</b> he is dear to human beings<br/>
					<b>[5]</b> and non-human beings alike;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					<b>[6]</b> the devas guard him;<br/>
					<b>[7]</b> fire, poison or sword affect him not;<br/>
					<b>[8]</b> quickly he concentrates his mind;<br/>
					<b>[9]</b> his complexion is serene;<br/>
					<b>[10]</b> he makes an end without bewilderment;<br/>
					<b>[11]</b> and if he has penetrated no further (to Arahantship)<br/>
					he reaches (at death) the Brahma-worId.</p>

					<p class="f4">These eleven advantages<br/>
					are to be looked for<br/>
					from the release of the heart<br/>
