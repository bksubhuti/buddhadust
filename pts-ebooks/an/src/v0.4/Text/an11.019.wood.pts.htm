					<p class="f4">Now many Monks went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So seated they said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray sir, may it be<br/>
					that a monk's winning of concentration<br/>
					is of such a sort<br/>
					that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>
					in water unaware of water,<br/>
					in heat unaware of heat,<br/>
					in air unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>
					that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>
					in the world beyond unaware of it,<br/>
					in whatsoever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br/>
					attained, searched into, pondered over by mind<br/>
					unaware of the seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br/>
					attained, searched into, pondered over by mind<br/>
					and yet at the same time does perceive?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"It may be so, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk's winning of concentration may be of such a sort<br/>
					that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>
					in water unaware of water,<br/>
					in heat unaware of heat,<br/>
					in air unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>

					and yet at the same time he may perceive."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, sir, in what way<br/>
					may a monk's winning of concentration<br/>
					be of such a sort<br/>
					that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>
					in water unaware of water,<br/>
					in heat unaware of heat,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, Monks, a monk has this perception:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This is the real,<br/>
					this is the best, namely,<br/>
					the calming of all activities,<br/>
					the rejection of all substrate,<br/>
					the ending of craving,<br/>
					the fading of interest, stopping, Nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a way, Monks, a monk's winning of concentration may be of such a sort<br/>
