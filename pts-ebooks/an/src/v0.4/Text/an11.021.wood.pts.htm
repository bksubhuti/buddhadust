					<p class="f4">Now a number of monks went to see the venerable Sāriputta, and on coming to him greeted him courteously and sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sitting to one side those monks addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"May it be, venerable Sāriputta, that a monk's winning of concentration is of such a sort that<br/>

					in air unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>
					that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>
					in the world beyond unaware of it,<br/>
					in whatsoever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br/>
					attained, searched into, pondered over by mind<br/>
					unaware of the seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br/>
					attained, searched into, pondered over by mind<br/>
					and yet at the same time he may be aware?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It may be the case, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, monks, a monk is conscious thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This is the real,<br/>
