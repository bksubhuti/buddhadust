					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta, addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"May it be the case, monks,<br/>
					that a monk's winning of concentration is of such a sort that<br/>
					in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>
					in water unaware of water,<br/>
					in heat unaware of heat,<br/>
					in air unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>
					in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>
					that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>
					in the world beyond unaware of it,<br/>
					in whatsoever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br/>
					attained, searched into, pondered over by mind<br/>
					unaware of the seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br/>
					attained, searched into, pondered over by mind<br/>
					and yet at the same time he may be aware?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">"We would come a long way, your reverence,<br/>
					to learn the meaning of this saying<br/>
					from the venerable Sāriputta.<br/>
					Well for us, sir, if the meaning of this saying<br/>
					were to occur to the venerable Sāriputta.<br/>
					Hearing it from the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					the monks would bear it in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, monks, a monk is conscious thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This is the real,<br/>

					<p class="f4">In such a way a monk's winning of concentration<br/>
