					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk in residence follow the course of five things,<br/>
					he becomes of great service to his residence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">He becomes virtuous,<br/>
					abides restrained by the restraint of the Obligations,<br/>
					is perfect in conduct and habit,<br/>
					sees peril in the smallest fault,<br/>
					accepts the training<br/>
					and trains himself accordantly;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he is learned,<br/>
					with mind retentive and well stored;<br/>
					those things lovely in the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle,<br/>
					lovely in the end,<br/>
					which set forth in spirit and in letter<br/>
					the godly life of purity,<br/>
					perfect in its entirety —<br/>
					those are fully learnt by him,<br/>
					resolved upon,<br/>
					made familiar by speech,<br/>
					pondered over in the mind,<br/>
					fully understood in theory;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he has a pleasant voice,<br/>
					a good enunciation,<br/>
					is urbane in speech,<br/>
					distinct,<br/>
					free from hoarseness<br/>
					and informative;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">he repairs things broken and dilapidated;<br/>
					and when many monks of the Order have come,<br/>
					monks from various parts of the country,<br/>
					he speaks to the householders who approach,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"See, good sirs,<br/>
					many monks from various parts of the country have arrived;<br/>
					do good;<br/>
					now is the time to make merit!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">At will,<br/>
					easily and without trouble,<br/>
					he attains to the four states of musing,<br/>
					which bring comfort<br/>
					both here and now,<br/>
					transcending thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, if a monk in residence follow the course of five things,<br/>
					he becomes of great service to his residence.</p>
