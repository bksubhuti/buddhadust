    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n107" href="#fn107">107</a></sup> For their story <i>Cf.</i> <i>UdA.</i> 54. <i>Comy.</i> spells Tapassa-Bhallika; Burmese MSS. Taphusso, Tapussa. At <i>A.</i> iv, 438, Tapussa.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n108" href="#fn108">108</a></sup> 'Feeder of the destitute.' <i>Cf. Vin.</i> ii, 6, 4; <i>Vin. Texts,</i> iii, 179; <i>S.</i> i, 211. His story is well known. He bought Jeta Grove at the price of its own surface covered with gold pieces from Prince Jeta, its owner, and presented it to the Buddha for the use of the Order. For his death and subsequent apparition <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> iii, 262; <i>S.</i> i, 55.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n109" href="#fn109">109</a></sup>This layman, eminent for his knowledge of Dhamma, is fully described in the <i>Citta-Saṃyutta</i>, <i>S.</i> iv (<i>K.S.</i> iv, 190 <i>ff.</i>). Text has <i>Macchika-;</i> <i>A.</i> iii, 451, <i>Macchikā</i>-.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n110" href="#fn110">110</a></sup>Exposed in childhood as food for a <i>yakkha,</i> whom the Master converted, he was handed by the former to the latter, who returned him. Then, delivered over to the king's messenger (<i>hatthato hatthaṇ gahetvā</i>), being thus 'handed from hand to hand,' he was given this nickname. When he grew up he entered the Paths and gathered a large following by the four <i>vatthū</i> of liberality, kind speech, a useful life and equal treatment to all alike. <i>Cf. SA.</i> on <i>S.</i> i, 213; <i>SnA.</i> 217; <i>infra,</i> text 88, 136, 278.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n111" href="#fn111">111</a></sup><i>Cf. infra,</i> text 277, etc.; <i>S.</i> v, 327, 371, 375, 395, 408.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n112" href="#fn112">112</a></sup>So called because he was tall and his morals were lofty (<i>uggatā</i>). <i>Cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> iv, 67; <i>A.</i> iii, 49 <i>ff.</i> (<i>Ugga-sutta</i>).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n113" href="#fn113">113</a></sup><i>Comy.</i> calls him <i>Hatthigāmaka</i> because of his house in Elephant Town. <i>Cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> iv, 67. Burmese MSS. <i>Uggatā</i>.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n114" href="#fn114">114</a></sup>Acc. to Burmese MSS. <i>Sūrabuddho</i> and <i>Sūrabandho</i>. The only other mention of him in the Nikāyas appears to be at <i>A.</i> iii, 451 (B. <i>Sūro Kammaṭho</i>), where the same list of laymen occurs. After hearing a sermon of the Master on the impermanence of all <i>skandhas</i> he was at first deceived by Māra, the 'Evil One,' who personated the Buddha and said: '<i>Some skandhas</i> are permanent.' His loyalty made him see through the deception.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n115" href="#fn115">115</a></sup>Exposed at birth on a rubbish-heap at Rājagaha, he was found by the prince Abhaya, who brought him up: hence the name. In his sixteenth year he went to Takkasilā, the famous-university, to study medicine, was honoured by the rājah Bimbisāra, and cured the rājah Candapajjota. He lived on Vulture's Peak and also cured the Master of a sickness. <i>Cf. Vin.</i> i, 268 ff.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n116" href="#fn116">116</a></sup><i>Cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> iii, 1; iv, 73; <i>A.</i> ii, 61; iii, 295-7. On first seeing the Master he is said to have greeted him as his son. According to the legend he had been the Buddha's father or other relative in 500 births, while Nakulamātā had been his mother, etc. The couple attained the Paths together.<br/>

    (The list referred to at <i>A.</i> iii 451 contains ten other laymen — viz., Tavakaṇṇika, Pūraṇa, Isidatta, Sandhāna, Vijaya, Vajjiyamahita, Meṇḍaka, the housefathers; and Vāseṭṭha, Ariṭṭha, Sāragga, lay followers; who realized the Deathless through unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, Dhamma and Order, and through Ariyan morality, knowledge and release.)</p>
