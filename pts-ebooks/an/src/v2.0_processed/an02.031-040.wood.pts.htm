    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[37.1][than][olds]</span> On a certain occasion the venerable Kaccāna the Great was staying at Madhurā<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn81" href="#n81">81</a></sup></span><br/>

    in Gundā Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brāhmin Kaṇḍarāyana<br/>

    came to visit the venerable Kaccāna <span class="f2 g"><b>[63]</b></span> the Great<br/>

    and on coming to him greeted him courteously.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having greeted him courteously,<br/>

    he took a seat to one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said this to the venerable Kaccāna:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard it said, master Kaccāna,<br/>

    that Kaccāna the recluse<br/>

    does not salute broken-down old brāhmins,<br/>

    who are aged,<br/>

    far gone in years,<br/>

    who have reached life's end:<br/>

    nor does he stand up to greet them<br/>

    or invite them to take a seat.</p>

    <p class="f4">In so far as the master Kaccāna<br/>

    does none of these things,<br/>

    it is not well<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn82" href="#n82">82</a></sup></span> done by him."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brāhmin, the standing of old age<br/>

    and that of youth<br/>

    have been set forth by the Exalted One,<br/>

    who knows, who sees,<br/>

    that Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even though a brāhmin be old,<br/>

    eighty, ninety, a hundred years old,<br/>

    yet, if he still takes pleasure in sense-desires<br/>

    and dwells amid them,<br/>

    if he burns with the burning of sense-desires,<br/>

    is preyed on<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn83" href="#n83">83</a></sup></span> by the imagination of them,<br/>

    is eager in the quest for sense-desires,<br/>

    — then such an one is reckoned a fool.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even though a brāhmin be young,<br/>

    a mere lad, blackhaired,<br/>

    blessed with the luck of youth,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn84" href="#n84">84</a></sup></span><br/>

    in his early prime,<br/>

    yet if he takes no pleasure in sense-desires,<br/>

    dwells not amid them,<br/>

    if he burns not with the burning of sense-desires,<br/>

    is not preyed on by the imagination of them,<br/>

    is not eager in the quest for sense-desires,<br/>

    — then such an one is reckoned a wise man,<br/>

    an elder.'"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn85" href="#n85">85</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">At these words the brāhmin Kaṇḍarāyana<br/>

    rose up from his seat,<br/>

    threw his robe over one shoulder<br/>

    and worshipped with bis head<br/>

    at the feet of the monks<br/>

    who were mere<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn86" href="#n86">86</a></sup></span> lads, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Your worships are in truth old men,<br/>

    of the standing of old men.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is I who am a youngster<br/>

    and of the standing of a youngster!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent, master Kaccāna!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent it is, master Kaccāna!</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br/>

    or shows forth what is hidden,<br/>

    or points out the way<br/>

    to him that wanders astray,<br/>

    or holds up a light in the darkness,<br/>

    that they who have eyes may see objects,<br/>

    — even so in divers ways<br/>

    hath the Norm been set forth<br/>

    by the worthy Kaccāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">I myself, master Kaccāna,<br/>

    do go for refuge to that Exalted One,<br/>

    to Gotama,<br/>

    to Dhamma and to the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the worthy Kac- <span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span> cāna accept me as a follower<br/>

    from this day forth<br/>

    so long as life shall last,<br/>

    as one who hath so taken refuge."</p>

    <p>"How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?" Wikipedia has a long article on this but within it there is no mention of the issue in the Pali. There is mention of another debate at the time which also resonates with a topic in the Pali: that is as to whether the angels are sexless or not. I suggest there is a strong possibility of cross-cultural influence going on that is being missed (suppressed) by the scholars.</p>
