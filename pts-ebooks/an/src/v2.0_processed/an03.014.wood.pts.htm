    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh][upal]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, a rajah who is a world-monarch,<br/>

    a just and righteous ruler, -<br/>

    even he is not without a rajah."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">At these words a certain monk said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Who then, lord, is ruler over a world-monarch,<br/>

    a just and righteous ruler?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Dhamma, monk," replied the Exalted One,<br/>

    and went on to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, monk, a rajah who is a world-monarch,<br/>

    a just and righteous ruler,<br/>

    in dependence on Dhamma,<br/>

    honouring Dhamma,<br/>

    respectful and deferential to Dhamma,<br/>

    with Dhamma as his banner,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    with Dhamma as his standard,<br/>

    with Dhamma as his overlord,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    keeps constant watch and ward<br/>

    amongst the folk.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monk, a rajah who is a world-monarch,<br/>

    a just and righteous ruler,<br/>

    in dependence on Dhamma,<br/>

    honouring Dhamma,<br/>

    respectful and deferential to Dhamma,<br/>

    with Dhamma as his banner,<br/>

    with Dhamma as his standard,<br/>

    with Dhamma as his overlord,<br/>

    keeps constant watch and ward<br/>

    amongst the warriors who follow in his host,<br/>

    amongst the brahmins and housefathers,<br/>

    amongst dwellers in outlying parts,<br/>

    amongst recluses and brahmins,<br/>

    amongst beasts and birds alike.</p>

    <p class="f4">He it is, that rajah who is a world-monarch,<br/>

    a just and righteous ruler,<br/>

    with Dhamma as his banner,<br/>

    with Dhamma as his standard,<br/>

    with Dhamma as his overlord,<br/>

    who keeps constant watch and ward<br/>

    that rolls the wheel of sovereignty<br/>

    <p class="f4">That wheel of sovereignty<br/>

    is not to be upset by any human being whatsoever,<br/>
