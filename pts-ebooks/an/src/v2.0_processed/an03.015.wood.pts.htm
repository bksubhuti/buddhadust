    <h1>The Wheelwright or Pacetana</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh][upal]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Isipatana in the Deer Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Once upon a time, monks,<br/>

    there was a rajah named Pacetana.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now one day the rajah Pacetana said to his wheelwright:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Master wheelwright, six months hence<br/>

    there will be a battle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Can you make me a new pair of wheels,<br/>

    master wheelwright?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'I can, your honour,'<br/>

    replied the wheelwright to the rajah Pacetana.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well, when six months,<br/>

    less six days,<br/>

    were gone,<br/>

    he had finished but one wheel.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the rajah to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Master wheelwright,<br/>

    six days hence there will be a battle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the new pair of wheels complete?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Your honour, during these six months,<br/>

    less six days,<br/>

    one wheel is finished.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'But can you finish the second wheel<br/>

    in six days?'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span> 'I can, your honour,'<br/>

    rephed the wheelwright.</p>

    <p class="f4">2. Well, monks, in six days<br/>

    finishing the second wheel<br/>

    he took the new pair of wheels<br/>

    and went off to see the rajah Pacetana.</p>

    <p class="f4">On getting there he said this to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Here's the new pair of wheels finished, your honour.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Master wheelwright,<br/>

    I see no difference,<br/>

    no difference at all<br/>

    between the two wheels,<br/>

    the one you took six months,<br/>

    less six days,<br/>

    to make,<br/>

    and the one you finished in six days.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'But there is a difference, your honour.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let your honour look!'</p>

    <p class="f4">So saying, monks,<br/>

    the wheelwright set rolling<br/>

    the wheel he had finished in six days.</p>

    <p class="f4">The wheel kept rolling<br/>

    so long as the impulse that set it moving lasted.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then it circled round and round<br/>

    and fell to the ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he set rolling<br/>

    the wheel which he had finished in six months,<br/>

    less six days.</p>

    <p class="f4">It kept rollng<br/>

    so long as the impulse that set it going lasted,<br/>

    and then stood still, -<br/>

    stuck to the axle,<br/>

    you would have thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">3. 'But, master wheelwright,' said the rajah,<br/>

    'what is the reason,<br/>

    what is the cause<br/>

    why the wheel you made in six days<br/>

    rolled on while the impulse lasted,<br/>

    then circled round and round<br/>

    and fell to the ground:<br/>

    whereas the one you made in six months,<br/>

    less six days,<br/>

    stood still, -<br/>

    stuck to the axle,<br/>

    you would have thought?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Your honour, as to the wheel I finished in six days,<br/>

    its rim was crooked,<br/>

    full of faults and flaws:<br/>

    so were the spokes and hub.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the crooked,<br/>

    faulty,<br/>

    flawed nature<br/>

    of rim,<br/>

    spokes<br/>

    and hub,<br/>

    when set rolling<br/>

    it went on so long as the impulse that set it going lasted,<br/>

    then circled and fell to the ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, your honour, as to the wheel I took six months,<br/>

    less six days,<br/>

    to finish,<br/>

    its rim was not crooked;<br/>

    it was faultless,<br/>

    flawless:<br/>

    so were the spokes and hub.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the even,<br/>

    faultless,<br/>

    flawless nature<br/>

    of rim,<br/>

    spokes<br/>

    and hub,<br/>

    the wheel set rolling<br/>

    rolled on so long as the impulse that set <span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span> it moving lasted,<br/>

    then it stood still,-<br/>

    stuck to the axle,<br/>

    you would have thought.'</p>

    <p class="f4">4. Now, monks, maybe you are thinking<br/>

    that on that occasion<br/>

    that wheelwright was someone else.</p>

    <p class="f4">But you must not so think.</p>

    <p class="f4">I myself was that wheelwright<br/>

    on that occasion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, I was an expert in wood<br/>

    that was crooked,<br/>

    full of faults<br/>

    and flaws.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, I,<br/>

    the Arahant,<br/>

    who am a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>

    am expert in the crooked ways,<br/>

    the faults<br/>

    and flaws<br/>

    of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am an expert in the crooked ways,<br/>

    the faults<br/>

    and flaws<br/>

    of speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am an expert in the crooked ways,<br/>

    the faults<br/>

    and flaws<br/>

    of thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">5. Monks, in whatsoever monk or nun<br/>

    the crookedness of body,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and thought<br/>

    is not abandoned, -<br/>

    such fall<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> away from this Dhamma-Discipline,<br/>

    just like the wheel<br/>

    that was finished in six days.</p>

    <p class="f4">In whatsoever monk or nun<br/>

    the crookedness of body,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and thought<br/>

    is abandoned, -<br/>

    such are firm-set in this Dhamma-Discipline,<br/>

    just like the wheel<br/>

    that was finished in six months,<br/>

    less six days.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks,<br/>

    thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

    <p class="f4">'We will abandon the crookedness,<br/>

    the faults<br/>

    and flaws<br/>

    of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">We will abandon the crookedness,<br/>

    the faults<br/>

    and flaws<br/>

    of speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">We will abandon the crookedness,<br/>

    the faults<br/>

    and flaws<br/>

    of thought.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how ye must train yourselves, monks."</p>
