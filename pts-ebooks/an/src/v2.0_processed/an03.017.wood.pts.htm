    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh][upal]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these three qualities conduce to one's own discomfort,<br/>

    to that of other folk<br/>

    and both to one's own discomfort and that of other folk.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Immorality of deed,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three qualities which conduce to one's own discomfort,<br/>

    to that of other folk<br/>

    and both to one's own discomfort and that of other folk.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these three qualities conduce to one's own comfort,<br/>

    to that of other folk<br/>

    and both to one's own comfort and that of other folk.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Morality of deed,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three qualities which conduce to one's own comfort,<br/>

    to that of other folk<br/>

    and both to one's own comfort and that of other folk."</p>
