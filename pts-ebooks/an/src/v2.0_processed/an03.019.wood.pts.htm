    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh][upal]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of three characteristics<br/>

    a shopkeeper is incapable<br/>

    of acquiring wealth he had not before,<br/>

    of holding what he gets,<br/>

    or increasing what he holds.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the shopkeeper<br/>

    at early dawn attends not closely to his work,<br/>

    at midday attends not closely to his work,<br/>

    at eventide attends not closely to his work.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three characteristics<br/>

    possessed of which<br/>

    a shopkeeper is incapable<br/>

    of acquiring wealth he had not before,<br/>

    of holding what he gets,<br/>

    or increasing what he holds.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[100]</b></span> Just so, monks, possessed of three characteristics<br/>

    a monk is incapable of acquiring a state of profit,<br/>

    of holding it when gotten<br/>

    or increasing a state of profit when he gets it.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the three?</p>
