    <h1>Testifying with Body</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[21][pts][olds][bodh][upal]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Saviṭṭha<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> and Koṭṭhita the Great<br/>

    went to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    and on coming to him greeted him courteously.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having greeted him courtously,<br/>

    they took a seats to one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side,<br/>

    the venerable Sāriputta said this to the venerable Saviṭṭha:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend Saviṭṭha, there are these three persons to be found in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">One who has testified to the truth with body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    one who has won view,<br/>

    and one released by faith.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three persons to be found in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now sir, of these three<br/>

    which seems to you most excellent and choice?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, reverend Sāriputta,<br/>

    there are these three persons to be found in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these three<br/>

    I prefer the one released by faith.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because in this one<br/>

    the faculty of faith is most developed."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta<br/>

    asked the same question<br/>

    of the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great, who replied:</p>

    <p class="f4">"To me the one who has testified to the truth with body<br/>

    seems most excellent and choice.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because in this one<br/>

    the faculty of concentration is most developed."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great<br/>

    asked the same question<br/>

    of the venerable Sāriputta, who replied:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend Koṭṭhita, there are these three persons<br/>

    to be found in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these three he who has won view<br/>

    seems to me the most excellent and choice.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, sir, in this one<br/>

    the faculty of insight is most developed."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the venerable Sāriputta to the two others:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, sirs, we have all three<br/>

    expressed our views<br/>

    according to our several leanings.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose we go together<br/>

    to visit the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him let us tell him <span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span> of this matter.</p>

    <p class="f4">According as the Exalted One shall decide it,<br/>

    so will we uphold."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Very good, sir," said the other two<br/>

    to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">So all three went to visit the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the venerable Sāriputta told the Exalted One<br/>

    <i>[all the talk they had had on the subject].</i></p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is no easy matter, Sāriputta,<br/>

    to decide off-hand<br/>

    which of these three persons<br/>

    is the most excellent and choice.</p>

    <p class="f4">It may well be that this person<br/>

    who is released by faith<br/>

    is on the path to arahantship;<br/>

    that this one who has testified to the truth with body<br/>

    is a once-returner or a non-returner;<br/>

    that this one who has won view<br/>

    is also a once-returner or a non-returner.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is no easy thing, Sāriputta,<br/>

    to decide off-hand about this matter.</p>

    <p class="f4">It may well be that this person<br/>

    who has testified to the truth with body<br/>

    is on the path to arahantship;<br/>

    that the other two are once-returners or non-returners.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or again it may well be that this person<br/>

    who has won view<br/>

    is on the path to arahantship;<br/>

    while the two others are once-returners or non-returners.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed it is no easy task, Sāriputta,<br/>

    to decide off-hand which of these three persons<br/>

    is most excellent and choice."</p>
