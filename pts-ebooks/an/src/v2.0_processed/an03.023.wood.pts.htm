    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh][upal][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person accumulates<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> acts of body, speech and thought that are discordant.</p>

    <p class="f4">As a result of so doing he is reborn in a world that is discordant.</p>

    <p class="f4">So reborn in such a world,<br/>

    contacts that are discordant affect him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus affected by discordant contacts<br/>

    he experiences feeling that is discordant,<br/>

    utterly painful,<br/>

    such as, for instance,<br/>

    dwellers in Purgatory feel.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein again, monks, a certain person accumulates acts of body that are harmonious,<br/>

    acts of spech that are harmonious,<br/>

    acts of thought that are harmonious.</p>

    <p class="f4">As a result of this he is reborn in a world that is harmonioius.</p>

    <p class="f4">So reboorn, harmonious contacts affect him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus affected he experiences feeling that is harmonious,<br/>

    utterly blissful,<br/>

    such as the devas of the Pure Abodes feel.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet again, monks, a certain person accumulates acts of body, speech and thought<br/>

    that are both discordant and harmonious.</p>

    <p class="f4">So doing he is reborn in a world that is both discordant and harmonious.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus reborn, contacts both discordant and harmonious affect him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus affected he experiences feelings both discordant and harmonious,<br/>

    a mixture<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of pleasure and pain,<br/>

    such as for instance some human beings,<br/>

    some devas and some dwellers in Purgatory feel.</p>

    <p class="f4">So there are these three persons found existing in the world.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>
