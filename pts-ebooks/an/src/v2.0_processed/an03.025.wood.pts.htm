    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh][upal]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">The one whose mind is like an open sore,<br/>

    the lightning-minded<br/>

    and the diamond-minded.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what sort, monks, is the one whose mind is like an open sore?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a certain person is irritable and turbulent.</p>

    <p class="f4">When anything,<br/>

    no matter how trifling,<br/>

    is said to him,<br/>

    he becomes enraged,<br/>

    he gets angry and quarrelsome:<br/>

    he resents it and displays anger,<br/>

    hatred<br/>

    and sulkiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, for instance,<br/>

    when a festering sore,<br/>

    if struck by a stick or sherd,<br/>

    discharges matter all the more,<br/>

    even so, monks, a certain person is irritable and turbulent.</p>

    <p class="f4">When anything,<br/>

    no matter how trifling,<br/>

    is said to him,<br/>

    he becomes enraged,<br/>

    he gets angry and quarrelsome:<br/>

    he resents it and displays anger,<br/>

    hatred<br/>

    and sulkiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one is called:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He whose mind is like an open sore.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the lightning-minded?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a certain person understands,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ending of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, monks,<br/>

    a man with good eyesight<br/>

    sees objects in the gloom of murky darkness<br/>

    by a flash <span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span> of lightning,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    even so in this case<br/>

    a certain person understands,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ending of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one, monks, is called:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He whose mind is like a lightning-flash.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the diamond-minded?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a certain person,<br/>

    by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/>

    himself in this very life<br/>

    comes to know thoroughly<br/>

    the heart's release,<br/>

    the release by insight<br/>

    which is freed from the āsavas,<br/>

    and having attained it<br/>

    abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, monks, there is nothing,<br/>

    whether gem or rock,<br/>

    which a diamond cannot cut,<br/>

    even so a certain person,<br/>

    by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/>

    himself in this very life<br/>

    comes to know thoroughly<br/>

    the heart's release,<br/>

    the release by insight<br/>

    which is freed from the āsavas,<br/>

    and having attained it<br/>

    abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one is called:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The diamond-minded.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, these three persons are found existing in the world.'</p>
