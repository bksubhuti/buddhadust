    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons<br/>

    are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is a person who is to be shunned as loathsome,<br/>

    not to <span class="f2 g"><b>[109]</b></span> be followed,<br/>

    served<br/>

    and honoured.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is a person who is to be regarded with indifference,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    not to be followed,<br/>

    served<br/>

    and honoured.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is a person who is to be followed,<br/>

    served<br/>

    and honoured.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what sort, monks, is the one<br/>

    who is to be shunned?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person is immoral,<br/>

    an evil-doer,<br/>

    impure,<br/>

    of suspicious behaviour,<br/>

    of covert deeds.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is no recluse,<br/>

    though he pretends to be one:<br/>

    he is no liver of the righteous life,<br/>

    though he pretends to be:<br/>

    rotten within<br/>

    and full of lusts,<br/>

    a rubbish-heap of filth is he.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Such an one, monks,<br/>

    is to be shunned as loathsome,<br/>

    not to be followed,<br/>

    served<br/>

    and honoured.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, even though one do not profess adherence<br/>

    to the views of such a man,<br/>

    nevertheless an ill report<br/>

    spreads abroad about one,<br/>

    that he is a man who associates with evil-doers,<br/>

    a man who has bad friends,<br/>

    one who consorts with the wicked.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, suppose a snake<br/>

    goes into a dunghill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he does not bite<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    (the one who takes him out),<br/>

    yet he befouls him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, monks,<br/>

    though one do not profess adherence<br/>

    to the views of such a man,<br/>

    nevertheless an ill report<br/>

    spreads abroad about one,<br/>

    that he is a man who associates with evil-doers,<br/>

    a man who has bad friends,<br/>

    one who consorts with the wicked.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks,<br/>

    such an one is to be shunned as loathsome,<br/>

    not to be followed,<br/>

    served<br/>

    and honoured.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the person who is to be treated with indifference?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>

    is irritable and turbulent.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When anything,<br/>

    however trifling,<br/>

    is said to him<br/>

    he becomes enraged,<br/>

    gets angry and quarrelsome:<br/>

    he resents it,<br/>

    and displays anger,<br/>

    hatred<br/>

    and sulkiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as when a festering sore,<br/>

    if struck by a stick or sherd,<br/>

    discharges matter all the more,<br/>

    even so a certain person<br/>

    is irritable and turbulent.</p>

    <p class="f4">When anything,<br/>

    however trifling,<br/>

    is said to him<br/>

    he becomes enraged,<br/>

    gets angry and quarrelsome:<br/>

    he resents it,<br/>

    and displays anger,<br/>

    hatred<br/>

    and sulkiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as a firebrand of tinduka<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> wood,<br/>

    if struck <span class="f2 g"><b>[110]</b></span> by a stick or sherd,<br/>

    fizzles and sputters all the more,<br/>

    even so a certain person<br/>

    is irritable and turbulent.</p>

    <p class="f4">When anything,<br/>

    however trifling,<br/>

    is said to him<br/>

    he becomes enraged,<br/>

    gets angry and quarrelsome:<br/>

    he resents it,<br/>

    and displays anger,<br/>

    hatred<br/>

    and sulkiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as a cesspit<br/>

    stirred with a stick or sherd<br/>

    gives out a stench<br/>

    more noisome than before,<br/>

    even so a certain person<br/>

    is irritable and turbulent.</p>

    <p class="f4">When anything,<br/>

    however trifling,<br/>

    is said to him<br/>

    he becomes enraged,<br/>

    gets angry and quarrelsome:<br/>

    he resents it,<br/>

    and displays anger,<br/>

    hatred<br/>

    and sulkiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such a person, monks,<br/>

    is to be regarded with indifierence<br/>

    not to be followed,<br/>

    served<br/>

    and honoured.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because one thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"He might curse me."</p>

    <p class="f4">"He might abuse me."</p>

    <p class="f4">"He might do me some injury."</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks,<br/>

    such a person is to be treated with indifierence,<br/>

    he is not to be followed,<br/>

    served<br/>

    and honoured.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the person who is to be followed,<br/>

    served<br/>

    and honoured?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case<br/>

    a certain person is virtuous,<br/>

    of a lovely nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such an one should be followed,<br/>

    served<br/>

    and honoured.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, although one may not profess<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> adherence to his views,<br/>

    yet a fair report spreads abroad<br/>

    that one is a man who associates with the lovely,<br/>

    a man who has worthy friends,<br/>

    a man who consorts with the worthy.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore such an one is to be followed,<br/>

    served<br/>

    and honoured.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the three persons<br/>

    found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Who follows mean companions soon decays:<br/>

    He never fails who with his equals mates:<br/>

    Who leans towards the noble rises soon.<br/>

    Then do thou serve a better than thyself.'</p>
