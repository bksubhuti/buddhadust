    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[110]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">The tricky-tongued,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    the fair-spoken<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    and the honey-tongued.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the tricky-tongued?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is summoned to go before <span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span> a court,<br/>

    a company or gathering of his relations,<br/>

    or a guild,<br/>

    or to the royal palace,<br/>

    and as an eye-witness (of some deed) is cross-examined thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come now, my man,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> say what you know!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, though ignorant, he says that he knows.</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he knows, he denies all knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he was not an eye-witness of the event,<br/>

    he says he was.</p>

    <p class="f4">Though an eye-witness, he denies it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus to shield himself or others,<br/>

    or for the sake of some triffling gain,<br/>

    he knowingly tells a lie.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one, monks, is called 'the tricky-tongued.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the fair-spoken?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is summoned to go before a court,<br/>

    a company or gathering of his relations,<br/>

    or a guild,<br/>

    or to the royal palace,<br/>

    and as an eye-witness (of some deed) is cross-examined thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come now, my man, say what you know!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, ignorant, he denies all knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">Knowing, he says that he knows.</p>

    <p class="f4">An eye-witness of the event,<br/>

    he says he was.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not an eye-witness, he denies it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus neither to shield himself or others,<br/>

    nor for the sake of some triffling gain,<br/>

    does he knowingly tell a lie.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one, monks, is called 'the fair-spoken.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the honey-tongued?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person,<br/>

    abandoning harsh speech, abstains therefrom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is harmless,<br/>

    pleasant to the ear,<br/>

    agreeable,<br/>

    touching the heart,<br/>

    courteous,<br/>

    delightful to many folk,<br/>

    pleasant to many folk<br/>

    — such speech he uses.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one is called 'the honey-tongued.'</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three persons found existing in the world."</p>
