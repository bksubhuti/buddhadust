    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three persons<br/>

    found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">The blind,<br/>

    the one-eyed,<br/>

    the two-eyed.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the blind?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br/>

    has not the eye to acquire wealth unattained,<br/>

    or to make the wealth he has increase.</p>

    <p class="f4">He has not the eye<br/>

    fit to see states that are good and bad,<br/>

    to see states that are blameworthy and praiseworthy,<br/>

    states mean and exalted,<br/>

    states resembling light and darkness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one, monks, is called 'the blind.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the one-eyed?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person has the eye to acquire wealth unattained,<br/>

    and to make the wealth he has increase,<br/>

    but has not the eye<br/>

    to see states that are good and bad,<br/>

    to see states that are blameworthy and praiseworthy,<br/>

    states mean and exalted,<br/>

    states resembling light and darkness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one is called 'the one-eyed.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span> And of what sort, monks, is the two-eyed?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person has both<br/>

    the eye to acquire wealth unattained<br/>

    and the eye to make the wealth he has increase,<br/>

    and the eye to see states that are good and bad,<br/>

    to see states that are blameworthy and praiseworthy,<br/>

    states mean and exalted,<br/>

    states resembling light and darkness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one is called 'the two-eyed.'</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three persons<br/>

    found existing in the world."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The blind, of sight bereft, hath no such wealth,<br/>

    Nor works good deeds, unlucky in both ways.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    And then again 'tis said the one-eyed man,<br/>

    Conjoined<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> with right and wrong, searches for wealth<br/>

    With tricks and fraud and lies: worldly, purse-proud,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    And clever to gain wealth is he, and hence<br/>

    Departing is afflicted sore in Hell.<br/>

    But best of all's the being with two eyes:<br/>

    His wealth, with right exertion rightly won,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    He gives away: with best intent, unwavering,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    In a blessed home he's born, nor sorrows there.<br/>

    So from the blind and one-eyed keep aloof,<br/>

    And join thyself to worthy two-eyed man.</p>
