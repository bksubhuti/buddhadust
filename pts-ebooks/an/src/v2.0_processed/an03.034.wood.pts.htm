    <h1>Of Āḷavī<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Āḷavī,<br/>

    at Cowpath in Siṇsapa Grove,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    lodging on the leaf-strewn ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Hatthaka of Āḷavī<br/>

    was wandering there afoot,<br/>

    and as he went along<br/>

    he saw the Exalted One in that place,<br/>

    seated on the ground strewn with leaves.</p>

    <p class="f4">On seeing him he approached<br/>

    and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated Hatthakka of Āḷavī<br/>

    said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, does the Exalted One live happily?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, my lad, I live happily.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am one of those who live happily in the world."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, sir, the winter nights are cold,<br/>

    the dark half of the month<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is the time of snowfall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hard is the ground<br/>

    trampled <span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span> by the hoofs of cattle,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    thin the carpet of fallen leaves,<br/>

    sparse are the leaves of the tree,<br/>

    cold are the saffron robes<br/>

    and cold the gale of wind that blows."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Still, my lad,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    I live happily.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of those who live happy in the world<br/>

    I am one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, my lad,<br/>

    I will question you about this<br/>

    and do you reply as you think fit.</p>

    <p class="f4">What think you, my lad?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose a housefather or housefather's son<br/>

    has a house with a gabled roof,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

    plastered inside and out,<br/>

    with well-fitting doors and casements.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therein is a couch<br/>

    spread with a long-fleeced woolen rug,<br/>

    a bed-spread of white wool,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    a coverlet embroidered with flowers,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    spread with a costly skin of antelope,<br/>

    having a canopy overhead<br/>

    and a scarlet cushion at each end.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here is a lamp burning<br/>

    and four wives to wait upon him<br/>

    with all their charms.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, my lad?</p>

    <p class="f4">Would he live happily or not?</p>

    <p class="f4">How think you?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, he would, sir.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is one of those<br/>

    who live happily in the world."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Well now, my lad,<br/>

    what think you?</p>

    <p class="f4">Would there not arise<br/>

    in that housefather or housefather's son<br/>

    torments of body or of mind<br/>

    that are born of lust<br/>

    so that, tortured by them,<br/>

    he would live unhappily?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"They would arise, sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, my lad,<br/>

    as to those torments of body or of mind<br/>

    born of lust,<br/>

    tortured by which he would live unhappily,<br/>

    that lust has been abandoned by the Tathāgata,<br/>

    cut off at the root,<br/>

    made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>

    made unable to become again,<br/>

    of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is why I live happily.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span> Again, would there not arise<br/>

    in that housefather or housefather's son<br/>

    torments of body or of mind<br/>

    that are born of malice<br/>

    so that, tortured by them,<br/>

    he would live unhappily?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"They would arise, sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, my lad, as to those torments of body or of mind<br/>

    born of malice,<br/>

    tortured by which he would live unhappily,<br/>

    that malice has been abandoned by the Tathāgata,<br/>

    cut off at the root,<br/>

    made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>

    made unable to become again,<br/>

    of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is why I live happily.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, would not there arise<br/>

    in that housefather or housefather's son<br/>

    torments of body or of mind<br/>

    that are born of delusion<br/>

    so that, tortured by them,<br/>

    he would live unhappily?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"They would arise, sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, my lad, as to those torments of body or of mind<br/>

    born of delusion,<br/>

    tortured by which he would live unhappily,<br/>

    that delusion has been abandoned by the Tathāgata,<br/>

    cut off at the root,<br/>

    made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>

    made unable to become again,<br/>

    of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is why I live happily."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Yea, happily he lives, the Brāhman<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> set free<br/>

    Whom lusts defile not, who is cooled and loosed from bonds,<br/>

    Who hath all barriers burst, restraining his heart's pain.<br/>

    Happy the calm one lives who wins the peace of mind.'</p>
