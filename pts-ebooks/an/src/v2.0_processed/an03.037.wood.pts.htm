    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][wrrn][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Once upon a time, monks, Sakka, lord of the Devas,<br/>

    was instructing<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Devas of the Thirty-Three,<br/>

    and on that ocoasion uttered this verse:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'He who would be like unto me should keep<br/>

    The fourteenth, fifteenth day and eke the eighth<br/>

    Of the half-month, likewise the extra fast,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    To observance of the precepts eight well given.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, this verse was ill sung,<br/>

    not well sung<br/>

    by Sakka, lord of the Devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">It was wrongly,<br/>

    not rightly uttered.</p>

    <p class="f4">How so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, Sakka, lord of the Devas,<br/>

    was not rid of passion,<br/>

    not rid of malice,<br/>

    not rid of delusion:<br/>

    whereas a monk who is arahant,<br/>

    one in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br/>

    who has lived the life,<br/>

    done what was to be done,<br/>

    who has laid down the burden,<br/>

    attained his own welfare,<br/>

    utterly destroyed the fetter of becoming,<br/>

    who is perfectly released by knowledge, -<br/>

    by such an one this saying of:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'He who would be like unto me should keep<br/>

    The fourteenth, fifteenth day and eke the eighth<br/>

    Of the half-month, likewise the extra fast,<br/>

    To observance of the precepts eight well given.'</p>

    <p class="f4">were fitly uttered.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because that monk is rid of passion,<br/>

    rid of malice,<br/>

    rid of delusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, monks, Sakka,<br/>

    lord of the Devas,<br/>

    <p class="f4">How so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, Sakka, lord of the Devas,<br/>

    was not released from birth,<br/>

    old age<br/>
