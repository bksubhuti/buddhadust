    <h1>Delicately Nurtured<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I was delicately nurtured,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    exceeding delicately nurtured,<br/>

    delicately nurtured beyond measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">For instance,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    in my father's house<br/>

    lotus-pools were made thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">one of blue lotuses,<br/>

    one of red lotuses,<br/>

    another of white lotuses,<br/>

    just for my benefit.</p>

    <p class="f4">No sandal-wood powder did I use<br/>

    that was not from Kasi:<br/>

    of Kasi cloth was my turban made:<br/>

    of Kasi cloth was my jacket,<br/>

    my tunic<br/>

    and my cloak.</p>

    <p class="f4">By night and day<br/>

    a white canopy was held over me,<br/>

    lest cold or heat,<br/>

    dust or chaff<br/>

    or dew,<br/>

    should touch me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks,<br/>

    I had three palaces:<br/>

    one for winter,<br/>

    one for summer,<br/>

    and one for the rainy season.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">In the four months of the rains<br/>

    I was waited on by minstrels,<br/>

    women all of them.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">I came not down from my palace<br/>

    in those months.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, whereas in other men's homes<br/>

    broken rice<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> together with sour gruel<br/>

    is given as food to slave-servants,<br/>

    in my father's home<br/>

    they were given rice,<br/>

    meat<br/>

    and milk-rice<br/>

    for their food.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me, monks,<br/>

    thus blest with much prosperity,<br/>

    thus <span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span> nurtured with exceeding delicacy,<br/>

    this thought occurred:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely one of the uneducated manyfolk,<br/>

    though himself subject to old age and decay,<br/>

    not having passed beyond old age and decay,<br/>

    when he sees another broken down with age,<br/>

    is troubled,<br/>

    ashamed,<br/>

    disgusted,<br/>

    forgetful that he himsejf is such an one.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now I too am subject to old age and decay,<br/>

    not having passed beyond old age and decay.</p>

    <p class="f4">Were I to see another broken down with old age,<br/>

    I might be troubled,<br/>

    ashamed<br/>

    and disgusted.</p>

    <p class="f4">That would not be seemly in me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, -<br/>

    as I considered the matter,<br/>

    all pride in my youth deserted me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, I thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'One of the uneducated many-folk,<br/>

    though himself subject to disease,<br/>

    not having passed beyond disease,<br/>

    when he sees another person diseased,<br/>

    is troubled,<br/>

    ashamed<br/>

    and disgusted,<br/>

    forgetful that he himself is such an one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now I too am subject to disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have not passed beyond disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Were I to see another diseased,<br/>

    I might be troubled,<br/>

    ashamed,<br/>

    disgusted.</p>

    <p class="f4">That would not be seemly in me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, as I considered the matter,<br/>

    all pride in my health deserted me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, I thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'One of the uneducated manyfolk,<br/>

    though himself subject to death,<br/>

    not having passed beyond death,<br/>

    when he sees another person subject to death<br/>

    is troubled,<br/>

    disgusted<br/>

    and ashamed,<br/>

    forgetful that he himself is such an one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now I too am subject to death.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have not passed beyond death.</p>

    <p class="f4">Were I to see another subject to death,<br/>

    I might be troubled,<br/>

    ashamed,<br/>

    disgusted.</p>

    <p class="f4">That would not be seemly in me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, as I considered the matter,<br/>

    all pride in my life deserted me."</p>
