    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, the inhabitants of a village or suburb<br/>

    where virtuous hermits dwell for their support<br/>

    beget much merit in three ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">In deed,<br/>

    word<br/>

    and thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three ways<br/>

    the inhabitants of a village or suburb<br/>

    where virtuous hermits dwell for their support<br/>

    beget much merit."</p>
