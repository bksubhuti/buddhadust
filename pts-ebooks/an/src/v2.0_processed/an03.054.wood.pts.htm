    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brahmin who was a Wanderer came to see the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>

    that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to the saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">master Gotama,<br/>

    pray how far is Dhamma seen in this life?</p>

    <p class="f4">How far is it a thing not involving time,<br/>

    inviting one to come and see,<br/>

    leading onward,<br/>

    to be realized for themselves<br/>

    by the wise?"</p>
