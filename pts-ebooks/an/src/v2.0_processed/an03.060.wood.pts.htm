    <h1>Saṇgārava</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[168]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Saṇgārava,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the brahmin, came to see the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>

    that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">2. "Master Gotama, we brahmins,<br/>

    let me tell you,<br/>

    offer sacrifice<br/>

    and cause others to do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, master Gotama<br/>

    whoso offers sacrifice<br/>

    or causes others to do so,<br/>

    one and all are proficient<br/>

    in a practice of merit<br/>

    that affects many persons;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    that is,<br/>

    which results from offering sacrifice.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br/>

    he who goes forth<br/>

    as a Wanderer from this or that family,<br/>

    from the home to the homeless life,<br/>

    tames only the single self,<br/>

    calms only the single self,<br/>

    leads to Nibbāna<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    only the single self.</p>

    <p class="f4">So what I say is,<br/>

    thus he is proficient in a practice of merit<br/>

    that affects only one person,<br/>

    as a result of his going forth (as a Wanderer)."</p>

    <p class="f4">3. "Well, brahmin, as to that I will question you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you answer as you think fit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, brahmin?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this connexion<br/>

    a Tathāgata arises in the world,<br/>

    an Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>

    perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>

    Wellfarer,<br/>

    World-knower,<br/>

    incomparable Charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>

    Teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>

    a Buddha,<br/>

    an Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">He says thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come! this is the way,<br/>

    this the practice,<br/>

    proficient in which<br/>

    I make known that incomparable <span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span> bliss<br/>

    wbich is steeped in the holy life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    by my own powers of comprehension realizing it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Come ye also!</p>

    <p class="f4">Practise so that ye too<br/>

    may be proficient therein,<br/>

    so that ye too<br/>

    by your own powers of comprehension<br/>

    may realize it<br/>

    and abide therein.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus this teacher teaches Dhamma<br/>

    and others too practise to attain that end.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover there are many hundreds,<br/>

    many thousands,<br/>

    many hundreds of thousands of such.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, brahmin?</p>

    <p class="f4">Since this is so,<br/>

    is it a practice of merit<br/>

    affecting only one person<br/>

    or many persons;<br/>

    that is,<br/>

    the result of going forth as a Wanderer?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, master Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">It affects many persons,<br/>

    this going forth."</p>

    <p class="f4">3. At these words<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda said this<br/>

    to the brahmin Saṇgārava:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Of these two practices, brahmin,<br/>

    which appeals to you as being the simpler,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    the less troublesome,<br/>

    of greater fruit,<br/>

    profit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words<br/>

    the brahmin Saṇgārava said this<br/>

    to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just like the worthy Gotama<br/>

    and the worthy Ānanda,<br/>

    both are to me<br/>

    worthy of honour and praise."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a second time<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda said<br/>

    to the brahmin Saṇgārava:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do not ask you that, brahmin,<br/>

    as to whom you honour and praise.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is what I am asking you:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Which of the two practices appeals to you<br/>

    as being the simpler<br/>

    and less troublesome,<br/>

    of greater fruit<br/>

    of greater profit?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Again the brahmin Saṇgārava said this<br/>

    to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just like the worthy Gotama<br/>

    and the worthy Ānanda,<br/>

    both are to me<br/>

    worthy of honour and praise."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a third time<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda said<br/>

    to the brahmin Saṇgārava:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do not ask you that, brahmin,<br/>

    as to whom you honour and praise.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is what I am asking you:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Which of the two practices appeals to you<br/>

    as being the simpler<br/>

    and less troublesome,<br/>

    of greater fruit<br/>

    of greater profit'"?</p>

    <p class="f4">Again the brahmin Saṇgārava said this<br/>

    to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just like the worthy Gotama<br/>

    and the worthy Ānanda,<br/>

    both are to me<br/>

    worthy of honour and praise."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[153]</b></span> 3. Thereupon the Exalted One thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even for a third time the brahmin,<br/>

    on being asked a pertinent<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> question by Ānanda,<br/>

    evades<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> it,<br/>

    does not reply to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I release them<br/>

    from their difficulty."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Exalted One said this<br/>

    to the brahmin Saṇgārava:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Tell me, brahmin.</p>

    <p class="f4">What was the topic of conversation today<br/>

    when the royal party sat together in company<br/>

    in the rajah's palace?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This was the topic of conversation, master Gotama: -</p>

    <p class="f4">'In former times, you know,<br/>

    monks were fewer in number:<br/>

    but those possessed of supernormal powers<br/>

    being more numerous,<br/>

    they showed the marvel of more-power.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But now it is just the opposite.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That was the topic of conversation today, master Gotama,<br/>

    when the royal party sat together in company<br/>

    in the rajah's palace."</p>

    <p class="f4">4. "Now as to that, brahmin,<br/>

    there are these three marvels.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">The marvel of more-power,<br/>

    the marvel of thought-reading,<br/>

    the marvel of teaching.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brahmin, is the marvel of more-power?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain one enjoys sorts of more-power<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> in divers ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/>

    from being many he becomes one:<br/>

    manifest or invisible<br/>

    he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/>

    through a rampart,<br/>

    through a mountain,<br/>

    as if through the air:<br/>

    he plunges into the earth<br/>

    and shoots up again<br/>

    as if in water:<br/>

    he walks upon the water<br/>

    without parting it<br/>

    as if on solid ground:<br/>

    he travels through the air<br/>

    sitting cross-legged,<br/>

    like a bird upon the wing:<br/>

    even this moon and sun,<br/>

    though of such mighty power and majesty, -<br/>

    he handles them<br/>

    and strokes them with his hand:<br/>

    even as far as the Brahma <span class="f2 g"><b>[154]</b></span> world<br/>

    he has power with his body.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br/>

    'the marvel of more-power.'</p>

    <p class="f4">5. And what, brahmin,<br/>

    is the marvel of thought-reading?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">In this case<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> a certain one<br/>

    can declare by means of a sign:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>

    so it is<br/>

    and not otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">And again, brahmin,<br/>

    perhaps a certain one<br/>

    does not declare such things by means of a sign,<br/>

    but he does so after hearing a voice from men<br/>

    or non-humans<br/>

    or from devas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/>

    and says:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>

    so it is<br/>

    and not otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here again, brahmin,<br/>

    perhaps a certain one<br/>

    does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br/>

    or on hearing a voice from men<br/>

    or non-humans<br/>

    or from devas,<br/>

    but he does so (judging) from some sound he has heard,<br/>

    an utterance intelligently made<br/>

    by one who is reasoning intelligently.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">So hearing he declares:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br/>

    so it is<br/>

    and not otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span> Then again, brahmin,<br/>

    in this case suppose a certain one<br/>

    does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br/>

    or on hearing a voice from men<br/>

    or non-humans<br/>

    or from devas,<br/>

    or by (judging) from some sound he has heard,<br/>

    an utterance intelligently made<br/>

    by one who is reasoning intelligently<br/>

    yet maybe,<br/>

    when he has attained a state of concentration<br/>

    which is void of thought applied and sustained,<br/>

    one's mind can read another's thoughts<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span><br/>

    and know thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'According to the nature<br/>

    of the thinkings of this worthy,<br/>

    on such and such objects<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span><br/>

    will he immediately<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span> direct his thoughts.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then however much he may tell,<br/>

    so it is<br/>

    and not otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br/>

    'the marvel of mind-reading.'</p>

    <p class="f4">6. And what, brahmin,<br/>

    is the marvel of teaching?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain one teaches thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Reason thus,<br/>

    not thus.</p>

    <p class="f4">Apply your mind thus,<br/>

    not thus.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandon this state,<br/>

    acquire that state<br/>

    and abide therein.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br/>

    'the marvel of teaching.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So these are the three marvels.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now of these three marvels,<br/>

    which appeals to you<br/>

    as the more wonderful and excellent"?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Of these marvels, master Gotama,<br/>

    <p class="f4">The monks possessed of these three marvellous powers<br/>

    are not just one or two<br/>

    or three, four, or five hundced,<br/>

    but much more than that in number."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, master Gotama,<br/>

    where are those monks now dwelling?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"In this very Order of Monks, brahmin."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Excellent, master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent it is, master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br/>

    or shows forth what is hidden,<br/>

    or points out the way to him that wanders astray,<br/>

    or holds up a light in the darkness,<br/>

    that they who have eyes ay see objects, —<br/>

    even so in divers ways<br/>

    hath the Norm been set forth by the worthy Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">I myself, master Gotama,<br/>

    do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama,<br/>

    to Dhamma<br/>

    and to the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama<br/>

    accept me as a lay-follower<br/>

    from this day forth<br/>

    so long as life shall last,<br/>

    as one who has taken refuge in him."</p>
