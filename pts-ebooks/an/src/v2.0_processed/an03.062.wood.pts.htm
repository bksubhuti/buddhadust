    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][olds][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">2. "Monks, the uneducated manyfolk speaks of these three terrors<br/>

    that part mother and son.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

    <p class="f4">There comes a time<br/>

    when a great fire breaks out.</p>

    <p class="f4">When these are burning,<br/>

    the mother cannot reach her son,<br/>

    there comes a time<br/>

    when a mighty rain falls.</p>

    a great flood is caused.</p>

    <p class="f4">When the flood comes,<br/>

    villages,<br/>

    suburbs<br/>

    <p>The phrase "a way which joins mother and son" is a mis-translation, and a dangerous and misleading one at that. The sutta is speaking about overcoming terrors, not ways to unite mother and son. Further the Way is not a way to unite mothers and sons except possibly in the sense of both being followers at the same time, that is, being united in an idea, certainly there is no idea here of being united in some after-life. See the Olds translation or the Bhk. Thanissaro translation for the way this whole sutta should have been handled.</p>
