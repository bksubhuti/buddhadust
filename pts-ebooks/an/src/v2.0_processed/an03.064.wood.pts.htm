    <h1>Sarabha</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[185]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[167]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha<br/>

    on the hill Vulture's Peak.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time Sarabha<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> so called,<br/>

    the Wanderer,<br/>

    who had not long since deserted this Dhamma-Discipline,<br/>

    was thus speaking in the company<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> at Rājagaha:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span> "I understand the 'Dhamma'<br/>

    of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br/>

    that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">2. Then a number of monks,<br/>

    having robed themselves,<br/>

    taking bowl and outer robe,<br/>

    entered Rājagaha to beg.</p>

    <p class="f4">And those monks heard Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>

    so speaking<br/>

    in the company at Rājagaha.</p>

    <p class="f4">So when they had done their begging-rounds<br/>

    and had returned and eaten their meal,<br/>

    they went to the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/>

    they said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>

    has not long since deserted this Dhamma-Discipline.</p>

    <p class="f4">At Rājagaha he is thus speaking in the company:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I understand the "Dhamma"<br/>

    of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br/>

    that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Lord, it would be well<br/>

    if the Exalted One were to go to Snake River bank,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    to the Wanderers' Park<br/>

    where is Sarabha the Wanderer,<br/>

    out of compassion for him."</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One consented by silence.</p>

    <p class="f4">3. So the Exalted One,<br/>

    rising up from his solitary meditation at eventide,<br/>

    went to Snake River bank,<br/>

    to visit Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>

    in the Wanderers' Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">On reaching this<br/>

    he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having done so<br/>

    the Exalted One said this<br/>

    to Sarabha the Wanderer:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is it true, as I hear, Sarabha,<br/>

    that you say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I understand the "Dhamma"<br/>

    of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br/>

    that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a second time<br/>

    the Exalted One spoke to Sarabha the Wanderer, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Speak, Sarabha!</p>

    <p class="f4">How is it that you have understood<br/>

    the 'Dhamma' of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons?</p>

    <p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete<br/>

    I will complete it for you.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it is complete<br/>

    I shall receive it gladly."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span> And a second time Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then for the third time<br/>

    the Exalted One spoke to Sarabha the Wanderer, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sarabha, it is by me<br/>

    that the 'Dhamma' of the Sakyans' sons<br/>

    who are recluses<br/>

    has been revealed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Speak, Sarabha!</p>

    <p class="f4">How is it that you have understood<br/>

    the 'Dhamma' of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons?</p>

    <p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete<br/>

    I will complete it for you.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it is complete<br/>

    I shall receive it gladly."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">4. Thereupon the Wanderers of Rājagaha<br/>

    said this to Sarabha the Wanderer:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, whatever you may have to ask Gotama the recluse,<br/>

    he gives you the opportunity to do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Speak, reverend Sarabha!</p>

    <p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete,<br/>

    Gotama the recluse will complete it for you.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it is complete,<br/>

    he will receive it gladly."</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Sarabha the Wanderer remained silent,<br/>

    confused,<br/>

    hanging his head,<br/>

    looking downwards,<br/>

    a disappointed man,<br/>

    unable to make reply.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">5. So the Exalted One,<br/>

    seeing him in this condition,<br/>

    said to those Wanderers:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wanderers,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> if any one should say to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'You have not perfect knowledge of these things,<br/>

    though you claim to be fully enlightened,'</p>

    <p class="f4">I should closely examine him,<br/>

    question him<br/>

    and talk with him.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He, thus closely examined,<br/>

    questioned<br/>

    and talked with,<br/>

    would surely and inevitably<br/>

    be reduced to one of these three conditions: -</p>

    <p class="f4">Either he would shelve the question by another,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    and direct the talk to an alien subject;</p>

    <p class="f4">or he would display anger,<br/>

    malignity<br/>

    and sulkiness;</p>

    <p class="f4">or he would sit silent,<br/>

    confused,<br/>

    hanging his head,<br/>

    looking downwards,<br/>

    a disappointed man,<br/>

    unable to make reply,<br/>

    just as now does Sarabha the Wanderer.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span> Wanderers, if any one were to say to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The "Dhamma" preached by you<br/>

    for the purpose of utterly destroying Ill<br/>

    does not lead those who act accordingly<br/>

    to such a goal,'</p>

    <p class="f4">I should closely examine him,<br/>

    question him<br/>

    and talk with him.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, thus closely examined,<br/>

    questioned<br/>

    and talked with,<br/>

    would surely and inevitably<br/>

    be reduced to one of these three conditions: -</p>

    <p class="f4">Either he would shelve the question by another,<br/>

    and direct the talk to an alien subject;</p>

    <p class="f4">or he would display anger,<br/>

    malignity<br/>

    and sulkiness;</p>

    <p class="f4">or he would sit silent,<br/>

    confused,<br/>

    hanging his head,<br/>

    looking downwards,<br/>

    a disappointed man,<br/>

    unable to make reply,<br/>

    just as now does Sarabha the Wanderer.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, having thrice<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> uttered his lion's roar<br/>

    in the Wanderers' Park<br/>

    on the bank of Snake River,<br/>

    departed through the air.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">6. Now not long after the departure of the Exalted One<br/>

    those Wanderers assailed Sarabha the Wanderer on all sides<br/>

    with a torrent of abuse,<br/>

    and poking fun at him said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend Sarabha, even as a decrepit jackal<br/>

    in the great forest,<br/>

    thinking to utter a lion's roar,<br/>

    can only let out just a jackal's scream,<br/>

    so you, friend Sarabha,<br/>

    thinking to utter the lion's roar<br/>

    which none but Gotama the recluse can utter, -<br/>

    you give just such a jackal's scream.</p>

    <p class="f4">Friend Sarabha, just as a poor little hen<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>

    thinks to crow like a cock,<br/>

    and after all lets out just a poor little hen's cackle,<br/>

    so you, friend Sarabha,<br/>

    thinking to utter the cock-crow<br/>

    that none but Gotama the recluse can utter,<br/>

    let out just a poor little hen's cackle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Friend Sarabha, just as a young bull-calf,<br/>

    when the cow-pen is empty,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>

    thinks he bellows deeply (like an old bull),<br/>

    so you, friend Sarabha,<br/>

    think to utter the deep bellow<br/>

    that none but Gotama the recluse can utter."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus did those Wanderers assail Sarabha the Wanderer<br/>

    with a torrent of abuse,<br/>

    poking fun at him.</p>
