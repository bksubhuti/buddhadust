    <h1>Those of Kesaputta</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[188]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][soma][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One,<br/>

    while going his rounds among the Kosalans<br/>

    with a great <span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span> company of monks, came to Kesaputta,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> a district of the Kosalans.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard it said that Gotama the recluse,<br/>

    the Sakyans' son who went forth as a wanderer from the Sakyan clan,<br/>

    had reached Kesaputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">And this good report was noised abroad about Gotama, that Exalted One, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"He it is, the Exalted One,<br/>

    Arahant,<br/>

    a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>

    perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>

    Wellfarer,<br/>

    world-knower,<br/>

    unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>

    teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>

    a Buddha,<br/>

    an Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It were indeed a good thing to get sight of such arahants!"</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Kālāmas of Kesaputta came to see the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">On reaching him, some saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side:<br/>

    some greeted the Exalted One courteously,<br/>

    and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>

    sat down at one side:<br/>

    some raising their joined palms to the Exalted One<br/>

    sat down at one side:<br/>

    some proclaimed their name and clan<br/>

    and did likewise;<br/>

    while others without saying anything<br/>

    just sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then as they thus sat<br/>

    the Kālāmas of Kesaputta said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">2. "Sir, certain recluses and brahmins come to Kesaputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to their own view,<br/>

    they proclaim and expound it in full:<br/>

    but as to the view of others,<br/>

    they abuse it,<br/>

    revile it,<br/>

    depreciate<br/>

    and cripple it.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, sir, other recluses and brahmins,<br/>

    on coming to Kesaputta,<br/>

    do likewise.</p>

    <p class="f4">When we listen to them, sir,<br/>

    we have doubt and wavering<br/>

    as to which of these worthies is speaking truth<br/>

    and which speaks falsehood."</p>

    <p class="f4">3. "Yes, Kālāmas, you may well doubt,<br/>

    you may well waver.</p>

    <p class="f4">In a doubtful matter wavering does arise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now look you, Kālāmas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye not misled by report<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    nor because it fits becoming,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    nor out of respect for a recluse (who bolds it).</p>

    <p class="f4">But, Kālāmas, when you know for yourselves:</p>

    <p class="f4">These things are unprofitable,<br/>

    these things are blameworthy,<br/>

    these things are censured by the intelligent;<br/>

    these things, when performed and undertaken,<br/>

    conduce to loss and sorrow, -</p>

    <p class="f4">then indeed do ye reject them, Kālāmas.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">4. Now what think ye, Kālāmas?</p>

    <p class="f4">When greed arises within a man,<br/>

    does it arise to his profit or to his loss?</p>

    <p class="f4">'To his loss, sir.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, Kālāmas, does not this man, thus become greedy,<br/>

    go after another's wife,<br/>

    <p class="f4">"Blameworthy, sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Are they censured by the intelligent or not?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"They are censured, sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"If performed and undertaken,<br/>

    do they conduce to loss and sorrow or not?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"They conduce to loss and sorrow, sir.</p>
