    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Sāvatthī was the occasion (for this conversation).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now one Channa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> a Wanderer,<br/>

    came to see the venerable Ānanda,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    greeted him courteously<br/>

    and, after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/>

    Channa the Wanderer said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend Ānanda, do you (people) preach<br/>

    the abandoning of passion,<br/>

    of malice<br/>

    and delusion?"</p>

    <p class="f4"> <span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span> "We do indeed, reverend sir."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Seeing what disadvantage therein<br/>

    do you preach<br/>

    the abandoning of passion,<br/>

    of malice<br/>

    and delusion?"</p>

    <p class="f4">2. "Why, sir, one who is overwhelmed by passion,<br/>

    losing control of mind,<br/>

    plans things which trouble himself,<br/>

    which trouble others,<br/>

    which trouble both himself and others,<br/>

    and so experiences<br/>

    mental suffering and dejection.</p>

    <p class="f4">But if passion be abandoned<br/>

    he does not lose control of mind,<br/>

    plan things which trouble himself,<br/>

    which trouble others,<br/>

    which trouble both himself and others,<br/>

    and so does not experience<br/>

    mental suffering and dejection.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, sir, one who is overwhelmed by passion<br/>

    practises immorality<br/>

    practises immorality in deed,<br/>

    practises immorality word<br/>

    practises immorality thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">But if passion be abandoned<br/>

    <p class="f4">Again, sir, passion is the cause of blindness,<br/>

    of not seeing,<br/>

    of not knowing,<br/>

    of loss of insight:<br/>

    it is joined with vexation,<br/>

    <p class="f4">One who is malicious<br/>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">

    <p>A nidana of some sort has frequently, but irregularly been inserted for this digital edition where each sutta should be able to stand alone and where the abrupt launching into a talk is jarring. Picking up the nidana of the first sutta in a chapter for the rest appears called for where the following suttas begin with 'Atha kho', 'There then'. Otherwise from the context and location of certain characters it is possible to deduce the nidana. Otherwise a generic beginning not specifying location has often, but not always been inserted.</p>
