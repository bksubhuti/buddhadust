    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī,<br/>

    in Great Grove,<br/>

    at the House with the Peaked Gable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat thus<br/>

    the Exalted One said this<br/>

    to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Ānanda, one for whom you have fellow-feeling<br/>

    and those who think you should be listened to,<br/>

    whether friends<br/>

    or intimates<br/>

    or kinsmen<br/>

    or blood relations, -<br/>

    such ought to be advised about,<br/>

    grounded on,<br/>

    established in three particulars.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Wbat three?</p>

    <p class="f4">2. They should be advised about,<br/>

    grounded on,<br/>

    established in<br/>

    unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is,<br/>

    the Exalted One,<br/>

    the Arahant,<br/>

    who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>

    perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>

    a Wellfarer,<br/>

    World-Knower,<br/>

    unsurpassed charioteer of beings to be tamed,<br/>

    Teacher of Devas and mankind,<br/>

    a Buddha is the Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">They should be advised about,<br/>

    grounded on,<br/>

    established in<br/>

    unwavering loyalty to Dhamma, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is a real thing, not a matter of time.</p>

    <p class="f4">It invites one to come and see it.</p>

    <p class="f4">It leads one onwards.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is to be understood by the intelligent for themselves.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">They should be advised about,<br/>

    grounded on,<br/>

    established in<br/>

    unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well conducted<br/>

    is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>

    walking uprightly<br/>

    is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>

    walking in the right way<br/>

    is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>

    walking dutifully<br/>

    is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>

    to wit, the four pairs of human beings,<br/>

    the eight sorts of human beings:<br/>

    that Order of disciples of the Exalted One<br/>

    is worthy of respect,<br/>

    offerings and gifts,<br/>

    worthy of being saluted with clasped hands,<br/>

    a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>
