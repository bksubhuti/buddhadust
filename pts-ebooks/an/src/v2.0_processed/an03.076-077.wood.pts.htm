    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[76.1][than][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was stayingnear Vesāli, in Gret Grove, at the House with the Peaked Gable.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat thus he said this to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to the saying<br/>

    'Becoming, becoming,'<br/>

    lord, pray to what extent is there becoming?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"If there were no worlds of sense-desire<br/>

    and no action to ripen therein, Ānanda,<br/>

    would any sensuous becoming be manifested?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"In this way, Ānanda,<br/>

    action is the field,<br/>

    consciousness is the seed,<br/>

    craving the moisture.</p>

    and no action to ripen therein,<br/>

    would any formal becoming be manifested?"</p>
