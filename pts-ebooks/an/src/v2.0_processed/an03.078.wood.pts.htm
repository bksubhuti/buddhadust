    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī,<br/>

    in Great Grove,<br/>

    at the House with the Peaked Gable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat thus<br/>

    the Exalted One said this<br/>

    to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What think you, Ānanda?</p>

    <p class="f4">Will every sort of moral practice,<br/>

    way of living,<br/>

    sanctity of life<br/>

    and excellence of service<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    have a like fruit hereafter?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I would not say, lord,<br/>

    that it is inevitably so."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, then, do you go into particulars."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"For instance, lord,<br/>

    that moral practice,<br/>

    way of living,<br/>

    sanctity of life<br/>

    and excellence of service<br/>

    which increase unprofitable states<br/>

    and decrease profitable states<br/>

    in him who observes <span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span> them, -<br/>

    such moral practice,<br/>

    way of living,<br/>

    sanctity of life<br/>

    and excellence of service<br/>

    are without fruit.</p>

    <p class="f4">But,<br/>

    that moral practice,<br/>

    way of living,<br/>

    sanctity of life<br/>

    and excellence of service<br/>

    which increase profitable states<br/>

    and decrease unprofitable states<br/>

    in him who observes them, -<br/>

    such moral practice,<br/>

    way of living,<br/>

    sanctity of life<br/>

    and excellence of service<br/>

    do have this fruit."</p>

    <p class="f4">So said the venerable Ānanda<br/>

    and the Teacher agreed with him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Teacher agrees with me",<br/>

    rose up from his seat,<br/>

    saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/>

    and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now not long after the venerable Ānanda was gone<br/>

    the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, Ānanda is a learner.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet it would not be easy<br/>

    to find his equal in insight."</p>
