    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī,<br/>

    in Great Grove,<br/>

    at the House with the Peaked Gable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side he said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, there are these three sorts of scents<br/>

    whose savour spreads along with the wind,<br/>

    but not against the wind.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Root-scent,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    heart-wood scent<br/>

    and the scent of flowers.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three sorts of scents<br/>

    whose savour spreads along with the wind,<br/>

    but not against the wind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any sort of scent<br/>

    whose savour spreads with the wind,<br/>

    against the wind<br/>

    and both ways alike?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is such a scent, Ānanda."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is that scent, lord?"</p>

    <p class="f4">2. "In this connexion, Ānanda,<br/>

    in whatsoever village or district<br/>

    there is a woman or a man<br/>

    who has taken refuge in the Buddha,<br/>

    and the Order,<br/>

    who abstains from slaying,<br/>

    of such an one<br/>

    recluses and hermits sing the praises<br/>

    in all quarters, thus:</p>
