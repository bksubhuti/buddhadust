    <h1>Recital (b)</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, this recital to be made twice a month<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span> amounts to more than one hundred and fifty rules<br/>

    wherein are trained<br/>

    clansmen who are eager for their welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now all these combine together<br/>

    to make these three forms of training.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">The higher morality,<br/>

    the higher thought<br/>

    and the higher insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein are combined<br/>

    one and all of these rules.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">2. Now, Monks, in this matter<br/>

    a monk keeps the laws of morality in full,<br/>

    he is moderately given to mental concentration,<br/>

    moderately given to striving for insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever minor, trifling observances<br/>

    he may transgress,<br/>

    he is cleared of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">I do not declare him<br/>

    to be rendered unfit because of them,<br/>

    for he strictly observes<br/>

    the rudiments of the holy life,<br/>

    the constituents of the holy life:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is established in morality,<br/>

    he trains himself in the rules of training<br/>

    by undertaking them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such an one,<br/>

    by destroying three fetters<br/>

    is a stream-winner,<br/>

    is destined to seven more births at most:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    seven times more at most<br/>

    he fares and wanders up and down<br/>

    among devas and mankind<br/>

    and then makes an end of Ill.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, such an one again,<br/>

    by destroying three fetters,<br/>

    is reborn in a good family.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He fares and wanders up and down<br/>

    in two or three families<br/>

    and then makes an end of Ill.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, such an one again,<br/>

    by destroying three fetters,<br/>

    is a "one-seeder":<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    he just takes one rebirth as a man<br/>

    and then makes an end of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This monk, by destroying three fetters<br/>

    and weakening those of lust,<br/>

    malice<br/>

    and delusion,<br/>

    is a once-returner.</p>

    <p class="f4">He comes back to this world<br/>

    only once and makes an end of Ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">3. Again, Monks, in this matter<br/>

    a monk keeps the laws of morality in full,<br/>

    he practises concentration in full,<br/>

    but he is moderately given to striving for insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever minor, trifling observances<br/>

    he may transgress,<br/>

    he is cleared of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">I do not declare him<br/>

    to be rendered unfit because of them,<br/>

    for he strictly observes<br/>

    the rudiments of the holy life,<br/>

    the constituents of the holy life:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is established in morality,<br/>

    he trains himself in the rules of training<br/>

    by undertaking them.</p>

    <p class="f4">By destroying the five fetters<br/>

    binding to rebirth (in the lower worlds)<br/>

    he is "one who goes upstream,"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    he goes to the Pure Abodes.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, by destroying these five fetters,<br/>

    he attains release without much trouble.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, by destroying these five fetters,<br/>

    he attains release with some little trouble.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, by destroying these five fetters,<br/>

    he attains release by reduction of his time.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, by destroying these five fetters,<br/>

    he attains release midway.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">4. Again, monks, a monk keeps the laws of morality in full,<br/>

    he practises concentration in full,<br/>

    he practises the acquiring of insight in full.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever minor, trifling observances<br/>

    he may transgress,<br/>

    he is cleared of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">I do not declare him<br/>

    to be rendered unfit because of them,<br/>

    for he strictly observes<br/>

    the rudiments of the holy life,<br/>

    the constituents of the holy life:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is established in morality,<br/>

    he trains himself in the rules of training<br/>

    by undertaking them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such an one, by destroying the āsavas,<br/>

    in this very life<br/>

    himself knowing it thoroughly<br/>

    realizes the heart's release,<br/>

    the release by insight,<br/>

    and attaining it<br/>

    abides therein.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span> Thus, monks, the partial fulfiller (of observances)<br/>

    attains partially:<br/>

    the perfect observer<br/>

    attains in full.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not barren of result<br/>

    are these rules of the training,<br/>

    I declare."</p>
