    <h1>Training (a)</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three forms of training.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span> The training in the higher morality,<br/>

    that in the higher thought<br/>

    and that in the higher insight.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher morality?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk lives virtuous,<br/>

    restrained with the restraint of the obligations;<br/>

    proficient in following the practice of right conduct<br/>

    he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br/>

    he takes up and trains himself<br/>

    in the rules of morality.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/>

    'the training in the higher morality.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher thought?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk, remote from sensual desires,<br/>

    aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br/>

    enters on the first musing<br/>

    which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    born of seclusion,<br/>

    zestful and easeful,<br/>

    and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    he enters on that inward calm,<br/>

    that single-minded purpose,<br/>

    apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    born of mental balance,<br/>

    zestful and easeful,<br/>

    which is the second musing,<br/>

    and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br/>

    he becomes balanced<br/>

    and remains mindful and composed,<br/>

    and experiences with the body<br/>

    that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,'</p>

    <p class="f4">and he enters on the third musing<br/>

    and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br/>

    by the coming to an end<br/>

    of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>

    free of pain and free of pleasure,<br/>

    a state of perfect purity<br/>

    of balance and equanimity.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/>

    'the training in the higher thought.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher insight?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk understands, as it really is, the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ending of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice leading to the ending of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/>

    'the training in the higher insight.'</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three forms of training."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>A better approach would be to change the translation of 'citta'. "Heart" This is training in serenity [<i>samādhi</i>] which is more a state of the heart than of the mind.</p>
