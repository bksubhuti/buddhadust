    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three urgent<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> duties of a yeoman farmer.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the yeoman farmer<br/>

    gets his field well ploughed and harrowed<br/>

    very quickly.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having done so<br/>

    he puts in his seed<br/>

    very quickly.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having done that<br/>

    he lets the water in<br/>

    and turns it off<br/>

    very quickly.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are his three urgent duties.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, that yeoman farmer<br/>

    has no such magic power or authority<br/>

    as to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let my crops spring up today.</p>

    <p class="f4">Tomorrow let them ear.</p>

    <p class="f4">On the following day let them ripen.'</p>

    <p class="f4">No!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just the due season<br/>

    which makes them do this.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">2. In the same way<br/>

    there are these three urgent duties of a monk.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">The undertaking of the training<br/>

    in the higher morality,<br/>

    in the higher thought<br/>

    and in the higher insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are his three urgent duties.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the monk<br/>

    has no such magic power or authority<br/>

    as to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Today let my mind be released from the āsavas without grasping,<br/>

    or tomorrow,<br/>

    or the day following.'</p>

    <p class="f4">No!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just the due season<br/>

    which releases his mind,<br/>

    as he undergoes the training<br/>

    in the higher morality,<br/>

    in the higher thought<br/>

    and in the higher insight.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span> Wherefore, monks,<br/>

    thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Keen shall be our desire<br/>

    to undertake the training<br/>

    in the higher morality,<br/>

    in the higher thought<br/>

    and in the higher insight.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how ye must train yourselves."</p>
