    <h1>Aloofness</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, the Wanderers holding other views<br/>

    enjoin these three forms of aloofness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Aloofness from robes,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    from alms-food,<br/>

    from lodging.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now in the matter of aloofness from robes<br/>

    the Wanderers holding other views<br/>

    enjoin the wearing of coarse, hempen clothes,<br/>

    clothes of different<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> fibres,<br/>

    discarded corpse-cloths,<br/>

    rags from a rubbish-heap,<br/>

    tree-bark fibre,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    antelope skins,<br/>

    strips of antelope skins,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    clothes made of kusa-grass,<br/>

    made of wood-shavings.</p>

    <p class="f4">They wear blankets made of human hair,<br/>

    made of horse hair,<br/>

    made of owls' wings.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the practice they enjoin<br/>

    as regards robes.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then in the matter of aloofness<br/>

    as regards alms-food:</p>

    <p class="f4">They feed on vegetables,<br/>

    millet,<br/>

    raw rice,<br/>

    wild rice,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    water-plants,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    rice-powder,<br/>

    burnt scum of rice,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

    flour of oil-seeds,<br/>

    on grass<br/>

    and cowdung.</p>

    <p class="f4">They keep themselves alive<br/>

    by eating forest roots and fruit,<br/>

    and fruit that has fallen.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is their practice<br/>

    as regards aloofness from alms-food.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br/>

    the Wanderers holding other views<br/>

    enjoin in respect of aloofness from lodging:</p>

    <p class="f4">Dwelling in a forest<br/>

    at the root of a tree,<br/>

    in a cemetery,<br/>

    in a lonely jungle-glade,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    in the open air,<br/>

    on a heap of straw,<br/>

    in a thatched <span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span> shelter.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such ways of dwelling do they enjoin.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three injunctions<br/>

    of the Wanderers holding other views.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">2. Now, monks, there are these three forms of aloofness<br/>

    for a monk under this Dhamma-Discipline.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk is moral,<br/>

    he has abandoned immorality,<br/>

    from that he is aloof.</p>

    <p class="f4">He has right view,<br/>

    he has abandoned wrong view,<br/>

    from that he is aloof.</p>

    <p class="f4">He has destroyed the āsavas,<br/>

    the āsavas are abandoned by him,<br/>

    from them he is aloof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now in these three sorts of aloofness<br/>

    this monk is called:</p>

    <p class="f4">'One who has reached perfection,'<br/>

    'one who has reached the essential,'<br/>

    'one who is set firm in the essential.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">3. Suppose, monks, a yeoman farmer's<br/>

    field of paddy<br/>

    is in good order.</p>
