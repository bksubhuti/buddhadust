    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Before my enlightenment, monks,<br/>

    when I was yet but a Bodhisat,<br/>

    this occurred to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What, I wonder,<br/>

    is the satisfaction in the world,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    what is the misery in the world,<br/>

    what is the escape therefrom?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, this occurred to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That condition in the world<br/>

    owing to which pleasure arises,<br/>

    owing to which arises happiness, -<br/>

    that is the satisfaction in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">That impermanence,<br/>

    that suffering,<br/>

    that changeability in the world, -<br/>

    that is the misery in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">That restraint,<br/>

    that riddance of desire and passion in the world,<br/>

    that is the escape therefrom.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    unsurpassed in the world<br/>

    with its devas,<br/>

    its Maras and Brahmās,<br/>

    together with the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>

    of devas and mankind.</p>
