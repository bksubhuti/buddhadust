    <h1>Satisfaction</h1>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[238]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now herein,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> monks,<br/>

    if there were not satisfaction to be found in the world,<br/>

    beings would not be attached to the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">But since there is satisfaction in the world,<br/>

    beings are attached thereto.</p>

    <p class="f4">If there were not misery in the world,<br/>

    beings would not be repelled by the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">But since there is misery in the world,<br/>

    beings are repelled by the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">If there were no escape from the world,<br/>

    beings could not escape therefrom.</p>

    <p class="f4">But since there is an escape from the world,<br/>

    beings do escape therefrom.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, in so far as beings have not fully come to know,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the satisfaction in the world as such,<br/>

    the misery therein as misery,<br/>

    the escape therefrom as such,<br/>

    just so far have they not dwelt free from,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    detached from,<br/>

    released from,<br/>

    with heart unconfined by<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    the world<br/>

    and the devas,<br/>

    the Maras,<br/>

    and Brahmās,<br/>

    together with the host of recluses and brahmins<br/>

    of devas and mankind.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, when beings have fully come to know,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the satisfaction in the world as such,<br/>

    the misery in the world as such,<br/>

    the escape from the world as such, -<br/>

    then, monks, they dwell free,<br/>

    detached,<br/>

    released from,<br/>

    with heart unconfined by the world<br/>

    and the devas,<br/>

    the Maras,<br/>

    and Brahmās,<br/>

    together with the host of recluses and brahmins<br/>

    of devas and mankind.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> under- <span class="f2 g"><b>[239]</b></span> stand not,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the satisfaction,<br/>

    the misery in the world,<br/>

    and the escape therefrom,<br/>

    such recluses and brahmins<br/>

    in my opinion<br/>

    are not to be regarded as recluses<br/>

    among recluses,<br/>

    nor as brahmins<br/>

    among brahmins:<br/>

    nor have those worthies come to know<br/>

    fully of themselves<br/>

    in this very life<br/>

    the real meaning of recluseship<br/>

    or of brahminhood,<br/>

    nor attaining thereto<br/>

    do they dwell therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, whatsoever recluses and brahmins<br/>

    do so understandas it really is,<br/>

    the satisfaction,<br/>

    the misery in the world,<br/>

    and the escape therefrom,<br/>

    such recluses and brahmins<br/>

    are in my opinion<br/>

    to be regarded as recluses<br/>

    among recluses,<br/>

    as brahmins<br/>

    among brahmins:<br/>

    and those worthies have come to know<br/>

    fully of themselves<br/>

    in this very life<br/>

    the real meaning of recluseship<br/>

    or of brahminhood,<br/>

    and attaining thereto<br/>

    they dwell therein."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
