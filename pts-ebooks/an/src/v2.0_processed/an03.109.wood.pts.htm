    <h1>Three Causes (c)</h1>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three causes of the origin of actions.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Desire is generated<br/>

    for things which in the past<br/>

    were based on desire.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Desire is generated<br/>

    for things in the future,<br/>

    based on desire.</p>

    <p class="f4">Desire is generated<br/>

    for things in the present,<br/>

    based on desire.</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">2. And how, monks, is this desire generated<br/>

    for things in the past which were based on desire?</p>

    <p class="f4">One remembers<br/>

    and turns over in his mind<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    thoughts about things<br/>

    based on desire in the past.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he does so<br/>

    desire is generated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Become desirous,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    he is fettered by those things.</p>

    <p class="f4">I call this a fetter, monks, -<br/>

    that heart full of lust.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That is how desire is generated<br/>

    for things which in the past<br/>

    were based on desire.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">3. And how, monks, is this desire generated<br/>

    for things in the future<br/>

    based on desire?</p>

    <p class="f4">One thinks about<br/>

    and turns over in his mind<br/>

    thoughts of things<br/>

    based on desire in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he does so,<br/>

    desire is generated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Become desirous,<br/>

    he is fettered by those things.</p>

    <p class="f4">I call this a fetter, monks, -<br/>

    that heart full of lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how desire is generated<br/>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">4. And how, monks, is this desire generated<br/>

    for things in the present<br/>

    based on desire?</p>

    <p class="f4">One thinks about things<br/>

    and turns over in his mind<br/>

    thoughts of things<br/>

    based on desire in the present.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he does <span class="f2 g"><b>[243]</b></span> so, desire is generated.</p>
