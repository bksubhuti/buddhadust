    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, the appearance of three persons<br/>

    is hard to find in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">The appearance of a Tathāgata,<br/>

    an Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One<br/>

    is hard to be found in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">The appearance of a person<br/>

    who can expound the Dhamma-Discipline<br/>

    taught by the Tathāgata<br/>

    is hard to be found in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">The appearance of a person<br/>

    who is mindful and grateful<br/>

    is hard to be found in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three persons<br/>

    hard to find in the world."</p>
