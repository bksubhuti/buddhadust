    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three failures.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Failure in action,<br/>

    failure in livelihood,<br/>

    failure in view.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[249]</b></span> And of what sort<br/>

    is failure in action?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one<br/>

    takes life,<br/>

    steals,<br/>

    is a wrongdoer in sensual desires,<br/>

    a liar,<br/>

    a slanderer,<br/>

    of bitter speech,<br/>

    an idle babbler.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called 'failure in action.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">2. And of what sort<br/>

    is failure in livelihood?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one<br/>

    is a wrong liver,<br/>

    gets a livelihood in a wrong way.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/>

    'failure in livelihood.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">3. And of what sort<br/>

    is failure in view?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a certain one<br/>

    holds the depraved,<br/>

    the perverse view<br/>

    that there is no (virtue in) almsgiving,<br/>

    in sacrifice,<br/>

    in offerings:<br/>

    that there is no fruit,<br/>

    no result<br/>

    of good and evil deeds:<br/>

    that this world is not,<br/>

    that there is no world beyond:<br/>

    that there is no mother,<br/>

    no father,<br/>

    no beings of spontaneous birth:<br/>

    that in the world are no recluses and brahmins<br/>

    who have won the summit,<br/>

    who have won perfection,<br/>

    who of themselves<br/>

    by their own intuitional powers<br/>

    have realized the world beyond<br/>

    and can proclaim it.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    'failure in view.'</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three failures.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">4. Monks, there are these three successes.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Success in action,<br/>

    success in livelihood,<br/>

    success in view.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now of what sort<br/>

    is success in action?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one<br/>

    abstains from taking life<br/>

    abstains from stealing,<br/>

    abstains from wrongdoing in sensual desires,<br/>

    abstains from lies,<br/>

    abstains from slander,<br/>

    abstains from bitter speech,<br/>

    abstains from idle babble.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/>

    is a right liver,<br/>

    he gets a livelihood in a right way.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/>

    'success in livelihood.'</p>

    <p class="f4">7. And of what sort<br/>

    is success in view?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a certain one has right view:<br/>

    he holds with certainty<br/>

    that there is (virtue in) almsgiving,<br/>

    in sacrifice,<br/>

    in offerings:<br/>

    that there is fruit and result<br/>

    of good and evil deeds:<br/>

    that this world is,<br/>

    that there is a world beyond:<br/>

    that mother,<br/>

    father<br/>

    and beings of spontaneous birth do exist:<br/>

    that in the world there are recluses and brahmins<br/>

    who have won the summit,<br/>

    who have won perfection,<br/>

    who of themselves<br/>

    by their own intuitional powers<br/>
