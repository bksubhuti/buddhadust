    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three forms of<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> purity.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Purity of body,<br/>

    purity of speech,<br/>

    purity of mind.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">2. And of what sort is purity of body?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk abstains from taking life,<br/>

    from stealing,<br/>

    from sinful<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> living.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called 'purity of body.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">3. And of what sort is purity of speech?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a certain one<br/>

    abstains from falsehood,<br/>

    slander,<br/>

    bitter speech,<br/>

    idle babble.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/>

    'purity of speech.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">4. And of what sort is purity of mind?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk, if he have some personal sensual desire, is aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is in me personal sensual desire.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If there be no personal sensual desire, is aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is in me no personal sensual desire.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Also he is aware of how the arising of sensual desire not yet arisen comes about,<br/>

    and how it is abandoned when arisen,<br/>

    and how in the future there is no such arising.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

    <p class="f4">7. If he have some personal excitement-and-flurry, he is aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is within me personal excitement-and-flurry.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If there be no personal excitement-and-flurry, is aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is in me no personal excitement-and-flurry.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Also he is aware of how the arising of excitement-and-flurry not yet arisen comes about,<br/>

    and how in the future there is no such arising.</p>

    <p class="f4">8. If he have some personal doubt-and-wavering, he is aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is within me personal doubt-and-wavering.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If there be no personal doubt-and-wavering, is aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is in me no personal doubt-and-wavering.'</p>
