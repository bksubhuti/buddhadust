    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In whatsoever quarter<br/>

    the monks dwell in strife and uproar,<br/>

    given to disputes<br/>

    and wounding each other<br/>

    with the weapons of the tongue,<br/>

    it is unpleasant for me<br/>

    even to think of such a quarter,<br/>

    much more unpleasant for me to go to it.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span> I come to this conclusion<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> in the matter:</p>
