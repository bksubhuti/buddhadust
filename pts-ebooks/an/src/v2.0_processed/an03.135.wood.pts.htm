    <h1>Hair-Blanket</h1>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, just as the hair-blanket<br/>

    is reckoned the meanest<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    of all woven garments whatsoever,<br/>

    — for, monks, the hair-blanket<br/>

    is cold in cold weather,<br/>

    hot in hot weather,<br/>

    ill-coloured,<br/>

    foul-smelling<br/>

    and unpleasant to touch,<br/>

    — even so, of all theories<br/>

    put forward by recluses,<br/>

    that of Makkhali<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    is the meanest.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Makkhali, monks, infatuated man,<br/>

    thus proclaims, holds this view:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is no doing of a deed;<br/>

    there is nothing done<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> thereby;<br/>

    there is no energy to do.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[2][olds]</span> Now, monks, all those<br/>

    who in time past were Arahants,<br/>

    who were Fully Enlightened Ones,<br/>

    all those Exalted Ones<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[266]</b></span> were teachers of the deed,<br/>

    teachers of the efficacy of the deed,<br/>

    of energy to do.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, Makkhali, infatuated man,<br/>

    excludes<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> all of them<br/>

    by his doctrine of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is no doing of a deed:<br/>

    there is nothing done thereby:<br/>

    there is no energy to do.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[3][olds]</span> Now, monks, all those<br/>

    who in future time shall be Arahants,<br/>

    who were Fully Enlightened Ones,<br/>

    all those Exalted Ones<br/>

    were teachers of the deed,<br/>

    teachers of the efficacy of the deed,<br/>

    of energy to do.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, Makkhali, infatuated man,<br/>

    excludes all of them<br/>

    by his doctrine of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is no doing of a deed:<br/>

    there is nothing done thereby:<br/>

    there is no energy to do.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[4][olds]</span> Nay, I myself who am now Arahant,<br/>

    a Fully Enlightened One,<br/>

    I am a teacher of the deed,<br/>

    of the efficacy of the deed,<br/>

    of energy to do.</p>

    <p class="f4">Me also does Makkhali, infatuated man,<br/>

    exclude by his doctrine of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is no doing of a deed:<br/>

    there is nothing done thereby:<br/>

    there is no energy to do.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[5][olds]</span> Just as if, monks,<br/>

    at the mouth of a river<br/>

    a man should set<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> a fish-trap<br/>

    to the loss, misery, distress<br/>

    and destruction of many fish,<br/>

    even so does Makkhali, that infatuated man,<br/>

    set a man-trap, methinks,<br/>

    for the loss, misery, distress<br/>

    and destruction of many men."</p>
