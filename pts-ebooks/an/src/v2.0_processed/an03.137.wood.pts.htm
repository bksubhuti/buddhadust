    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you<br/>

    the three colts among horses<br/>

    and the three colts among men.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Apply your minds earnestly<br/>

    and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, monks, what are the three colts among horses?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[267]</b></span> Herein a certain colt<br/>

    is gifted with speed,<br/>

    but not gifted with beauty,<br/>

    not with gifted good proportions.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein also a colt<br/>

    is gifted with speed,<br/>

    gifted with beauty,<br/>

    but not gifted with good proportions.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise we have a certain colt<br/>

    gifted with speed,<br/>

    gifted with beauty,<br/>

    and gifted with good proportions.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three sorts of colt.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">2. Now, monks, what are the three colts among men?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein we have a certain young man<br/>

    gifted with speed,<br/>

    but not gifted with beauty,<br/>

    not with gifted good proportions.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein we have a certain young man<br/>

    gifted with speed,<br/>

    gifted with beauty,<br/>

    but not gifted with good proportions.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise we have a certain young man<br/>

    gifted with speed,<br/>

    gifted with beauty,<br/>

    and gifted with good proportions.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">3. Now how is a young man<br/>

    gifted with speed<br/>

    but not gifted with beauty,<br/>

    not gifted with good proportions?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk knows, as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ending of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice leading to the ending of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This discrimination I call his 'speed.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">But if he be asked a question<br/>

    about extra doctrine<br/>

    or extra discipline,<br/>

    he falters,<br/>

    he cannot solve it.</p>

    <p class="f4">This failure I call his 'lack of beauty.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And suppose that he fails to get offerings<br/>

    of robes and alms-food,<br/>

    lodging,<br/>

    extras<br/>

    and necessary medicines.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This I call his 'lack of good proportions.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus we have among men<br/>

    a colt gifted with speed,<br/>

    but not gifted in beauty<br/>

    and not gifted in good proportions.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">4. And how is a young man<br/>

    gifted with speed<br/>

    and gifted with beauty<br/>

    but not gifted in good proportions?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk knows, as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ending of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice leading to the ending of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This discrimination I call his 'speed.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">When he is put a question<br/>

    on extra doctrine and extra discipline,<br/>

    he solves it,<br/>

    he does not falter.</p>

    <p class="f4">This I call his 'gift of beauty.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet he fails to get offerings<br/>

    of robes and alms-food,<br/>

    lodging,<br/>

    extras<br/>

    and necessary medicines.</p>

    <p class="f4">This I call his 'lack of good proportions.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus we have among men a colt<br/>

    gifted with speed<br/>

    and gifted with beauty<br/>

    but not gifted in good proportions</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">5. And how is a young man<br/>

    gifted with speed<br/>

    and gifted with beauty<br/>

    and gifted in good proportions?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk knows, as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ending of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice leading to the ending of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This discrimination I call his 'speed.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">When he is put a question<br/>

    on extra doctrine and extra discipline,<br/>

    he solves it,<br/>

    he does not falter.</p>

    <p class="f4">This I call his 'gift of beauty.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein he does not fail to get offerings<br/>

    of robes and alms-food,<br/>

    lodging,<br/>

    extras<br/>

    and necessary medicines.</p>

    <p class="f4">This I call his 'gift of good proportions.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way, monks, a colt among men is<br/>

    gifted with speed<br/>

    and gifted with beauty<br/>

    and gifted in good proportions</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three sorts of colt among men."</p>
