    <p><span class="f2">[1]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[1]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Vajjians, at Bhaṇḍagāma.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, it is through not understanding,<br/>

    through not penetrating four things<br/>

    that we have thus gone on faring,<br/>

    thus gone on running<br/>

    this long time,<br/>

    both you and I.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four things?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is through not understanding,<br/>

    through not penetrating the Ariyan virtue, monks,<br/>

    the Ariyan concentration,<br/>

    the Ariyan wisdom:<br/>

    it is through not understanding,<br/>

    not penetrating the Ariyan release<br/>

    that we have thus gone on faring,<br/>

    thus gone on running<br/>

    this long time,<br/>

    both you and I.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, when the Ariyan virtue,<br/>

    the Ariyan concentration,<br/>

    the Ariyan wisdom<br/>

    and the Ariyan release<br/>

    are understood and penetrated,<br/>

    cut off is the craving for becoming,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span> destroyed is the cord of becoming,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    there is now no more again of becoming.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">So saying the Wellfarer added this further as Teacher:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'Virtue and concentration, wisdom, release<br/>

    Beyond compare, - these things by Gotama<br/>

    Of famous name were fully understood.<br/>

    Thus, fully comprehending them, the Buddha,<br/>

    Ender of ill, Teacher with opened eyes,<br/>

    Utterly calmed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> taught Dhamma to the monks.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="demi" />

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>D.</i> ii, 122 (<i>M. Parinibbdna Sutta</i>). 'Becoming' stands at once for state, place and duration. The village seems not to be named elsewhere.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Bhava-netti = rajju,</i> 'by which beings are, like cattle, tied together by the neck, led on to such and such becoming.' <i>Comy.</i> In the <i>sutta</i> at D. ii (Koṭigāma) it is the penetration of the Four Truths which leads to this result, the words of the <i>gāthā</i> there being similar to those of our last §.</p>
