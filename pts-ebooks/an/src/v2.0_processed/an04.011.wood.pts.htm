    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if while he walks<br/>

    there arise in a monk thoughts sensual or malign or cruel,<br/>

    and that monk admits them,<br/>

    does not reject and expel them,<br/>

    does not make an end of them,<br/>

    does not drive them out of renewed existence,<br/>

    a monk who while walking becomes thus is called:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Void of zeal and unscrupulous,<br/>

    always and for ever sluggish<br/>

    and poor in energy."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The uddana-title of this vagga is derived from § i, <i>caraṃ</i> (really 'walking'), which embraces the four bodily postures. The sutta occurs at <i>Itiv.</i> 115, where the readings of our text of <i>ce</i> after <i>caraṃ, ṭhito, nisinno</i> are rightly omitted; so also in <i>Sinh.</i> text.</p>
