    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four efforts.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The effort to restrain,<br/>

    the effort to abandon,<br/>

    the effort to make become,<br/>

    and the effort to watch over.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the effort to restrain?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> a monk, seeing an object with the eye,<br/>

    is not entranced by its general features<br/>

    or by its details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Inasmuch as coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil,<br/>

    unprofitable states,<br/>

    might flow in upon one<br/>

    who dwells with this eye-faculty uncontrolled,<br/>

    he applies himself to such control,<br/>

    sets a guard over the eye-faculty,<br/>

    wins the restraint thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the <span class="f2 g"><b>[16]</b></span> ear,<br/>

    is not entranced by its general features<br/>

    or by its details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Inasmuch as coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil,<br/>

    unprofitable states,<br/>

    might flow in upon one<br/>

    who dwells with this ear-faculty uncontrolled,<br/>

    he applies himself to such control,<br/>

    sets a guard over the ear-faculty,<br/>

    wins the restraint thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or with the nose smelling an odour,<br/>

    is not entranced by its general features<br/>

    or by its details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Inasmuch as coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil,<br/>

    unprofitable states,<br/>

    might flow in upon one<br/>

    who dwells with this nose-faculty uncontrolled,<br/>

    he applies himself to such control,<br/>

    sets a guard over the nose-faculty,<br/>

    wins the restraint thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or with the tongue tasting a savour,<br/>

    is not entranced by its general features<br/>

    or by its details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Inasmuch as coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil,<br/>

    unprofitable states,<br/>

    he applies himself to such control,<br/>

    sets a guard over the tongue-faculty,<br/>

    wins the restraint thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or with body contacting tangibles,<br/>

    is not entranced by its general features<br/>

    or by its details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Inasmuch as coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil,<br/>

    unprofitable states,<br/>

    might flow in upon one<br/>

    who dwells with this body-faculty uncontrolled,<br/>

    he applies himself to such control,<br/>

    sets a guard over the body-faculty,<br/>

    wins the restraint thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or with mind cognizing mental states,<br/>

    is not entranced by its general features<br/>

    or by its details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Inasmuch as coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil,<br/>

    unprofitable states,<br/>

    sets a guard over the mind-faculty,<br/>

    wins the restraint thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the effort to restrain."</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the effort to abandon?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk does not admit sensual thought that has arisen,<br/>

    but abandons it,<br/>

    expels it,<br/>

    makes an end of it,<br/>

    drives it out of renewed existence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk does not admit malign and cruel thought that has arisen,<br/>

    but abandons it,<br/>

    expels it,<br/>

    makes an end of it,<br/>

    drives it out of renewed existence.</p>

    <p class="f4">He does not admit evil, unprofitable states that arise from time to time,<br/>

    but abandons them,<br/>

    expels them,<br/>

    makes an end of them,<br/>

    drives them out of renewed existence</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the effort to abandon."</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort is<br/>

    the effort to make become?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk makes to become<br/>

    the limb of wisdom<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> that is mindfulness,<br/>

    that is based on seclusion,<br/>

    on dispassion,<br/>

    on ending,<br/>

    that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He makes to become<br/>

    the limb of wisdom that is investigation of Dhamma,<br/>

    that is based on seclusion,<br/>

    on dispassion,<br/>

    on ending,<br/>

    that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He makes to become<br/>

    the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>

    that is based on seclusion,<br/>

    on dispassion,<br/>

    on ending,<br/>

    that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He makes to become<br/>

    the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/>

    that is based on seclusion,<br/>

    on dispassion,<br/>

    on ending,<br/>

    <p class="f4">He makes to become<br/>

    the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>

    that is based on seclusion,<br/>

    on dispassion,<br/>

    on ending,<br/>

    that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He makes to become<br/>

    the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>

    that is based on seclusion,<br/>

    on dispassion,<br/>

    on ending,<br/>

    that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He makes to become<br/>

    the limb of wisdom that is equanimity,<br/>

    that is based on seclusion,<br/>

    on dispassion,<br/>

    on ending,<br/>

    that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the effort to make become."</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the effort to watch over?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk watches over the favourable concentration-mark,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    the idea of the skeleton,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    the idea of the worm-eaten <span class="f2 g"><b>[17]</b></span> corpse,<br/>

    of the discoloured corpse,<br/>

    of the fissured corpse,<br/>

    the idea of the inflated corpse.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called "the effort to watch over."</p>

    <p class="f4">These then, monks, are the four efforts.</p>

    <p class="f4">Restraint, abandoning, making-become, watching o'er,<br/>

    These are the four (best) efforts taught by him,<br/>
