    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four powers over the subtle.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk is possessed of the power to penetrate the <span class="f2 g"><b>[18]</b></span> subtilty of body,<br/>

    and be beholds not any other power<br/>

    more excellent or more refined than that one;<br/>

    he aspires not for any other power<br/>

    to penetrate the subtilty of body<br/>

    more excellent and refined than that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is possessed of the power to penetrate the subtilty of feeling,<br/>

    and be beholds not any other power<br/>

    more excellent or more refined than that one;<br/>

    he aspires not for any other power<br/>

    to penetrate the subtilty of feeling<br/>

    more excellent and refined than that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is possessed of the power to penetrate the subtilty of perception,<br/>

    and be beholds not any other power<br/>

    more excellent or more refined than that one;<br/>

    he aspires not for any other power<br/>

    to penetrate the subtilty of perception<br/>

    more excellent and refined than that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is possessed of the power to penetrate the subtilty of the activities,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>,<br/>

    and be beholds not any other power<br/>

    more excellent or more refined than that one;<br/>

    he aspires not for any other power<br/>

    to penetrate the subtilty of the activities<br/>

    more excellent and refined than that.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Knowing the subtilty of form and knowing<br/>

    How feelings come to be, and whence arises<br/>

    Perception, how it ends, knowing th' activities<br/>

    As other and as ill, but not as self:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    (These things) if he do see aright, the monk,<br/>

    At peace, delighting in the place of peace,<br/>

    Beareth the final body (in the world),<br/>

    For he hath conquered Mara and his mount.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>
