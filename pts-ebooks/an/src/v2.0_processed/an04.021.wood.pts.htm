    <p><span class="f2">[20]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[20]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'On a certain occasion, monks, I myself was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjarā,<br/>

    under the Goatherds' Banyan,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    just after I had become perfectly enlightened.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me then occurred this thought as I was meditating alone:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Ill at ease dwells the man who reverences not, obeys not.</p>

    <p class="f4">What if<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> I were to dwell<br/>

    doing honour<br/>

    and paying reverence<br/>

    to some recluse or brahmin,<br/>

    and serving him?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, it was I who had this thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"For the perfection<br/>

    of the sum total of virtues<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> still imperfect<br/>

    I would dwell so doing honour,<br/>

    obeying,<br/>

    reverencing<br/>

    and serving a recluse or brahmin:<br/>

    but not in this world<br/>

    with devas,<br/>

    Maras,<br/>

    Brahmas,<br/>

    not in the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>

    not in the world of devas and mankind<br/>

    do I behold any other recluse or brahmin<br/>

    more perfect in virtue than myself,<br/>

    whom honouring<br/>

    I could dwell reverencing,<br/>

    obeying<br/>

    and serving him.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the perfection of the sum total of concentration still imperfect<br/>

    I would dwell so doing honour,<br/>

    obeying,<br/>

    reverencing<br/>

    and serving a recluse or brahmin:<br/>

    but not in this world<br/>

    with devas,<br/>

    not in the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>

    not in the world of devas and mankind<br/>

    do I behold any other recluse or brahmin<br/>

    more perfect in concentration than myself,<br/>

    whom honouring<br/>

    I could dwell reverencing,<br/>

    obeying<br/>

    and serving him.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the perfection of the sum total of wisdom still imperfect<br/>

    I would dwell so doing honour,<br/>

    obeying,<br/>

    reverencing<br/>

    and serving a recluse or brahmin:<br/>

    but not in this world<br/>

    with devas,<br/>

    Maras,<br/>

    Brahmas,<br/>

    not in the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>

    not in the world of devas and mankind<br/>

    do I behold any other recluse or brahmin<br/>

    more perfect in wisdom than myself,<br/>

    whom honouring<br/>

    I could dwell reverencing,<br/>

    obeying<br/>

    and serving him.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the perfection of the sum total of release still imperfect<br/>

    I would dwell so doing honour,<br/>

    obeying,<br/>

    reverencing<br/>

    and serving a recluse or brahmin:<br/>

    but not in this world<br/>

    with devas,<br/>

    Maras,<br/>

    Brahmas,<br/>

    not in the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>

    not in the world of devas and mankind<br/>

    do I behold any other recluse or brahmin<br/>

    more perfect in release than myself,<br/>

    whom honouring<br/>

    I could dwell reverencing,<br/>

    obeying<br/>

    and serving him.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[21]</b></span> Then, monks, it was I who had this thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose this Dhamma<br/>

    in which I have been perfectly enlightened, -<br/>

    suppose I were to dwell honouring,<br/>

    reverencing,<br/>

    obeying<br/>

    and serving this Dhamma?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>

    knowing the thought that was in my mind,<br/>

    just as a strong man might straighten out his bent arm<br/>

    or bend in his outstretched arm,<br/>

    just so did he vanish from the Brahma<br/>

    world and appear in front of me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>

    placing his outer robe over one shoulder<br/>

    and with his right knee pressing the ground,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    stretched out his joined palms towards me and said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, Wellfarer!</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever were in time past arahants,<br/>

    perfectly enlightened ones, lord,<br/>

    those reverend ones also dwelt honouring,<br/>

    reverencing,<br/>

    obeying<br/>

    and serving Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever, lord, in future time shall be arahants,<br/>

    perfectly enlightened ones, lord,<br/>

    those reverend ones shall also dwell honouring,<br/>

    reverencing,<br/>

    obeying<br/>

    and serving Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also now, lord,<br/>

    let the Exalted One who is arahant,<br/>

    a perfectly enlightened one,<br/>

    dwell honouring,<br/>

    reverencing,<br/>

    obeying<br/>

    and serving Dhamma."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake Brahmā Sahampati.</p>

    <p class="f4">So saying he added this further:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"The Perfect Buddhas who have passed,<br/>

    The Perfect Buddhas yet to come,<br/>

    The Perfect Buddha who is now,<br/>

    And hath for many banished woe, -<br/>

    All dwelt their dhamma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> honouring,<br/>

    Do dwell<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> and shall dwell: 'tis their way.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    So he to whom the self is dear,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span> Who longeth for the great Self<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> - he<br/>

    Should homage unto Dhamma pay,<br/>

    Remembering the Buddha-word."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake Brahmā Sahampati, monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">So saying he saluted me<br/>

    and keeping me on his right side<br/>

    vanished there and then.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, seeing that it was the wish of the Brahmā<br/>

    and proper for myself,<br/>

    I dwelt honouring,<br/>

    reverencing,<br/>

    obeying<br/>

    and serving that very Dhamma<br/>

    which had been well comprehended by me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks,<br/>

    since the Order has become possessed of greatness,<br/>

    I hold the Order also in strict regard.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>
