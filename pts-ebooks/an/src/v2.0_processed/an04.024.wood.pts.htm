    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Sākete, in Kāḷaka's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were to say:</p>

    that would be a fault in me.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, a Tathāgata is a seer of what is to be seen,<br/>

    but he has no conceit<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> of what is seen:<br/>

    he has no conceit of what has not been seen,<br/>

    he has no conceit of what is to be seen,<br/>

    he has no conceit about the seer.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing what is to be heard,<br/>

    he has no conceit of what has been heard<br/>

    he has no conceit of what has not been heard<br/>

    he has no conceit of what is to be heard,<br/>

    he has no conceit about the hearer.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also sensing what is to be sensed,<br/>

    he has no conceit of what has been sensed<br/>

    he has no conceit of what has not been sensed<br/>

    he has no conceit of what is to be sensed,<br/>

    he has no conceit about he who is the senser.</p>

    <p class="f4">Cognizing the cognizable<br/>

    he has no conceit of the thing cognized<br/>

    he has no conceit of what has not been cognized<br/>

    he has no conceit of what is to be cognized<br/>

    he has no conceit about he who has cognition.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, the Tathāgata,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    being such an one in things seen,<br/>

    heard,<br/>

    sensed,<br/>

    cognized,<br/>

    is "such."</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, than "he who is such "<br/>

    there is none other greater<br/>

    or more excellent,<br/>

    I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span> Whate'er is seen, heard, sensed or clung to is esteemed<br/>

    As truth by other folk. 'Midst those who are convinced<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    Not such am I, not one to claim that what they say,<br/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward follows the PTS Pali here and does not have this "don't". In the Pali this makes the first statement a lie. If the first statement had been "This the Tathāgata knows"; the second: "This the Tathāgata understands (Woodward's 'fully comprehend'), then the idea might have been the avoidance of the use of "I". But this is not the case in any version of the Pali, and it is a clearly understood principle that the "I" and so forth is permissible to use in conventional speech. Further, the four positions taken with regard to knowing are usually: "I know", "I do not know" "I both know and do not know" and "I neither know nor do not know." But there are only three positions given here. Surely this is the simple error of having neglected to insert the 'na', in the first of the three.</p>
