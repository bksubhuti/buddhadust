    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha on Vultures' Peak Hill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>

    a great number of notable Wanderers<br/>

    were in residence<br/>

    on the bank of the Snake river,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    in the Wanderers' Park,<br/>

    to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">the Wanderers Annabhara,<br/>

    Varadhara,<br/>

    Sakuludayin<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    and other notable Wanderers.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at eventide the Exalted One,<br/>

    arising from his solitary <span class="f2 g"><b>[33]</b></span> musing,<br/>

    went towards the bank of Snake river,<br/>

    where was the Wanderers' Park,<br/>

    and on reaching it<br/>

    sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat<br/>

    the Exalted One said this<br/>

    to those Wanderers:</p>

    <p class="f4">Wanderers, these four factors of Dhamma,<br/>

    reckoned as ancient,<br/>

    of long standing,<br/>

    as traditional,<br/>

    primeval,<br/>

    pure and unadulterated now as then,<br/>

    are not confounded<br/>

    nor shall they be,<br/>

    are not despised<br/>

    by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Not-coveting, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>

    reckoned as ancient,<br/>

    of long standing,<br/>

    as traditional,<br/>

    are not confounded<br/>

    nor shall they be,<br/>

    are not despised<br/>

    by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not-malice, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>

    nor shall they be,<br/>

    are not despised<br/>

    by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

    <p class="f4">Right mindfulness, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>

    reckoned as ancient,<br/>

    of long standing,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Right concentration, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br/>

    reckoned as ancient,<br/>

    of long standing,<br/>

    as traditional,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Now, Wanderers, if one should thus object:</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>Here and for the followings Bhk. Bodhi's understanding would make better sense: "If anyone should say: 'I will reject this Dhamma factor of ~ and point out a [real] ascetic of brahmin who has a mind of ~ (the negative factors)..." Woodward's translation has Gotama proposing an argument that is so simple-minded as to be disrespectful. Unlikely.</p>
