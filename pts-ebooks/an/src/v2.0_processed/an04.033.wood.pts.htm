    <h1>The Lion<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[33]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[36]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, the lion, king of beasts,<br/>

    at eventide comes forth from his lair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having come forth from his lair<br/>

    he stretches himself.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having stretched himself<br/>

    he surveys the four quarters in all directions.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having surveyed the four quarters in all directions<br/>

    he utters thrice his lion's roar.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thrice having uttered his lion's roar<br/>

    he sallies forth in search of prey.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, whatsoever brute creatures<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    hear the sound of the roaring of the lion,<br/>

    king of beasts,<br/>

    for the most part<br/>

    they are afraid:<br/>

    they fall to quaking and trembling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Those that dwell in holes seek them:<br/>

    water-dwellers make for the <span class="f2 g"><b>[37]</b></span> water:<br/>

    forest-dwellers enter the forest:<br/>

    birds mount into the air.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, whatsoever rajah's elephants<br/>

    in village,<br/>

    town,<br/>

    or rajah's residence<br/>

    are tethered with stout leathern bonds,<br/>

    such burst and rend those bonds asunder,<br/>

    void their excrements<br/>

    and in panic<br/>

    run to and fro.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus potent, monks, is the lion,<br/>

    king of beasts,<br/>

    over brute creatures:<br/>

    of such mighty power and majesty is he.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, monks, when a Tathāgata arises in the world,<br/>

    an Arahant,<br/>

    a Perfectly Enlightened One,<br/>

    perfect in lore and conduct,<br/>

    Wellfarer,<br/>

    a world-knower,<br/>

    the trainer unsurpassed<br/>

    of men who can be trained,<br/>

    teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>

    a Buddha,<br/>

    an Exalted One, -<br/>

    he teaches Dhamma:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Such is the person-pack:<br/>

    such the origin of the person-pack:<br/>

    such is the ending of the person-pack:<br/>

    such is the practice going to end the person-pack."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, whatsoever devas there be,<br/>

    long-lived,<br/>

    lovely,<br/>

    and become happy,<br/>

    for a long time established in lofty palaces,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> -<br/>

    they too,<br/>

    on hearing the Dhamma-teaching of the Tathāgata,<br/>

    for the most part<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> are afraid:<br/>

    they fall to quaking and trembling,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It seems, sirs,<br/>

    that we who thought ourselves permanent<br/>

    are after all impermanent:<br/>

    that we who thought ourselves stable<br/>

    are after all unstable:<br/>

    not to last, sirs, it seems are we:<br/>

    and lasting we thought ourselves.</p>

    <p class="f4">So it seems, sirs,<br/>

    that we are impermanent,<br/>

    unstable,<br/>

    not to last,<br/>

    compassed about with a person-pack.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus potent, monks, is a Tathāgata<br/>

    over the world of devas and mankind:<br/>

    of such mighty power and majesty is he.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span> When a Buddha, fully knowing,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    Sets the Dhamma-wheel a-rolling-<br/>

    Teacher he without a rival<br/>

    Of the devas and the world-<br/>

    Teaching that the framework<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> ceases<br/>

    And the framework comes to be,<br/>

    And the Ariyan Eightfold Way<br/>

    That leads to calming of all Ill, -<br/>

    Devas, they who live for ages,<br/>

    Beauteous, of great renown,<br/>

    Like the beasts before the lion,<br/>

    Fall a-trembling, are afraid;<br/>

    For they have not done with framework.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    "Transient, friends," say they, "are we,"<br/>

    Whenas they hear the Arahant's words,<br/>

    Of such an one who well is freed.'</p>

    <p>"... having destroyed the āsavas"? Those would be Arahants and not devas. Even followers up to a certain point would tremble if they understood that the individuality was temporary. Most human beings know that they are going to die, but it only reaches home when the Doctor tells them it's about to happen.</p>
