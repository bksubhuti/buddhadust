    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four best faiths.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Pasādā.</i> This sutta occurs at <i>Itiv.</i> 87 (and is included at <i>A.</i> iii, 36) in three sections; but to make it a Four the Eightfold Way is here inserted, but this is not in the gāthas, which are the same in all three books. The gāthas deal with the 'triple gem' and charity (four bests). It is also curious that <i>Comy.</i> does not mention the gāthas either here or at <i>A.</i> iii. Have they been added from Itivuttaka (which for several reasons I conclude to be an older collection than <i>Aṇguttara</i>)? Or does this show that the prose part is later than, or written up to, the gāthas (a thing which evidently has been done in some cases, not to mention the Jātaka <i>Comy.</i>)? <i>Comy.</i> on <i>Ratana-sutta</i> of <i>Khuddaka-P.</i> <i>(KhpA)</i> quotes our sutta several times.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Quoted <i>Vis. Mag.</i> i, 293, where yāvatā (an adverb) is incorrectly taken as a pronoun, as also in our <i>Comy.</i> Text omits 'that is' <i>(yad idaṃ),</i> which is in the <i>Itiv.</i> text.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Mada-nimmadana = māna-mada-purisa-mada,</i> acc. to <i>VM.</i> <i>loc. cit.;</i> but our <i>Comy.</i> <i>rāga-mada.</i> We cannot help noting that all these negative virtues are regarded as the best things.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Virāge (dhamme),</i> not in text, but at <i>A.</i> iii, 36 and <i>Itiv.</i> 87" <i>Cf.</i> Vimāna V. 51, <i>rāga-virāgam anejam asohaṃ dhammaṃ.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Purisa-pugglā.</i> <i>Comy.</i> does not notice this either here or at <i>A.</i> iii, 36. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Dial.</i> iii, 238: those on the four paths, together with those who have won the fruits thereof.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> v, 296 ff., where the Buddha remarks that the winning of four continents is not worth one-quarter of a quarter of these four.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Aggassa dātā is taken by <i>Comy.</i> on <i>Sn.</i> 217 (<i>SnA.</i> ii, 270) as 'off the top,' 'first-fruits.' <i>Cf.</i> A. iii, 42, 61 <i>(agga-dāyī)</i>.</p>
