    <p><span class="f2">[37]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was journeying along the highroad between Ukkaṭṭhā and Setabbya.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now the brahmin Doṇa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> was also journeying along the highroad between Ukkaṭṭhā and Setabbya.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahmin Doṇa, beheld on the footprints of the Exalted One the wheel-marks<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> with their thousand spokes, with their rims and hubs and all their attributes complete.</p>

    <p class="f4">On seeing these he thought thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">It is wonderful indeed! It is marvellous indeed! These will not be the footprints of one in human form.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just then the Exalted One stepped aside from the highroad and sat down at the root of a certain tree, sitting cross-legged, holding his body upright and setting up mindfulness in front of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahmin Doṇa, following up the Exalted One's footprints, beheld the Exalted One seated at the foot of a certain tree.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seeing him comely, faith-inspiring,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> with senses calmed, tranquil of mind, in the attainment of composure by masterly control, (like) a tamed, alert, perfectly trained<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> elephant,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> he approached the Exalted One and drawing near to him said this:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span> 'Your worship will become<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> a deva?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No indeed, brahmin. I'll not become a deva."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then your worship will become a gandharva?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No indeed, brahmin, I'll not become a gandharva."</p>

    <p class="f4">"A yakkha, then?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No indeed, brahmin, not a yakkha."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then your worship will become a human being?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No indeed, brahmin, I'll not become a human being."</p>

    <p class="f4">"When questioned thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Your worship will become a deva?</p>

    <p class="f4">You reply:</p>

    <p class="f4">'No indeed, brahmin. I'll not become a deva.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Who then, pray, will your worship become?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brahmin, those āsavas whereby,<br/>

    if they were not abandoned,<br/>

    I should become a deva, -<br/>

    those āsavas in me are abandoned,<br/>

    cut off at the root,<br/>

    <p>Bhk. Thanissaro's solution here is that this is a manner of speech. I would only express it slightly differently as a contracted form of: "Will you be being about being a ..." From the perspective of the awakened mind there is actually no true 'present' to base a present tense upon in the case of asking a person what he is in the present. Things are under constant change, so a being is always about becoming something. There should really be a special tense for this case: The present-future or the future-present.</p>
