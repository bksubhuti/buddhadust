    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[51]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four ways of making-concentration-to-become.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, monks, the making-concentration-to-become which,<br/>

    when developed and made much of,<br/>

    conduces to happy <span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span> living in this very life.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, monks, the making-concentration-to-become which,<br/>

    when developed and made much of,<br/>

    conduces to winning knowledge-and-insight.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">There is, monks, the making-concentration-to-become which,<br/>

    when developed and made much of,<br/>

    conduces to mindfulness and well-awareness.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, monks, that which,<br/>

    when developed and made much of,<br/>

    conduces to the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[2][than][olds]</span> Now, monks, what sort of making-concentration-to-become which,<br/>

    when developed and made much of,<br/>

    conduces to happy living in this very life?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk, aloof from sense-desires ...<br/>

    <i>[aloof from unprofitable states of mind,]</i> or<br/>

    <i>[aloof from evil conditions]</i><br/>

    attains the first musing<br/>

    <i>[which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    born of seclusion,<br/>

    zestful and easeful,<br/>

    and abides therein]</i>;</p>

    <p class="f4">by the calming down of thought directed and sustained ...<br/>

    <i>[he enters on that inward calm,<br/>

    that single-minded purpose,<br/>

    apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    born of mental balance,<br/>

    zestful and easeful,]</i><br/>

    he attains the second musing;</p>

    <p class="f4">by the fading out of zest ...<br/>

    <i>[he becomes balanced and<br/>

    remains mindful and composed,<br/>

    and experiences with the body<br/>

    that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:<br/>

    "The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily," and]</i><br/>

    he attains the third musing;</p>

    <p class="f4">by rejecting pleasure and pain alike ...<br/>

    <i>[by the coming to an end<br/>

    of the joy and sorrow which he had before,]</i><br/>

    he attains the fourth musing<br/>

    <i>[free of pain and free of pleasure,<br/>

    a state of perfect purity<br/>

    of balance and equanimity.]</i> <span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/>

    "the making-concentration-to-become<br/>

    which conduces to happy living<br/>

    in this very life."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[3][than][olds]</span> And of what sort is that<br/>

    which conduces to winning knowledge-and-insight?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk pays attention to consciousness of light,<br/>

    he concentrates on consciousness of daylight,<span class="f4"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    as by day, so by night,<br/>

    as by night, so by day.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus with wits alert,<br/>

    with wits unhampered,<br/>

    he cultivates the mind to brilliance.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the making-concentration-to-become which,<br/>

    when developed and made much of,<br/>

    conduces to winning knowledge-and-insight."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[4][than][olds]</span> And of what sort of making-concentration-to-become which,<br/>

    when developed and made much of,<br/>

    conduces to mindfulness and well-awareness?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the feelings which arise in a monk<br/>

    are evident<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[53]</b></span> to him,<br/>

    the feelings which abide with him<br/>

    are evident to him,<br/>

    the feelings which come to an end in him<br/>

    are evident to him.</p>

    <p class="f4">The perceptions which arise in him<br/>

    are evident to him,<br/>

    the perceptions which abide with him<br/>

    are evident to him,<br/>

    the perceptions which come to an end in him<br/>

    are evident to him.</p>

    <p class="f4">The trains of thought which arise in him,<br/>

    which abide with him,<br/>

    which come to an end in him<br/>

    are evident to him.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the making-concentration-to-become<br/>

    which conduces to mindfulness and well-awareness."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[5][than][olds]</span> And of what sort of making-concentration-to-become<br/>

    if developed and made much of,<br/>

    conduces to the destruction of the āsavas?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells<br/>

    observing the rise and fall<br/>

    in the five factors of grasping,<br/>

    thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is material,<br/>

    such is the arising of material,<br/>

    such its vanishing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is feeling,<br/>

    such is the arising of feeling,<br/>

    such its vanishing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is perception,<br/>

    such is the arising of perception,<br/>

    such its vanishing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such are the activities,<br/>

    such the arising of the activities,<br/>

    such their vanishing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is consciousness,<br/>

    such the arising of consciousness,<br/>

    such the vanishing of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the making-concentration-to-become<br/>

    which conduces to the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four forms of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, in this connexion<br/>

    I thus spoke in <i>The Chapter on the Goal</i><br/>

    in (the sutta called) <i>The Questions of <i>Puṇṇaka:</i></i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>
