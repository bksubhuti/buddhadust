    <p><span class="f2">[56]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[65]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four floods of merit,<br/>

    floods of things profitable,<br/>

    bringing happiness,<br/>

    giving the best things,<br/>

    whose fruit is happiness,<br/>

    leading to the heaven world,<br/>

    leading to what is dear,<br/>

    delightful<br/>

    and pleasant,<br/>

    to profit<br/>

    and happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br/>

    of unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br/>

    Arahant,<br/>

    a fully Enlightened One,<br/>

    perfect in lore and conduct,<br/>

    Wellfarer,<br/>

    a world-knower,<br/>

    the trainer unsurpassed<br/>

    of men who can be trained,<br/>

    teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>

    a Buddha,<br/>

    an Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the first flood of merit,<br/>

    flood of things profitable,<br/>

    bringing happiness,<br/>

    giving the best things,<br/>

    whose fruit is happiness,<br/>

    leading to the heaven world,<br/>

    leading to what is dear,<br/>

    delightful<br/>

    and pleasant,<br/>

    to profit<br/>

    and happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br/>

    of unwavering loyalty to Dhamma, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is Dhamma,<br/>

    to be seen in this life,<br/>

    not a thing of time,<br/>

    (inviting to) come and see,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    leading onward,<br/>

    to be understood by the wise,<br/>

    each for himself.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the second flood of merit,<br/>

    flood of things profitable,<br/>

    bringing happiness,<br/>

    giving the best things,<br/>

    whose fruit is happiness,<br/>

    leading to the heaven world,<br/>

    leading to what is dear,<br/>

    delightful<br/>

    and pleasant,<br/>

    to profit<br/>

    and happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br/>

    of unwavering loyalty to the Order of monks, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking the Way well<br/>

    is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>

    walking uprightly,<br/>

    walking according to the Method,<br/>

    walking dutifully<br/>

    is the Exalted One's Order of disciples:<br/>

    namely, the four pairs of men,<br/>

    the eight types<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>

    worthy of reverence,<br/>

    worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>

    a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the third flood of merit,<br/>

    flood of things profitable,<br/>

    bringing happiness,<br/>

    giving the best things,<br/>

    whose fruit is happiness,<br/>

    leading to the heaven world,<br/>

    leading to what is dear,<br/>

    delightful<br/>

    and pleasant,<br/>

    to profit<br/>

    and happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br/>

    of the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/>

    virtues unbroken,<br/>

    whole,<br/>

    unspotted,<br/>

    untarnished,<br/>

    giving freedom,<br/>

    praised by the wise;<br/>

    virtues untainted,<br/>

    which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the fourth flood of merit,<br/>

    flood of things profitable,<br/>

    bringing happiness,<br/>

    giving the best things,<br/>

    whose fruit is happiness,<br/>

    leading to the heaven world,<br/>

    leading to what is dear,<br/>

    delightful<br/>

    and pleasant,<br/>

    to profit<br/>

    and happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, these are the four floods of merit, floods of <span class="f2 g"><b>[66]</b></span> things profitable,<br/>

    bringing happiness,<br/>

    giving the best things,<br/>

    whose fruit is happiness,<br/>

    leading to the heaven world,<br/>

    leading to what is dear,<br/>

    delightful<br/>

    and pleasant,<br/>

    to profit<br/>

    and happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Whoso hath faith in the Tathāgata<br/>

    Unwavering and firm, whose life is good,<br/>

    Praised by the Ariyans and dear to them;<br/>

    Whoso is likewise loyal to the Order<br/>

    And looks straight forth, - "He is not poor"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> they say,<br/>

    "Not (lived) in vain the life of such a man."<br/>

    So let the wise man cultivate (these four)<br/>

    Faith, virtue, piety and seeing Dhamma,<br/>

    Bearing the Buddha's message in his mind.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
