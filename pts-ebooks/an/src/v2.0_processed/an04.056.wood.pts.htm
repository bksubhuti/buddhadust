    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Herein, monks,<br/>

    if both wife and husband<br/>

    desire to behold each other<br/>

    both in this very life<br/>

    and in the life to come,<br/>

    and both are matched in faith,<br/>

    matched in virtue,<br/>

    matched in generosity,<br/>

    matched in wisdom,<br/>

    then do they behold each other<br/>

    in this very life<br/>

    and in the life to come.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr"> If both, believers, self-controlled, well-spoken,<br/>

    Living as dhamma bids, use loving words<br/>

    One to the other, manifold the blessings<br/>

    That come to wife and husband, and to them<br/>

    The blessing of a pleasant life is born.<br/>

    Dejected are their foes, for both are good.<br/>

    So in this world, living as dhamma bids,<br/>

    The pair, in goodness matched, i' the deva-world<br/>

    Rejoicing win the bliss that they desire.'</p>
