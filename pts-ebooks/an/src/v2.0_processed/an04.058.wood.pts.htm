    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat the Exalted One said this to the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Housefather, the Ariyan disciple who gives food gives four things to the receiver thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">He gives life, beauty, happiness and strength.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, giving life<br/>

    he is a partaker of life,<br/>

    be it as deva or human:<br/>

    giving beauty<br/>

    he is a partaker of beauty,<br/>

    be it as deva or human:<br/>

    giving happiness,<br/>

    he is a partaker of happiness,<br/>

    be it as deva or human:<br/>

    giving strength<br/>

    he is a partaker of strength,<br/>

    be it as deva or human.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yes, housefather,<br/>

    the Ariyan disciple<br/>

    who gives food<br/>

    gives these four things<br/>

    to the receiver thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">To those well trained, who live on others' alms,<br/>

    Whoso gives zealously in season due<br/>

    Their daily food, on them confers four things:<br/>

    Long life and beauty, happiness and strength.<br/>

    Who giveth life, strength, beauty, happiness,<br/>

    Hath long and honoured life, wherever born.'</p>
