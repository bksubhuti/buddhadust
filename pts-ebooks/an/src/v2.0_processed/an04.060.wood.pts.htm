    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>

    the Exalted One said this to the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Housefather, possessed of four things<br/>

    the Ariyan disciple has entered on<br/>

    the householder's path of duty,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    a path which brings good repute<br/>

    and leads to the heaven world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, housefather, the Ariyan disciple waits upon the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">He waits upon the Order of monks<br/>

    with the offer of a robe,<br/>

    he waits upon the Order of monks<br/>

    with the offer of alms-food<br/>

    he waits upon the Order of monks<br/>

    with the offer of lodging<br/>

    he waits upon the Order of monks<br/>

    with the offer of requisites and medicines for use in sickness.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four things.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">They are wise folk who enter on the path<br/>

    Of duty which becomes the householder,<br/>

    Serving the virtuous ones who on the Way<br/>

    Have rightly trod<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> with offerings of robes,<br/>

    Of alms-food, lodging, comforts, requisites.<br/>

    By day and night their merit groweth ever;<br/>

    Doing the lucky deed one reaches<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> heaven.'</p>
