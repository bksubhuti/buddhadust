    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, those families where mother and father<br/>

    are worshipped in the home<br/>

    are reckoned like unto Brahma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Those families where mother and father<br/>

    are worshipped in the home<br/>

    are ranked with teachers of old.</p>

    <p class="f4">Those families where mother and father are worshipped in the home<br/>

    are ranked with the devas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of old.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of offerings, monks, are those families<br/>

    where mother and father are worshipped in the home.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brahma," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Teachers of old," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Devas of old," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Worthy of offerings," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because mother and father do much for children,<br/>

    they bring them up,<br/>

    nourish<br/>

    and introduce them to the world.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Parents are "Brahma" called, "teachers of old,"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    Worthy of gifts are they, compassionate<br/>

    Unto their tribe of children. Thus the wise<br/>

    Should worship them and pay them honours due.<br/>

    Serve them with food and drink, clothing and bed.<br/>

    Anoint their bodies, bathe and wash their feet.<br/>

    For service such as this to parents given<br/>

    In this life sages praise a man, and he<br/>

    Hereafter has reward of joy in heaven.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
