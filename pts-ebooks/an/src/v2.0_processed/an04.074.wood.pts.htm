    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just as, monks,<br/>

    when a young wife<br/>

    is first led home (to her husband)<br/>

    either by day or night,<br/>

    she at first feels exceeding great fear and bashfulness<br/>

    in the presence of her mother-in-law,<br/>

    her father-in-law,<br/>

    her husband,<br/>

    and even towards servants and work-people;<br/>

    but as time goes on,<br/>

    owing to living together and intimacy,<br/>

    she addresses mother-in-law,<br/>

    father-in-law<br/>

    and husband thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Away with you! What do you know?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Just in like manner, monks,<br/>

    a certain monk here maybe,<br/>

    when he first goes forth,<br/>

    whether by day or night,<br/>

    from the home to the homeless life,<br/>

    feels exceeding great fear and bashfulness<br/>

    in the presence of monks and nuns,<br/>

    disciples male <span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span> and female<br/>

    even of novices who serve in the monastery,<br/>

    but as time goes on,<br/>

    owing to living together and intimacy,<br/>

    he addresses teacher<br/>

    and preceptor thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Away with you! What do you know?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

    <p class="f4">I will dwell in mind<br/>

    like a young wife newly arrived.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how ye must train yourselves.'</p>
