    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four purities in gifts.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is a gift, monks,<br/>

    which is made pure on the part of the giver,<br/>

    not of the receiver.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is a gift, monks,<br/>

    which is made pure on the part of the receiver,<br/>

    not of the giver.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is a gift, monks,<br/>

    which is made pure on neither side,</p>

    <p class="f4">There is a gift, monks,<br/>

    which is made pure on both sides.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, how is a gift<br/>

    made pure on the part of the giver,<br/>

    not of the receiver?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case the giver is virtuous,<br/>

    of a lovely nature;<br/>

    the receivers are immoral<br/>

    and of a wicked nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus the gift is made pure<br/>

    on the part of the giver,<br/>

    not of the receiver.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And how is a gift<br/>

    made pure on the part of the receiver,<br/>

    not of the giver?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br/>

    the giver is immoral,<br/>

    of a wicked nature,<br/>

    while the receivers are virtuous,<br/>

    of a lovely nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus the gift<br/>

    made pure on the part of the receiver,<br/>

    not of the giver.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is a gift<br/>

    made pure neither on the part of the giver<br/>

    nor of the receiver?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br/>

    both giver and receiver are immoral,<br/>

    of a wicked nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus the gift<br/>

    made pure neither on the part of the giver<br/>

    nor of the receiver.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span> And how is a gift made pure<br/>

    both on the part of the giver<br/>

    and of the receiver?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br/>

    the giver is virtuous,<br/>

    of a lovely nature,<br/>

    and the receiver virtuous,<br/>

    of a lovely nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus the gift is made pure on both sides.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four purities in gifts.'</p>
