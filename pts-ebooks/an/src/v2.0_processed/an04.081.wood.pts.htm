    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>

    one is put into purgatory<br/>

    according to his deserts.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">He takes life,<br/>

    steals,<br/>

    is a wrong-doer in things sensual,<br/>

    a liar.</p>

    <p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br/>

    one is put into purgatory<br/>

    according to his deserts.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>

    one is put into heaven<br/>

    <p class="f4">He abstains from taking life,<br/>

    from stealing,<br/>

    from wrongdoing in things sensual,<br/>

    and from lying.</p>
