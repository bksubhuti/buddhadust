    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>

    one is put into purgatory<br/>

    according to his deserts.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">He is a liar,<br/>

    he is a malicious speaker,<br/>

    he is of harsh speech,<br/>

    he is an idle babbler.</p>

    <p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br/>

    one is put into purgatory<br/>

    according to his deserts.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>

    one is put into heaven<br/>

    according to his deserts.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">He abstains from telling lies,<br/>

    he abstains from malicious speech,<br/>

    he abstains from harsh speech,<br/>

    he abstains from idle babble.</p>

    <p class="f4">Possessed of four qualities<br/>

    one is put into heaven<br/>

    according to his deserts."</p>
