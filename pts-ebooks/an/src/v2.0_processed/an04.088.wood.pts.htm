    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The unshaken recluse,<br/>

    the blue-lotus recluse,<br/>

    the white-lotus recluse,<br/>

    and the recluse who is exquisite among recluses.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person an unshaken recluse?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk, by the wearing out of three fetters is a stream-winner,<br/>

    of a nature not to go to the downfall,<br/>

    one assured,<br/>

    bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, is a person an unshaken recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a blue-lotus recluse?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[99]</b></span> Herein a monk, by utterly wearing out three fetters<br/>

    and by weakening lust, anger and delusion,<br/>

    is a once-returner.</p>

    <p class="f4">Coming back just once more to this world<br/>

    he makes an end of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, is a person a blue-lotus recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a white-lotus recluse?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk, by utterly wearing out the five fetters<br/>

    which cause rebirth here,<br/>

    is apparitionally born,<br/>

    destined there to pass utterly away,<br/>

    of a nature not to return from that world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, is a person a white-lotus recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a recluse exquisite among recluses?</p>

    <p class="f4">	Herein a monk by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/>

    has reached the heart's release,<br/>

    the release by wisdom<br/>

    that is free from the āsavas,<br/>

    and having realized it<br/>

    abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is a person a recluse exquisite among recluses.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>
