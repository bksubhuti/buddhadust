    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[100]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The unshaken recluse,<br/>

    the blue-lotus recluse,<br/>

    the white-lotus recluse,<br/>

    and the recluse who is exquisite among recluses.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person an unshaken recluse?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, one is a pupil,<br/>

    who has not made up his mind,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    but lives aspiring<br/>

    for the unsurpassed rest from the toil.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus a person is an unshaken recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a blue-lotus recluse?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in the contemplation of the rise and fall of the five-grasping-groups, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is form,<br/>

    such is the arising of form,<br/>

    such is the passing away of form.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is feeling<br/>

    such is the arising of feeling,<br/>

    such is the passing away of feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">such is perception<br/>

    such is the arising of perception,<br/>

    such is the passing away of perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">such are the activities<br/>

    such is the arising of the activities,<br/>

    such is the passing away of the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">such is consciousness<br/>

    such is the arising of consciousness,<br/>

    such is the passing away of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">But he does not abide<br/>

    experiencing with his own person<br/>

    the eight deliverances.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus a person is a blue-lotus recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a white-lotus recluse?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in the contemplation of the rise and fall of the five-grasping-groups, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is form,<br/>

    such is the arising of form,<br/>

    such is the passing away of form.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is feeling<br/>

    such is the arising of feeling,<br/>

    such is the passing away of feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">such is perception<br/>

    such is the arising of perception,<br/>

    such is the passing away of perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">such are the activities<br/>

    such is the arising of the activities,<br/>

    such is the passing away of the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">such is consciousness<br/>

    such is the arising of consciousness,<br/>

    such is the passing away of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">But he does abide<br/>

    experiencing with his own person<br/>

    the eight deliverances.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus a person is a white-lotus recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a recluse exquisite among recluses?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk when invited<br/>

    enjoys a plentiful supply of robes,<br/>

    but he gets little if uninvited;<br/>

    when invited<br/>

    enjoys a plentiful supply of alms-food and lodging;<br/>

    but he gets little if uninvited;<br/>

    when invited<br/>

    he enjoys a plentiful supply of requisites<br/>

    and medicines for use in sickness,<br/>

    but he gets little if uninvited.</p>

    <p class="f4">With whatsoever fellows in the holy life he dwells,<br/>

    their behaviour (towards him)<br/>

    in action of body, speech and thought<br/>

    is generally pleasing,<br/>

    rarely displeasing;<br/>

    moreover their presents to him<br/>

    are generally pleasing,<br/>

    rarely displeasing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, as to those afflictions<br/>

    which originate from bile,<br/>

    phlegm,<br/>

    wind,<br/>

    from the union of bodily humours,<br/>

    from changes of seasons,<br/>

    from stress of circumstances,<br/>

    from personal assaults,<br/>

    or from the ripeness of one's karma, -<br/>

    such do not trouble him much.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is free from sickness.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to the four musings<br/>

    which belong to the higher thought<br/>

    and lead to happy living<br/>

    in this very life,<br/>

    he is a winner of them at will,<br/>

    without difficulty<br/>

    and without trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4">By destroying the āsavas<br/>

    he reaches the heart's release,<br/>

    the release by wisdom,<br/>

    himself comprehending it<br/>

    in this very life,<br/>

    and having attained it<br/>

    he abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, is a person<br/>

    a recluse exquisite among recluses.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now monks, if rightly speaking<br/>

    one would speak about the recluse exquisite among recluses,<br/>

    it is just of me that he would rightly use the words.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>
