    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The asura with a retinue of asuras,<br/>

    the asura with a retinue of devas,<br/>

    the deva with a retinue of asuras,<br/>

    and the deva with a retinue of devas.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person an asura<br/>

    with a retinue of asuras?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain person is immoral,<br/>

    of a wicked nature,<br/>

    and his company is immoral,<br/>

    of a wicked nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus a person is an asura<br/>

    with a retinue of asuras</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person an asura<br/>

    with a retinue of devas?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks, a person is immoral,<br/>

    of a wicked nature,<br/>

    but his company is virtuous,<br/>

    of a lovely nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus a person is an asura<br/>

    with a retinue of devas</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a deva<br/>

    with a retinue of asuras?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks, a person is virtuous,<br/>

    of a lovely nature,<br/>

    but his company is immoral,<br/>

    of a wicked nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus a person is a person a deva<br/>

    with a retinue of asuras</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a deva<br/>

    with a retinue of devas?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks, a person is virtuous,<br/>

    of a lovely nature,<br/>

    and his company is virtuous,<br/>

    of a lovely nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus a person is a deva<br/>

    with a retinue of devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">So these are the four persons found existing in the world.*</p>
