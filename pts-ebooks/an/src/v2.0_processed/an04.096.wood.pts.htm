    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">He who is bent, on his own profit,<br/>

    not another's;<br/>

    he who is bent on another's profit,<br/>

    not his own;<br/>

    he who is bent on the profit of neither;<br/>

    he who is bent on the profit of both.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent on his own profit,<br/>

    not another's?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is bent on the restraint of lust in self,<br/>

    but does not incite another to the restraint of lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is bent on the restraint of hatred in self,<br/>

    but does net incite another to the restraint of hatred.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is bent on the restraint of delusion in self,<br/>

    but does not incite another to the restraint of delusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is bent on his own profit, not on another's.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent on another's profit,<br/>

    not on his own?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person who is not bent on the restraint of lust in self,<br/>

    incites another to the restraint of lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person who is not bent on the restraint of hatred in self,<br/>

    incites another to the restraint of hatred.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person who is not bent on the restraint of delusion in self,<br/>

    incites another to the restraint of delusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is bent on another's profit,<br/>

    not on his own.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent neither on his own nor on another's profit?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is not bent on the restraint of lust in self,<br/>

    nor does he incite another to the restraint of lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is not bent on the restraint of hatred in self,<br/>

    nor does he incite another to the restraint of hatred.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is not bent on the restraint of delusion in self,<br/>

    nor does he incite another to the restraint of delusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is bent neither on his own nor on another's profit.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent on the profit both of self and another?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a person is both bent on the restraint of lust in self,<br/>

    and incites another to the restraint of lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a person is both bent on the restraint of hatred in self,<br/>

    and incites another to the restraint of hatred.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a person is both bent on the restraint of delusion in self in self,<br/>

    and incites another to the restraint of delusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is bent on the profit both of self and another</p>

    <p class="f4">So these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>
