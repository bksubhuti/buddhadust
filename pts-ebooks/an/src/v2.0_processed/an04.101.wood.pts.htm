    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[109]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four rain-clouds.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The thunderer not the rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The rainer not the thunderer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The neither thunderer nor rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The both thunderer and rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[110]</b></span> In like manner, monks, these four persons resembling rain-clouds<br/>

    are to be found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The thunderer not the rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The rainer not the thunderer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The neither thunderer nor rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The both thunderer and rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, how is a person<br/>

    a thunderer but no rainer?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks, a person<br/>

    speaks but acts not.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is one who thunders but rains not.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as that cloud thunders but rains not,<br/>

    so using this figure<br/>

    do I speak of this person.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>

    a rainer but no thunderer?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks, a person is one who acts but speaks not.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is one who rains but thunders not.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as that cloud rains but thunders not,<br/>

    so using this figure<br/>

    do I speak of this person.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>

    one who is neither thunderer nor rainer?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a person neither speaks nor acts.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is one who neither thunders nor rains.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as that cloud neither thunders nor rains,<br/>

    so using this figure<br/>

    do I speak of this person.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>

    both thunderer and rainer?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a person both speaks and acts.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is one who thunders and rains.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as that cloud both thunders and rains,<br/>

    so using this figure<br/>

    do I speak of this person.</p>

    <p class="f4">So these are the four persons found existing in the world.</p>
