    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four rain-clouds.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The thunderer not the rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The rainer not the thunderer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The neither thunderer nor rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The both thunderer and rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

    <p class="f4">In like manner, monks, these four persons resembling rain-clouds<br/>

    are to be found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The thunderer not the rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The rainer not the thunderer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The neither thunderer nor rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The both thunderer and rainer.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, how is a person<br/>

    a thunderer but no rainer?</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a thunderer but not a rainer?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain person masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhamma and Vedalla.</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Yet he understands not,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ending of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice going to the ending of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is one<br/>

    who thunders but rains not.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as that rain-cloud thunders but rains not,<br/>

    even so using this figure<br/>

    do I speak of this person.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>

    one who rains but thunders not?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span> In this case a certain person does not master Dhamma,<br/>

    to wit:</p>

    so using this figure<br/>

    do I speak of this person.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person both thunderer and rainer?

    In this case a certain person both masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhamma and Vedalla.</i></p>
