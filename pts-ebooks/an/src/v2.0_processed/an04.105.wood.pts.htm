    <h1>Pools of Water (b)</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four pools of water.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The shallow which looks deep,<br/>

    the deep which looks shallow,<br/>

    the shallow which looks shallow,<br/>

    and the deep which looks deep.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four pools of water.</p>

    <p class="f4">In like manner, monks, there are these four persons resembling pools of water to be found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The shallow which looks deep,<br/>

    the deep which looks shallow,<br/>

    the shallow which looks shallow,<br/>

    and the deep which looks deep.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, how is a person shallow but look deep?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case the mien of a certain person<br/>

    is charming,<br/>

    whether he be departing or approaching,<br/>

    looking forward or backward,<br/>

    bending or unbending (his arm),<br/>

    or bearing outer robe,<br/>

    bowl<br/>

    and (ordinary) robe.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet he understands not,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ending of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice going to the ending of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person<br/>

    is shallow but looks deep.</p>

    <p class="f4">As is that pool of water is shallow but looks deep,<br/>

    even so using this figure<br/>

    do I speak of this person.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br/>

    deep but look shallow?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case the mien of a certain person is not charming,<br/>

    whether he be departing or approaching,<br/>

    looking forward or backward,<br/>

    bowl<br/>

    and (ordinary) robe.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet he does understand,<br/>
