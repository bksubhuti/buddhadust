    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[113]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four oxen.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The one that is fierce to the cows of its own herd,<br/>

    but not to the cows of another herd,<br/>

    the one that is fierce to the cows of another herd,<br/>

    but not to those of its own herd,<br/>

    the one that is fierce to both the cows of its own heard,<br/>

    and the cows of another heard,<br/>

    and the one that is fierce to neither the cows of its own heard,<br/>

    nor the cows of another heard.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[114]</b></span> In like manner, monks, these four persons resembling oxen<br/>

    are to be found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The one that is fierce to the cows of its own herd,<br/>

    but not to the cows of another herd,<br/>

    the one that is fierce to the cows of another herd,<br/>

    but not to those of its own herd,<br/>

    the one that is fierce to both the cows of its own heard,<br/>

    and the cows of another heard,<br/>

    and the one that is fierce to neither the cows of its own heard,<br/>

    nor the cows of another heard.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person (like) an ox<br/>

    fierce to the cows of its own herd,<br/>

    but not to the cows of another herd?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person is a terror to his own company,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    but not to another's company.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus a person is (like) an ox<br/>

    fierce to the cows of its own herd,<br/>

    but not to the cows of another herd</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, monks, an ox is fierce to the cows of its own herd,<br/>

    but not to the cows of another herd,<br/>

    so using this figure do I speak of this person.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
