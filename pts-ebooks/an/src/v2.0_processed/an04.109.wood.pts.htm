    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four trees.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Sapwood surrounded by sapwood,<br/>

    sapwood surrounded by heartwood,<br/>

    heartwood surrounded by sapwood,<br/>

    and heart-wood surrounded by heartwood.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

    <p class="f4">In like manner, monks, these four persons resembling trees<br/>

    are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Sapwood surrounded by sapwood,<br/>

    sapwood surrounded by heartwood,<br/>

    heartwood surrounded by sapwood,<br/>

    and heart-wood surrounded by heartwood.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[115]</b></span> And how, monks, is a person like sapwood<br/>

    surrounded by sapwood?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person is immoral,<br/>

    of a wicked nature,<br/>

    and his company is immoral,<br/>

    of a wicked nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus a person is like sapwood<br/>

    surrounded by sapwood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as that tree of sapwood is surrounded by sapwood trees,<br/>

    even so using this figure do I speak of this person.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person like sapwood<br/>

    surrounded by heartwood?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person is immoral,<br/>

    of a wicked nature,<br/>

    but his company is virtuous,<br/>

    of a lovely nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus a person is like sapwood<br/>

    surrounded by heartwood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as that tree of sapwood is surrounded by heartwood trees,<br/>

    even so using this figure do I speak of this person.</p>
