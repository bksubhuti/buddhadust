    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four occasions.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, monks, the occasion when action is unpleasant<br/>

    and unprofitable to the doer;<br/>

    that occasion when action is unpleasant<br/>

    but profitable to the doer;<br/>

    that occasion when action is pleasant<br/>

    but unprofitable to the doer;<br/>

    and the occasion when action is both pleasant<br/>

    and profitable to the doer.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, in the first instance,<br/>

    in a case when action is both unpleasant<br/>

    and unprofitable to the doer,<br/>

    one deems action inadvisable for both reasons,<br/>

    for it is both unpleasant and unprofitable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, in the second instance, that is,<br/>

    when action is unpleasant<br/>

    but profitable,<br/>

    one may know who is a fool<br/>

    and <span class="f2 g"><b>[123]</b></span> who a wise man<br/>

    in the matter of manly strength,<br/>

    manly vigour<br/>

    and energy.</p>

    <p class="f4">For, monks, the fool has no such consideration as this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Though this is an occasion when action is unpleasant,<br/>

    yet it is one which brings profit.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Accordingly he does not act,<br/>

    and his inaction brings him loss.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the wise man thus considers:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Though this is an occasion when action is unpleasant,<br/>

    yet it brings profit to the doer.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Accordingly he acts,<br/>

    and profit results.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now in the third case<br/>

    when action is pleasant<br/>

    but unprofitable, -<br/>

    in this case also one may know who is a fool<br/>

    and who a wise man<br/>

    in the matter of manly strength,<br/>

    manly vigour<br/>

    and energy.</p>

    <p class="f4">For, monks, the fool does not thus consider:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Though this act is pleasant,<br/>

    yet it brings loss.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Accordingly he acts<br/>

    and the result is loss.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whereas the wise man thus reflects:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Though this act is pleasant,<br/>

    yet its results bring loss.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So he acts not<br/>

    and the result is to his profit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lastly, monks, in the case<br/>

    where action is both pleasant<br/>

    and profitable,<br/>

    one deems action advisable for both reasons,<br/>

    for it is both pleasant and profitable;<br/>

    that is why one deems action advisable.</p>

    <p class="f4">So these are the four occasions (of action).'</p>
