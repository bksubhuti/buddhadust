    <h1>Different Persons (a)</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4"> <span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span>  Now, monks, a certain person here,<br/>

    aloof from sense-desires,<br/>

    aloof from evil conditions,<br/>

    enters upon the first musing,<br/>

    which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    born of seclusion,<br/>

    zestful and easeful,<br/>

    and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">He enjoys<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> its sweetness,<br/>

    longs for it<br/>

    and finds happiness therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>

    given thereto,<br/>

    generally spending his time therein<br/>

    and not falling away therefrom,<br/>

    when he makes an end<br/>

    he is reborn in the company of devas of the Brahmā-group.</p>

    <p class="f4">A kalpa, monks, is the life-span<br/>

    of the devas of the Brahmā-group.<br/>

    Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>

    and spends his time<br/>

    according to the life-span of those devas;<br/>

    then he goes to purgatory<br/>

    or the womb of an animal,<br/>

    he goes to the peta-realm.<br/>

    But a disciple of the Exalted One,<br/>

    after staying there<br/>

    and spending his time<br/>

    according to the life-span of those devas,<br/>

    finally passes away in that same state.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, monks, is the distinction,<br/>

    such the specific feature,<br/>

    the difference between the learned Ariyan disciple<br/>

    and the unlearned ordinary man<br/>

    in the matter of bourn and rebirth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, a certain person here,<br/>

    by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    enters upon the second musing,<br/>

    that calming of the inner self,<br/>

    that one-pointedness of mind<br/>

    apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    that is born of mental balance,<br/>

    zestful and easeful,<br/>

    and having attained it<br/>

    abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">He enjoys its sweetness,<br/>

    longs for it<br/>

    and finds happiness therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>

    given thereto,<br/>

    generally spending his time therein<br/>

    and not falling away therefrom,<br/>

    when he makes an end<br/>

    he is reborn in the company of the Radiant devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, the life-span of those devas is two kalpas.<br/>

    Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>

    and spends his time<br/>

    according to the life-span of those devas;<br/>

    then he goes to purgatory<br/>

    or the womb of an animal,<br/>

    he goes to the peta-realm.<br/>

    But a disciple of the Exalted One,<br/>

    after staying there<br/>

    and spending his time<br/>

    according to the life-span of those devas,<br/>

    finally passes away in that same state.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, monks, is the distinction,<br/>

    such the specific feature,<br/>

    the difference between the learned Ariyan disciple<br/>

    and the unlearned ordinary man<br/>

    in the matter of bourn and rebirth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, a certain person here,<br/>

    by the fading out of zest,<br/>

    disinterested,<br/>

    mindful and composed,<br/>

    experiences in his  <span class="f2 g"><b>[131]</b></span>  own person<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    that ease of which the Ariyans declare:<br/>

    "He who is disinterested and alert<br/>

    dwells at ease,"<br/>

    — thus he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

    <p class="f4">He enjoys its sweetness,<br/>

    longs for it<br/>

    and finds happiness therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>

    given thereto,<br/>

    generally spending his time therein<br/>

    and not falling away therefrom,<br/>

    when he makes an end<br/>

    he is reborn in the company of the Ever-radiant<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, the life-span of those devas is four kalpas.<br/>

    Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>

    and spends his time<br/>

    according to the life-span of those devas;<br/>

    then he goes to purgatory<br/>

    or the womb of an animal,<br/>

    he goes to the peta-realm.<br/>

    But a disciple of the Exalted One,<br/>

    and the unlearned ordinary man<br/>

    in the matter of bourn and rebirth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Once more, monks, a certain person here,<br/>

    by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br/>

    by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br/>

    attains the fourth musing,<br/>

    a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br/>

    an equanimity of utter purity,<br/>

    and having attained it abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">He enjoys its sweetness,<br/>

    longs for it and finds happiness therein.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Established therein,<br/>

    given thereto,<br/>

    generally spending his time therein<br/>

    and not falling away therefrom,<br/>

    when he makes an end<br/>

    he is reborn in the company of the Vehapphala devas.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, the life-span of the Vehapphala devas is five hundred kalpas.<br/>

    Therein the ordinary man stays<br/>

    and spends his time<br/>

    according to the life-span of those devas;<br/>

    then he goes to purgatory<br/>

    or the womb of an animal,<br/>

    he goes to the peta-realm.<br/>

    But a disciple of the Exalted One,<br/>

    after staying there<br/>

    and spending his time<br/>

    according to the life-span of those devas,<br/>

    finally passes away in that same state.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, monks, is the distinction,<br/>

    such the specific feature,<br/>

    the difference between the learned Ariyan disciple<br/>

    and the unlearned ordinary man<br/>

    in the matter of bourn and rebirth.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, then, monks, are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Assādeti. Comy.</i> der. from <i>sādu</i> (sweet); <i>sukha-sādena assādeti, Cf. Pts. of Contr.</i> 258 (for the <i>kappa</i>), 278 (for the objection that such pleasure is disputable). At <i>G.S.</i> i, 245 in three instances he is reborn with devas having other qualities than these.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Kāyena,</i> as at § 87, 113; <i>Cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> v, 190</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> The question arises, as in note above, 'How can he enjoy or desire it, if he has become disinterested?'</p>
