    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[131]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, a certain person here,<br/>

    aloof from sense-desires,<br/>

    aloof from evil conditions,<br/>

    enters upon the first musing,<br/>

    which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    born of seclusion,<br/>

    zestful and easeful,<br/>

    and having attained it abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    feeling,<br/>

    perception,<br/>

    the activities,<br/>

    consciousness,<br/>

    those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br/>

    as Ill,<br/>

    as a disease,<br/>

    as an imposthume,<br/>

    as a barb,<br/>

    as pain,<br/>

    ill-health,<br/>

    alien,<br/>

    transitory,<br/>

    as empty<br/>

    and not of the self.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>

    he is reobrn in the company<br/>

    of the devas of the Pure Abodes.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, a certain person here,<br/>

    by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    enters upon the second musing,<br/>

    that calming of the inner self,<br/>

    that one-pointedness of mind<br/>

    apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    that is born of mental balance,<br/>

    zestful and easeful,<br/>

    and having attained it<br/>

    and having attained it abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br/>

    feeling,<br/>

    perception,<br/>

    the activities,<br/>

    consciousness,<br/>

    those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br/>

    as Ill,<br/>

    as a disease,<br/>

    as an imposthume,<br/>

    as a barb,<br/>

    as pain,<br/>

    ill-health,<br/>

    alien,<br/>

    transitory,<br/>

    as empty<br/>

    and not of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>

    he is reobrn in the company<br/>

    of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, a certain person here,<br/>

    by the fading out of zest,<br/>

    disinterested,<br/>

    mindful and composed,<br/>

    experiences in his own person<br/>

    that ease of which the Ariyans declare:<br/>

    "He who is disinterested and alert<br/>

    dwells at ease,"<br/>

    — thus he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

    <p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br/>

    feeling,<br/>

    perception,<br/>

    the activities,<br/>

    consciousness,<br/>

    those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br/>

    as Ill,<br/>

    as a disease,<br/>

    as an imposthume,<br/>

    as a barb,<br/>

    as pain,<br/>

    ill-health,<br/>

    alien,<br/>

    transitory,<br/>

    as empty<br/>

    and not of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>

    he is reobrn in the company<br/>

    of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Once more, monks, a certain person here,<br/>

    by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br/>

    by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br/>

    attains the fourth musing,<br/>

    a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br/>

    an equanimity of utter purity,<br/>

    and having attained it abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br/>

    feeling,<br/>

    perception,<br/>

    the activities,<br/>

    consciousness,<br/>

    those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br/>

    as Ill,<br/>

    as a disease,<br/>

    as an imposthume,<br/>

    as a barb,<br/>

    as pain,<br/>

    ill-health,<br/>

    alien,<br/>

    transitory,<br/>

    as empty<br/>

    and not of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>

    he is reobrn in the company<br/>

    of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

    <p class="f4">So these four persons are found existing in the world.'</p>
