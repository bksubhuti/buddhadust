    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][nymo]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person lives<br/>

    irradiating one quarter (of the world)<br/>

    with a heart possessed of amity;<br/>

    so also as to the second,<br/>

    third<br/>

    and fourth quarter of the world;<br/>

    and in like manner above,<br/>

    below,<br/>

    across,<br/>

    everywhere,<br/>

    for all sorts and conditions,<br/>

    he lives irradiating the whole world<br/>

    with a heart possessed of amity<br/>

    that is widespread,<br/>

    grown great<br/>

    and boundless,<br/>

    free from enmity<br/>

    and untroubled.</p>

    <p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br/>

    feeling,<br/>

    perception,<br/>

    the activities,<br/>

    consciousness,<br/>

    those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br/>

    as Ill,<br/>

    as a disease,<br/>

    as an imposthume,<br/>

    as a barb,<br/>

    as pain,<br/>

    ill-health,<br/>

    alien,<br/>

    transitory,<br/>

    as empty<br/>

    and not of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>

    he is reobrn in the company<br/>

    of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>
