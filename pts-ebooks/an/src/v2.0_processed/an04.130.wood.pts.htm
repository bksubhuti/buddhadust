    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four wonderful, marvellous things about a wheel-turning ruler.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">If a company of noblemen comes to visit a wheel-turning ruler, they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then if the ruler speaks they are delighted with what he says.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dissatisfied, monks, is a company of noblemen when the wheel-turning ruler becomes silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a company of brahmins comes to visit a wheel-turning ruler, they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then if the ruler speaks they are delighted with what he says.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dissatisfied, monks, is a company of brahmins when the wheel-turning ruler becomes silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a company of householders comes to visit a wheel-turning ruler, they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then if the ruler speaks they are delighted with what he says.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dissatisfied, monks, is a company of householders when the wheel-turning ruler becomes silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a company of noblemen comes to visit a wheel-turning ruler, they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then if the ruler speaks they are delighted with what he says.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dissatisfied, monks, is a company of recluses when the wheel-turning ruler becomes silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">These then, monks, are the four wonderful, marvellous things about a wheel-turning ruler.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks, there are four wonderful, marvellous things about Ānanda.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">If a company of monks comes to visit Ānanda,<br/>

    they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma,<br/>

    they are delighted with what he says.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of monks<br/>

    when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a company of nuns comes to visit Ānanda,<br/>

    they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma<br/>

    they are delighted with what he says.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of nuns<br/>

    when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a company of disciples who are laymen<br/>

    comes to visit Ānanda,<br/>

    they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma<br/>

    they are delighted with what he says.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of disciples who are laymen<br/>

    when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a company of disciples who are laywomen<br/>

    comes to visit Ānanda,<br/>

    they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma<br/>

    they are delighted with what he says.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of disciples<br/>

    that are laywomen<br/>

    when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the four wonderful, marvellous things about Ānanda.'</p>
