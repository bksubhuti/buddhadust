    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The blameworthy,<br/>

    the very blameworthy,<br/>

    the slightly blameworthy,<br/>

    the blameless.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person blameworthy?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>

    is liable to blame<br/>

    for his deeds in body,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is blameworthy.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person very blameworthy?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>

    is liable to much blame<br/>

    for his deeds in body,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and thought,<br/>

    and to slight blame<br/>

    for deeds that are blameless.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is more to be blamed than praised.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person only slightly blameworthy?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>

    is liable to little blame<br/>

    for his deeds in body,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and thought,<br/>

    and to little blame<br/>

    for deeds that are blameworthy.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is only slightly blameworthy.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is a person blameless?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain person<br/>

    is not to be blamed at all<br/>

    for his deeds in body,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is blameless.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four persons found existing in the world'</p>
