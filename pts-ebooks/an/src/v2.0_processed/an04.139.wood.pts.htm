    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four talkers of Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person talking Dhamma<br/>

    says little<br/>

    and that not to the point;<br/>

    while his company is unskilled to judge<br/>

    what is to the point<br/>

    or otherwise.</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">

    <p>Bhkkhu Bodhi's reading of this sutta is much better:<br/>

    One that talks little and that is off point with a following that is incompetent to judge and so considers him a Dhamma-talker;<br/>

    one that says much and that is off point with a following that is incompetent to judge and so considers him a Dhamma-talker;<br/>

    one that says little but that is on point and his company is competent to judge and so considers him a Dhamma-talker;<br/>

    one that says much and that is on point and his company is competent to judge and so considers him a Dhamma-talker.</p>
