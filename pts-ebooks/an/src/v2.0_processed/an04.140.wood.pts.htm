    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four expounders.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is the expounder<br/>

    who is at a loss<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> as regards the meaning<br/>

    but not the letter (of a passage).</p>

    <p class="f4">There is the expounder<br/>

    who is at a loss as regards the letter<br/>

    but not the meaning (of a passage).</p>

    <p class="f4">There is the expounder<br/>

    who is at a loss as regards the meaning<br/>

    and the letter (of a passage).</p>

    <p class="f4">And there is the expounder<br/>

    who is not at a loss either as regards the meaning<br/>

    or as regards the letter (of a passage).</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, it is unlikely,<br/>

    it is impossible<br/>

    that one possessed of the four analytical powers<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    should be at a loss<br/>

    both in the meaning<br/>

    and in the letter.'</p>
