    <h1>The Nun<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying at Kosambī, in Ghosita Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion a certain nun<br/>

    addressed a certain man, saying:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span> 'Come, thou good fellow!</p>

    <p class="f4">Go to master Ānanda,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    in my name worship with thy head<br/>

    the feet of the worthy Ānanda<br/>

    and say:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, a nun named so and so is sick,<br/>

    in pain,<br/>

    stricken with a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">She worships with her head<br/>

    the feet of the worthy Ānanda.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'And do you say this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It would be a good thing, sir,<br/>

    if the worthy Ānanda would visit the nuns' lodging<br/>

    where that nun is,<br/>

    out of compassion for her."'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lady,'replied that man,<br/>

    and went to the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, a nun named so and so is sick,<br/>

    in pain,<br/>

    stricken with a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">She worships with her head<br/>

    the feet of the worthy Ānanda.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"It would be a good thing, sir,<br/>

    if the worthy Ānanda would visit the nuns' lodging<br/>

    where that nun is,<br/>

    out of compassion for her."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br/>

    robing himself and taking bowl and outer robe,<br/>

    went to visit that nun.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now that nun saw the venerable Ānanda<br/>

    from afar as he was coming,<br/>

    and on seeing him<br/>

    she covered her head<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    and lay down on a couch.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to where she was,<br/>

    and on reaching her<br/>

    sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat there<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda said this to that nun:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[3][than][olds]</span>'Sister, this body has come into being through food,<br/>

    is dependent on craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sexual intercourse must be abandoned.</p>

    <p class="f4">The breaking down of the bridge<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    which is in sexual intercourse<br/>

    has been spoken of by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span> Sister, as to this saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This body has come into being through food,<br/>

    it was said in this connexion:</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, sister, a monk takes food<br/>

    with reflection and judgment,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    not for sport,<br/>

    not for indulgence,<br/>

    not for personal charm,<br/>

    not for beautifying,<br/>

    but just enough for the support,<br/>

    for the upkeep of body,<br/>

    for its resting unharmed,<br/>

    for helping the living of the God-life.</p>

    <p class="f4">(He takes food with the thought:)</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus do I check my former feeling<br/>

    and set going no new feeling;<br/>

    <p class="f4">Then some time later,<br/>

    though dependent on food,<br/>

    he abandons food.</p>

    we do acknowledge it of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">This indeed, sister,<br/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> asserts that she was enamoured of Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> It is contrary to Vinaya rules for a nun or female devotee (<i>Pāṭimokkha, Sekhiya</i>) to hear Dhamma with head covered or reclining or wearing sandals. Strangely <i>Comy.</i> does not notice it. But <i>cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> iv, 78 f., where a brahmin lady is rebuked by Udāyin for so doing.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> remarks that in order to disillusion her of her passion he spoke of the 'foul things '(<i>asubha-kathaṃ</i>).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Setu-ghāto = pada-ghāto, paccaya-ghato.</i> <i>Comy.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> i, 261; <i>Buddh. Psych. Eth.,</i> p. 87. Our text reads <i>methuno ca setughāto vutto</i> (which would mean 'sexual intercourse and bridge-breaking'); while the <i>Siamese</i> text reads <i>methune pahātabbo, methune setu-ghāto,</i> which is preferable. <i>Sinh.</i> text has <i>methune</i> only (the proper construction acc. to other passages where the phrase occurs). Here I follow the <i>Siamese</i> text. The saying is not recorded, as far as I know.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> ii, 98 (<i>Maṇsaputta</i>), iv, 104; <i>Expos,</i> ii, 511; <i>VM.</i> 31; <i>supra,</i> § 37. <i>Comy.</i> says nothing here nor at <i>S.</i> ii <i>loc. cit.,</i> but refers to <i>VM. loc. cit,</i> which equals <i>Expositor loc. cit.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Text omits <i>me.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>Kudassa nāma. Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> i, 107. For another word, <i>kudāssu</i> see <i>SA</i>. i, 124; <i>S.</i> ii, 5; <i>SA</i>. ii, 21 (<i>katarasmin nu kāle?</i>).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> Here out of delicacy, it seems, Ānanda does not expound further as in the case of the other failings. I bracket the words.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> The usual formula of repentance. <i>Cf.
