    <h1>[Modes of Progress] In Detail</h1>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[153]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four modes of progress.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The painful mode of progress with sluggish intuition,<br/>

    the painful mode with swift intuition,<br/>

    the pleasant mode of progress with sluggish intuition,<br/>

    the pleasant mode with swift intuition.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four modes of progress.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the mode of progress<br/>

    that is painful<br/>

    with sluggish intuition?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain one is by nature<br/>

    passionately lustful;<br/>

    he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise he is by nature<br/>

    passionately malicious;<br/>

    he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of malice.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise he is by nature<br/>

    passionately infatuated;<br/>

    he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of delusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">In such an one<br/>

    these five controlling faculties<br/>

    are dully <span class="f2 g"><b>[154]</b></span> manifested,<br/>

    to wit:<br/>

    the controlling faculty of faith,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>

    and the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, owing to the dullness of these five faculties,<br/>

    sluggish is his attainment<br/>

    of the concentration that follows on<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the progress that is painful<br/>

    with sluggish intuition."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the mode of progress<br/>

    that is painful<br/>

    but with swift intuition?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain one is by nature<br/>

    passionately lustful;<br/>

    he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise he is by nature<br/>

    passionately malicious;<br/>

    he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of malice.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise he is by nature<br/>

    passionately infatuated;<br/>

    he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of delusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">In such an one<br/>

    these five controlling faculties<br/>

    are manifested in abundance,<br/>

    to wit:<br/>

    the controlling faculty of faith,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>

    and the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, owing to the preponderance of these five faculties,<br/>

    swift is his attainment<br/>

    of the concentration that follows on<br/>

    for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the progress that is painful<br/>

    but with swift intuition."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the mode of progress<br/>

    that is pleasant,<br/>

    but with sluggish intuition?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain one<br/>

    is not by nature passionately lustful;<br/>

    he does not experience the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nor is he by nature passionately malicious;<br/>

    he does not experience the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of malice.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nor is he by nature passionately infatuated;<br/>

    he does not experience the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of delusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">But in such an one<br/>

    these five controlling faculties<br/>

    are dully manifested,<br/>

    to wit:<br/>

    the controlling faculty of faith,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>

    and the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, owing to the dullness of the five faculties,<br/>

    sluggish is his attainment<br/>

    of the concentration that follows on<br/>

    for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, <span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span> is called<br/>

    "the mode of progress that is pleasant,<br/>

    but with sluggish intuition."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the mode of progress that is both pleasant<br/>

    and accompanied by swift intuition?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain one is not by nature passionately lustful;<br/>

    he does not experience the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nor is he by nature passionately malicious;<br/>

    he does not experience the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of malice.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nor is he by nature passionately infatuated;<br/>

    he does not experience the perpetual pain and dejection<br/>

    that are born of delusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">And in such an one these five controlling faculties are manifested in abundance, to wit:<br/>

    the controlling faculty of faith,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>

    the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Thus, owing to the preponderance of the five faculties,<br/>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the mode of progress that is both pleasant<br/>

    and accompanied by swift intuition."</p>

    <p class="f4">So these are the four modes of progress.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Ānantariyaṃ (sc. samādhiṃ).</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>VM.</i> ii, 675, which quotes our sutta, and <i>Sn.</i> 226:</p>

    <p class="in4">Yaṃ Buddha-seṭṭho parivaṇṇayi suciṃ<br/>

    Samādhiṃ ānantarikaṃ nam āhu.</p>

    <p class="lgqt">This failure to attain is due to the hindrances (<i>cf.</i> <i>Expos.</i> i, 244) - <i>i.e.,</i> it is difficult for him to give up the lower nature without a great struggle. This painful progress is described in § 163.</p>
