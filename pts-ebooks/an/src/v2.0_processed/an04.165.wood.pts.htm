    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four modes of progress.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The mode of progress that is impatient,<br/>

    that which is patient,<br/>

    that which tames,<br/>

    and the mode of progress that calms.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the mode of progress that is impatient?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain one<br/>

    is impatient of cold,<br/>

    heat,<br/>

    hunger,<br/>

    thirst,<br/>

    the contact of flies,<br/>

    mosquitoes,<br/>

    of wind<br/>

    and sun<br/>

    and creeping things.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is impatient of abusive,<br/>

    pain-causing ways of speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is impatient of painful bodily feelings,<br/>

    grievous,<br/>

    sharp,<br/>

    racking,<br/>

    distracting<br/>

    and discomforting,<br/>

    that drain the life away.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the impatient mode of progress."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is the patient mode of progress?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a certain one is patient of cold,<br/>

    heat,<br/>

    hunger,<br/>

    thirst,<br/>

    the contact of flies,<br/>

    mosquitoes,<br/>

    of wind<br/>

    and sun<br/>

    and creeping things.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is patient of abusive,<br/>

    pain-causing ways of speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is patient of painful bodily feelings,<br/>

    "the patient mode of progress."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the mode of progress that tames?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a monk,<br/>

    seeing an object with the eye,<br/>

    is not misled by its outer view<br/>

    nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil, unprofitable states,<br/>

    might flow in upon one<br/>

    who lives with the faculty of the eye uncontrolled,<br/>

    he applies himself to control of the faculty of eye,<br/>

    sets a guard over the faculty of eye,<br/>

    attains control over the faculty of eye.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he hears a sound with the ear,<br/>

    he is not misled by its outer view<br/>

    nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil, unprofitable states,<br/>

    might flow in upon one<br/>

    who lives with the faculty of the ear uncontrolled,<br/>

    he applies himself to control of the faculty of ear,<br/>

    sets a guard over the faculty of ear,<br/>

    attains control over the faculty of ear.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he with the nose smells a scent,<br/>

    he is not misled by its outer view<br/>

    nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil, unprofitable states,<br/>

    might flow in upon one<br/>

    he applies himself to control of the faculty of nose,<br/>

    sets a guard over the faculty of nose,<br/>

    attains control over the faculty of nose.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he with the tongue tastes a savour,<br/>

    he is not misled by its outer view<br/>

    nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil, unprofitable states,<br/>

    might flow in upon one<br/>

    who lives with the faculty of the tongue uncontrolled,<br/>

    he applies himself to control of the faculty of tongue,<br/>

    sets a guard over the faculty of tongue,<br/>

    attains control over the faculty of tongue.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he with body contacts tangibles,<br/>

    he is not misled by its outer view<br/>

    nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil, unprofitable states,<br/>

    might flow in upon one<br/>

    who lives with the faculty of the body uncontrolled,<br/>

    he applies himself to control of the faculty of body,<br/>

    sets a guard over the faculty of body,<br/>

    attains control over the faculty of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">When with mind he cognizes mental states,<br/>

    he is not misled by its outer view<br/>

    nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>

    evil, unprofitable states,<br/>

    might flow in upon one<br/>

    who lives with the faculty of the mind uncontrolled,<br/>

    he applies himself to control of the faculty of mind,<br/>

    sets a guard over the faculty of mind,<br/>

    attains control over the faculty of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/>

    "the mode of progress that tames."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the mode of progress that calms?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[159]</b></span> In this case a monk admits not<br/>

    sensual thinking that has arisen.</p>

    <p class="f4">He abandons,<br/>

    restrains,<br/>

    calms it down,<br/>

    makes an end of it,<br/>

    forces it not to recur.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also a monk admits not<br/>

    malicious thinking that has arisen.</p>

    <p class="f4">He abandons,<br/>

    restrains,<br/>

    calms it down,<br/>

    makes an end of it,<br/>

    <p class="f4">So also a monk admits not<br/>

    harmful thinking that has arisen.</p>

    <p class="f4">He abandons,<br/>

    restrains,<br/>

    calms it down,<br/>

    makes an end of it,<br/>

    forces it not to recur.</p>

    <p class="f4">He does not admit evil,<br/>

    unprofitable states<br/>

    that occur from time to time;<br/>

    he abandons them,<br/>

    restrains,<br/>

    calms them down,<br/>

    makes an end of them,<br/>

    forces them not to recur.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    "the mode of progress that calms."</p>

    <p class="f4">So these are the four modes of progress.'</p>
