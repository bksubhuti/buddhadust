    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[159]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four modes of progress.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The mode of progress that is painful<br/>

    with sluggish intuition,<br/>

    the mode of progress that is painful<br/>

    with swift intuition,<br/>

    the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>

    with sluggish intuition,<br/>

    and the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>

    and accompanied with swift intuition.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now here, monks, the mode of progress that is painful<br/>

    with sluggish intuition<br/>

    is reckoned low<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in both respects,<br/>

    both as regards its pain<br/>

    and its sluggishness.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is reckoned low in both respects.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br/>

    the mode of progress that is painful<br/>

    with swift intuition<br/>

    is reckoned low in respect of its being painful.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br/>

    the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>

    with sluggish intuition<br/>

    is reckoned low in respect of its being sluggish.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet again, monks, the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>

    with swift intuition<br/>

    is reckoned excellent in both respects,<br/>

    both as regards its pleasantness<br/>

    and its swiftness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is reckoned excellent in both respects.</p>

    <p class="f4">So these are the four modes of progress.'</p>
