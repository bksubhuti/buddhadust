    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Moggallāna the Great went to visit the venerable Sāriputta, and on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>

    and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the venerable Moggallāna the Great said this to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sāriputta your reverence,<br/>

    there are these four modes of progress.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The mode of progress that is painful<br/>

    with sluggish intuition,<br/>

    the mode of progress that is painful<br/>

    with swift intuition,<br/>

    the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>

    with sluggish intuition,<br/>

    and the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>

    and accompanied with swift intuition.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, your reverence,<br/>

    by way of which of these four modes of progress<br/>

    was your heart released from the āsavas without grasping?</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Moggallāna, your reverence,<br/>

    there are four modes of progress.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The mode of progress that is painful<br/>

    with sluggish intuition,<br/>

    the mode of progress that is painful<br/>

    with swift intuition,<br/>

    the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>

    with sluggish intuition,<br/>

    and the mode of progress that is pleasant<br/>

    and accompanied with swift intuition.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now of these four<br/>

    the one I followed<br/>

    was the mode of progress that is pleasant,<br/>

    with swift intuition.</p>

    <p class="f4">By way of this mode of progress<br/>

    was my heart released from the āsavas without grasping.'</p>
