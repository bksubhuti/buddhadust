    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Venerable Ānanda addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend sirs."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Your reverence," replied those monks to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Ānanda said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, when anyone,<br/>

    be it monk or nun,<br/>

    proclaims in my presence<br/>

    that he has attained arahantship,<br/>

    all such do so by virtue of four factors<br/>

    or one of these four.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are they?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, your reverences,<br/>

    a monk develops insight<br/>

    preceded by calm.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him thus developing insight<br/>

    preceded by calm<br/>

    is born the Way.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He follows along that Way,<br/>

    makes it grow,<br/>

    makes much of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him following,<br/>

    developing,<br/>

    making much of that Way,<br/>

    the fetters are abandoned,<br/>

    the lurking tendencies<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> come to an end.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or again, your reverences,<br/>

    a monk develops calm<br/>

    preceded by insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him developing calm<br/>

    preceded by insight<br/>

    is born the Way.</p>

    <p class="f4">He follows along that Way,<br/>

    makes it grow,<br/>

    makes much of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him following,<br/>

    developing,<br/>

    making much of that Way,<br/>

    the fetters are abandoned,<br/>

    the lurking tendencies come to an end.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet again, your reverences,<br/>

    a monk develops calm-and- <span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span> insight coupled.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"> In him thus developing calm-and-insight coupled<br/>

    the Way is born.</p>

    <p class="f4">He follows along that Way,<br/>

    makes it grow,<br/>

    makes much of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him following,<br/>

    developing,<br/>

    making much of that Way,<br/>

    the fetters are abandoned,<br/>

    the lurking tendencies come to an end.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Once more, your reverences,<br/>

    a monk's mind<br/>

    is utterly cleared of perplexities about Dhamma.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That is the time, your reverences,<br/>

    when his thought<br/>

    stands fixed in the very self,<br/>

    settles down,<br/>

    becomes one-pointed,<br/>

    is composed.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him the Way is born.</p>

    <p class="f4">He follows along that Way,<br/>

    makes it grow,<br/>

    makes much of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him following,<br/>

    developing,<br/>

    making much of that Way,<br/>

    the fetters are abandoned,<br/>

    the lurking tendencies come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, your reverences,<br/>

    when anyone,<br/>

    be it monk or nun,<br/>

    proclaims in my presence<br/>

    that he has attained arahantship,<br/>

    all such do so by virtue of four factors<br/>

    or one of these four.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Here our text reads <i>dhamm'uddhacca-vigahītamanā, (?) hoti.

Apparently we should begin the next sentence with <i>Hoti so samayo</i> (as does <i>Comy.</i>) or repeat <i>hoti.</i> The process is explained at length <i>Pṭs.</i> ii, 100 <i>ff.</i></p>
