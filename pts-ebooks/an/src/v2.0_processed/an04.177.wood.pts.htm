    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> Now the venerable Rāhula came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>

    the Exalted One said this<br/>

    to the venerable Rāhula:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span>"Rāhula, both the earth-element in the self<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    and that in external objects<br/>

    are just this earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus should it be regarded,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    by perfect wisdom:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not of me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not this am I.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not to me is this the self.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing it,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    by perfect wisdom,<br/>

    one has revulsion for the earth-element;<br/>

    by wisdom one cleanses the heart of passion.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Rāhula, both the water-element in oneself<br/>

    and that in external objects<br/>

    are just this water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus should it be regarded,<br/>

    by perfect wisdom:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not of me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not this am I.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not to me is this the self.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing it,<br/>

    by wisdom one cleanses the heart of passion.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Rāhula, both the heat-element in oneself<br/>

    and that in external objects<br/>

    are just this heat-element.</p>

    <p><i>Vāyo-dhātu.</i> Wind-. Characteristic of movement. Not 'air.' OK, so the word 'air' is possibly related to the Greek αε̄τε̄ς, wind, [Websters] but that is not how it is understood and as is does not point to motion.</p>
