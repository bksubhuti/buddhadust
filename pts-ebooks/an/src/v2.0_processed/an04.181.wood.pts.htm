    <h1>Fighting Man</h1>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>

    a fighting-man is worthy of a rajah,<br/>

    is a possession of a rajah,<br/>

    is reckoned an attribute of a rajah.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a fighting-man is skilled in points of vantage,<br/>

    he is a far-shooter,<br/>

    a shooter like lightning<br/>

    and a piercer<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of a huge object.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br/>

    a fighting-man is worthy of a rajah,<br/>

    is a possession of a rajah,<br/>

    is reckoned an attribute of a rajah.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">In like manner, monks,<br/>

    possessed of four qualities<br/>

    a monk is worthy of respect,<br/>

    of offerings and gifts,<br/>

    of being saluted with clasped hands upraised,<br/>

    a field of merit<br/>

    unsurpassed for the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span> In this case a monk is skilled in points of vantage,<br/>

    he is a far-shooter,<br/>

    a shooter like lightning<br/>

    and a piercer of a huge object.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now in what way is a monk skilled in points of vantage?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a monk is virtuous,<br/>

    he dwells restrained<br/>

    with the restraint of the Obligations;<br/>

    perfect in the practice of right conduct<br/>

    he sees danger in the slightest faults;<br/>

    he takes up<br/>

    and trains himself<br/>

    in the rules of morality.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is a monk skilled in points of vantage.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is a monk a far-shooter?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein whatsoever object,<br/>
