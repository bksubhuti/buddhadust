    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[184]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a certain monk came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat thus<br/>

    that monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Pray, lord, by what is the world led?</p>

    <p class="f4">By what is the world drawn along?</p>

    <p class="f4">Under the sway of what that has arisen<br/>

    does it go?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Well, said!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, monk!</p>

    <p class="f4">Happy is your approach to a question,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    happy is your ready wit<br/>

    and goodly is your <span class="f2 g"><b>[185]</b></span> questioning.</p>

    <p class="f4">Your question is thus, is it not, monk?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, by what is the world led?</p>

    <p class="f4">By what is the world drawn along?</p>

    <p class="f4">Under the sway of what that has arisen does it go?"</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, monk, the world is led by thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">By thought it is drawn along.</p>

    <p class="f4">When thought has arisen, it goes under its sway.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is well said, lord,'<br/>

    replied that monk,<br/>

    welcoming what was said by the Exalted One,<br/>

    and after thanking him<br/>

    asked another question:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'As to the common saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Widely learned,<br/>

    one who knows Dhamma by heart" -</p>

    <p class="f4">pray, lord, of what sort<br/>

    is one widely learned,<br/>

    who knows Dhamma by heart?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well said!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, monk!</p>

    <p class="f4">Happy is your approach to a question,<br/>

    happy is your ready wit<br/>

    and goodly is your questioning.</p>

    <p class="f4">You ask this, do you not?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, of what sort<br/>

    is one widely learned,<br/>

    who knows Dhamma by heart?"</p>

    <p class="f4">'I do, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, monk, I have taught Dhamma widely, -<br/>

    <i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākarana, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhu-tadhamma</i> and <i>Vedalla.</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now if a monk understands<br/>

    the meaning and (text of) Dhamma, -<br/>

    even if it be but a stanza of four lines,-<br/>

    and be set on living in accordance with Dhamma,<br/>

    he may well be called</p>

    <p class="f4">"One widely learned,<br/>

    who knows Dhamma by heart."'</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is well said, lord,'<br/>

    replied that monk,<br/>

    welcoming what <span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span> was said by the Exalted One,<br/>

    and after thanking him<br/>

    asked another question:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'As to the common saying, lord,</p>

    <p class="f4">"Learned, of penetrative wisdom" -</p>

    <p class="f4">pray, lord, of what sort is one learned, of penetrative wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well said!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, monk!</p>

    <p class="f4">Happy is your approach to a question,<br/>

    happy is your ready wit<br/>

    and goodly is your questioning.</p>

    <p class="f4">You ask this, do you not?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, of what sort is one learned,<br/>

    of penetrative wisdom?"</p>

    <p class="f4">'I do, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'In this case, monk, a monk hears it said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is Ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">By wisdom he penetrates the meaning of that saying<br/>

    and sees that it is so.</p>

    <p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is the arising of Ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">By wisdom he penetrates the meaning of that saying<br/>

    and sees that it is so.</p>

    <p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is the ending of Ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">By wisdom he penetrates the meaning of that saying<br/>

    and sees that it is so.</p>

    <p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is the practice going to the ending of Ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">By wisdom he penetrates the meaning of that saying<br/>

    and sees that it is so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monk, he is learned,<br/>

    of penetrative wisdom.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is well said, lord,'<br/>

    replied that monk,<br/>

    welcoming what was said by the Exalted One,<br/>

    and after thanking him<br/>

    asked another question:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'As to the common saying</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wise, of great wisdom,"</p>

    <p class="f4">pray, lord, of what sort is one who is wise,<br/>

    of great wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well said!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, monk!</p>

    <p class="f4">Happy is your approach to a question,<br/>

    happy is your ready wit<br/>

    and goodly is your questioning.</p>

    <p class="f4">You ask this, do you not?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, of what sort is one who is wise,<br/>

    of great wisdom?"</p>

    <p class="f4">'I do, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, monk, in this case<br/>

    he who is wise,<br/>

    of great wisdom,<br/>

    thinks not with a view to harm<br/>

    either himself<br/>

    or another<br/>

    or both alike.</p>

    <p class="f4">So thinking<br/>

    he thinks with a view<br/>

    to the profit of self,<br/>

    of another,<br/>

    both of self and of another,<br/>

    to the profit of the whole world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monk, one is wise,<br/>

    of great wisdom.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Ummagga.</i> The <i>uddāna,</i> calls it <i>ummanga,</i> as at <i>Vin.</i> v, 144. See <i>n.</i> below.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The question is put in verse at <i>S.</i> i, 39:</p>

    <p class="in4"><i>Kenassu nīyati loko, kenassu parilcassati?<br/>

    Kissassa ekadhammassa sabbe'va vasam anvagu?</i>|| ||</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><i>Parikassati = ākaḍḍhīyati.</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Bhaddaka te ummaggo.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Vin.</i> v, 144; <i>S.</i> v, 16, where Bhadda (Lucky) is the questioner. It may be a pun on his name, and the 'certain monk' here may be he. <i>Ummaggo</i> (tunnel or boring; in mining called 'upcast'); the <i>Ummagga-Jātaka</i> (the last but one in <i>JA</i>.): = <i>paññā-gamanaṃ.</i> <i>Comy.</i> But <i>cf.</i> <i>J.R.A.S.,</i> July, 1931, where Mr. E. H. Johnston discusses several Pāli words, this one amongst them, and points out that <i>Comy.</i> should probably read <i>pañha-ummaggo</i> here, which I think likely. I have previously trans. it 'penetration' (<i>K.S.</i> v, 16), but he thinks it means 'emergence of a desire for knowledge leading to questioning,' and refers to <i>ummujja-nimmujja,</i> connecting it with Skt. <i>unmiñjita-nimiñjita.</i> We have the word again below, p. 189 [AN 4.192, n9] of text. <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> iv, 261 <i>(bhaddaka-magga).</i> My edition of <i>SA.</i> iii on <i>S.</i> v, 16 has <i>paññā-ummagga paññā-vīmaṇsana, paññā-gavesanaṃ</i> (my <i>Sinh.</i> MSS.), and Burmese <i>paññā-umango</i> (sic), which Mr. Johnston quotes (probably from the Siamese ed.) as <i>pañhumango, pañhāmaggo,</i> etc. <i>Comy.</i> on our passage (<i>Sinh.</i> printed ed.f 1904, p. 581, and my palm-leaf MS.) is: <i>ummaggo ti, ummujjanaṃ paññā-gamanan ti attho; paññā eva vā ummujjan'atthena ummaggo ti vuccati</i> (where again Mr. Johnston reads <i>ummango ... ummujjanatthaṃ ummango ti?).</i> See my note below on p. 189 of text. [Ed.?]</p>
