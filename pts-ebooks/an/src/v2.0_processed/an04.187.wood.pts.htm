    <h1>Vassakāra</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha in Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahmin Vassakāra,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    a great official of Magadha,<br/>

    came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him greeted him courteously.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having greeted him courteously<br/>

    he took a seek to one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>

    the <span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span> brahmin Vassakāra,<br/>

    a great official of Magadha<br/>

    said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Pray, master Gotama,<br/>

    could a bad man<br/>

    recognize a bad man<br/>

    (so as to say):</p>

    <p class="f4">"This worthy is a bad man"?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is out of place, brahmin;<br/>

    it is an impossibility<br/>

    for a bad man<br/>

    to recognize a bad man<br/>

    (so as to say):</p>

    <p class="f4">"This worthy is a bad man"'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Then pray, master Gotama,<br/>

    could a bad man<br/>

    recognize a good man<br/>

    (so as to say):</p>

    <p class="f4">"This worthy is a good man"?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is out of place, brahmin;<br/>

    it is an impossibility<br/>

    for a bad man<br/>

    to recognize a good man<br/>

    <p class="f4">"This worthy is a good man"?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Then could a good man<br/>

    recognize a good man<br/>

    (so as to say):</p>

    <p class="f4">"This worthy is a good man"?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'That, brahmin, is a likely thing.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is possible for a good man<br/>

    to recognize a good man<br/>

    (so as to say):</p>

    <p class="f4">"This worthy is a good man"'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Again, master Gotama,<br/>

    could a good man<br/>

    recognize a bad man<br/>

    (so as to say):</p>

    <p class="f4">"This worthy is a bad man"?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'That again, brahmin, is a likely thing.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is possible for a good man<br/>

    (so as to say):</p>

    <p class="f4">"This worthy is a bad man."'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is marvellous, master Gotama,<br/>

    how well said is this<br/>

    by the worshipful Gotama, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is out of place, brahmin;<br/>

    it is an impossibility<br/>

    for a bad<br/>

    man to recognize a bad man<br/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br/>

    on a certain occasion<br/>

    the company of the brāhmin Todeyya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    were talking abusively, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"A fool is the rājah Eḷeyya<br/>

    to be pleased with Rāma's son, the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why! he even went so far<br/>

    as to show the greatest humility before him,<br/>

    such as saluting him,<br/>

    rising up in his presence,<br/>

    putting his hands together<br/>

    and doing homage to him.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover the retinue of the rājah Eḷeyya,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span> such as Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindaki, Gandhabba and Aggivessa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    are fools to be pleased with Rama's son, the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">They too went so far<br/>

    as to show the greatest humility before him,<br/>

    such as saluting him,<br/>

    rising up in his presence,<br/>

    putting his hands together<br/>

    and doing homage to him."'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, brahmin, you see<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    that's just how the brāhmin Todeyya<br/>

    leads them by the nose.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think those worthies:</p>

    <p class="f4">"A wise man is the rājah Eḷeyya.</p>

    <p class="f4">Among those superior in insight<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

    in deciding matters of dispute<br/>

    and in the interpretation of terms<br/>

    he is superior," -</p>

    <p class="f4">Do they think that?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'They do, sir.</p>

    <p class="f4">They think:</p>

    <p class="f4">"A wise man is the rājah Eḷeyya.</p>

    <p class="f4">Among those superior in insight<br/>

    in deciding matters of dispute<br/>

    and in the interpretation of terms<br/>

    he is superior."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And it is just because the recluse, Rāma's son,<br/>

    is wiser than the wise rājah Eḷeyya<br/>

    and superior to him in insight<br/>

    in deciding matters of dispute<br/>

    and in the interpretation of terms<br/>

    in a still higher degree, -<br/>

    it is for this reason<br/>

    that the rajah Eḷeyya<br/>

    is pleased with him<br/>

    and shows the greatest humility before him,<br/>

    such as saluting him,<br/>

    rising up in his presence,<br/>

    putting his hands together<br/>

    and doing homage to him."'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what think those worthies:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wise is the retinue of the rajah Eḷeyya; namely, Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindaki, Gandhabba and Aggivessa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Among those superior in insight<br/>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And it is just because the recluse, Rāma's son,<br/>

    is wiser than the wise retinue of the rājah Eḷeyya<br/>

    and superior to them in insight<br/>

    in deciding matters of dispute<br/>

    and in the interpretation of terms<br/>

    in a still higher degree, -<br/>

    it is for this reason<br/>

    that the retinue of the <i>rājah Eḷeyya</i><br/>

    are highly pleased with the recluse, Rāma's son, and (in their turn)<br/>

    show the greatest humility before him,<br/>

    such as saluting him,<br/>

    rising up in his presence,<br/>

    putting their hands together<br/>

    and doing homage to him."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">It is wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is marvellous<br/>

    how well said was this by the worshipful Gotama, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is out of place, brahmin;<br/>

    it is an impossibility<br/>

    for a bad man<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span> to recognize a bad man<br/>

    <p class="f4">Well, master Gotama, I must be going.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am a busy man and have much to do.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do as you think proper, brahmin.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So the brahmin Vassakāra,<br/>

    the great official of Magadha,<br/>

    being pleased with the words of the Exalted One,<br/>

    thanked him,<br/>

    rose from his seat<br/>

    and went away.</p>
