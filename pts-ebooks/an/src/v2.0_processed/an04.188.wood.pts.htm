    <h1>Upaka</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha on Vultures' Peak Hill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Upaka, son of Maṇḍika,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Upaka, son of Maṇḍika, said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'As for me, sir, I say this,<br/>

    I hold this view:</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever starts abusive talk about another<br/>

    and carries it on,<br/>

    but cannot in every way make good his case,<br/>

    in failing to do so<br/>

    should be held blameworthy<br/>

    and guilty of offence.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, Upaka, if he does so<br/>

    he is to be held blameworthy<br/>

    and guilty of offence.</p>

    <p class="f4">You yourself also,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Upaka,<br/>

    start abusive talk about another<br/>

    and carry it on.</p>

    <p class="f4">So doing<br/>

    and failing to make good your case,<br/>

    you are to be held blameworthy<br/>

    and guilty of offence.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">'There, sir!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just like a man catching (his prey) with a big noose<br/>

    as soon as it puts its head out,<br/>

    even so am I caught by the Exalted One<br/>

    with the big noose of words<br/>

    as soon as I open my mouth!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span> 'Upaka, I have pointed out:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This thing is wrong,"</p>

    <p class="f4">and that too in endless variation of word,<br/>

    syllable<br/>

    and Dhamma-teaching of a Tathāgata.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So also, Upaka, have I pointed out:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This thing is right,"</p>

    <p class="f4">and that too in endless variations of word,<br/>

    syllable<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    and Dhamma-teaching of a Tathāgata.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Upaka, I have pointed out:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This thing is right,"</p>

    <p class="f4">and</p>

    <p class="f4">"This thing that is right<br/>

    must be made to grow."</p>

    <p class="f4">This thing that is right, Upaka,<br/>

    must be made to grow.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Upaka, son of Maṇḍika, was pleased with the words of the Exalted One,<br/>

    and after thanking him<br/>

    rose up from his seat and,<br/>

    saluting the Exalted One by keeping his right side towards him,<br/>

    went away to the rajah of Magadha, Ajātasattu, son of the Videhan.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">On coming to him<br/>

    he related all the talk he had had with the Exalted One<br/>

    from beginning to end.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the rajah of Magadha, Ajātasattu, son of the Videhan,<br/>

    was angry<br/>

    and in his displeasure exclaimed to Upaka, son of Maṇḍika:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What a pestilent fellow<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

    is this salt-worker's boy!</p>

    <p class="f4">A scurrilous shameless rogue!</p>

    <p class="f4">To think that he should presume to revile that Exalted One,<br/>

    the Arahant,<br/>

    the Fully Enlightened One!</p>

    <p class="f4">Away with you, Upaka!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let me see you no more!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>This does not fit the story of the Upaka who first heard Dhamma. After giving up the <i>ājivaka</i> life for a woman, and the woman dispising him for that, he again gave up household life and according to the story went straight to Gotama to become a bhikkhu.</p>
