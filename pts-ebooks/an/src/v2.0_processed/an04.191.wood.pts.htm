    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, four advantages are to be looked for<br/>

    from the frequent verbal practice<br/>

    of teachings heard with the ear,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    from considering them in the mind,<br/>

    from thoroughly penetrating them by view.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākarana, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhu-tadhamma</i> and <i>Vedalla.</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Those teachings heard with the ear,<br/>

    often practised verbally,<br/>

    considered by the mind,<br/>

    are thoroughly penetrated by view.</p>

    <p class="f4">He making an end<br/>

    with <span class="f2 g"><b>[194]</b></span> memory confused<br/>

    is reborn in a certain company of devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the happy ones<br/>

    recite to him Dhamma-verses.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Slow to arise in him, monks,<br/>

    is memory,<br/>

    but that being very quickly reaches excellencc.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the first advantage to be looked for<br/>

    from the frequent verbal practice<br/>

    of teachings heard with the ear,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Then again, a monk masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

    one who has won mastery of mind,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    is teaching Dhamma to a company of devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurs to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">Why, this is just<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> the Dhamma-discipline<br/>

    according to which<br/>

    formerly I practised the God-life!</p>

    is memory,<br/>

    but that being very quickly reaches excellence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It is just as if a man<br/>

    skilled in the sound of drums,<br/>

    <p class="f4">He would have no doubt or uncertainty<br/>

    as to whether it was the sound of a drum or not,<br/>

    but would just conclude that it was so.</p>
