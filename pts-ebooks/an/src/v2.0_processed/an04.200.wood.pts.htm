    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these four things are born.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of affection is born affection,<br/>

    of affection is born ill-will.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of ill-will is born affection,<br/>

    of ill-will is born ill-will.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is affection born of affection?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br/>

    one person is dear,<br/>

    pleasant,<br/>

    delightful<br/>

    to another person.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then others treat<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> that one as dear,<br/>

    <p class="f4">The former thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">He who is dear,<br/>

    pleasant<br/>

    and delightful to me<br/>

    is treated by others also as dear,<br/>

    pleasant<br/>

    and delightful.</p>

    <p class="f4">So he conceives affection for them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, is affection born of affection.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, at such time as a monk,<br/>

    aloof from sense-desires,<br/>

    aloof from evil conditions,<br/>

    enters upon the first musing,<br/>

    which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    born of seclusion,<br/>

    zestful and easeful,<br/>

    and abides therein,<br/>

    the affection that is born of affection<br/>

    exists not at all,<br/>

    <p class="f4">At such time as a monk, by calming down thought directed and sustained<br/>

    of thought directed and sustained<br/>

    he attains and abides in the second musing,<br/>

    that inward calming,<br/>

    that single-mindedness<br/>

    apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>

    that is born of mental balance,<br/>

    zestful and easeful,<br/>

    the affection that is born of affection<br/>

    exists not at all,<br/>

    disinterested,<br/>

    mindful and composed,<br/>

    he experiences with body<br/>

    that ease<br/>

    of which the Ariyans declare:</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who is disinterested and alert,<br/>

    dwells at ease,"</p>

    <p class="f4">At such time as a monk, by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br/>

    by the ending of both the happiness and unhappiness he had before,<br/>

    he attains and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>

    a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br/>

    an equanimity of utter purity,<br/>

    the affection that is born of affection<br/>

    exists not at all,<br/>
