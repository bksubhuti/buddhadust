    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you the unworthy man<br/>

    and the still more unworthy man.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will teach you the worthy man<br/>

    and the still more worthy man.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it carefully.</p>

    <p class="f4">Apply your minds and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,'<br/>

    replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'And of what sort, monks, is the unworthy man?</p>
