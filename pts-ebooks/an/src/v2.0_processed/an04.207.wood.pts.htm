    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you the wicked man<br/>

    and the still more wicked man.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will teach you the goodly man<br/>

    and the still more goodly man.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it carefully.</p>

    <p class="f4">Apply your minds and I will speak."</p>
