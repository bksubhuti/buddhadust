    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessing four qualities<br/>

    one is put into purgatory<br/>

    according to his deserts.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">One who says he has not seen what he has seen,<br/>

    one who says he has not heard what he has heard,<br/>

    one who says he has not sensed what he has sensed,<br/>

    one who says he has not cognized what he has cognized.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four.</p>
