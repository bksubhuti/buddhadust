    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessing four qualities<br/>

    the foolish,<br/>

    sinful,<br/>

    unworthy man<br/>

    carries about with him<br/>

    an uprooted,<br/>

    lifeless self,<br/>

    is blameworthy,<br/>

    is censured by the intelligent<br/>

    and begets much demerit.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Taking life,<br/>

    stealing,<br/>

    wrong conduct in sense-desires<br/>

    falsehood.</p>
