    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four states.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">There are states to be comprehended by higher knowledge,<br/>

    states to be abandoned by higher knowledge,<br/>

    states to be made more of by higher knowledge<br/>

    and states to be realized by higher knowledge.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, are the states<br/>

    to be comprehended by higher knowledge?</p>

    <p class="f4">The five factors of grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are called<br/>

    "states to be comprehended by higher knowledge."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, are the states<br/>

    to be abandoned by higher knowledge?</p>

    <p class="f4">Ignorance and the craving for becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are called<br/>

    "states to be abandoned by higher knowledge."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, are the states<br/>

    to be made more of by higher knowledge?</p>

    <p class="f4">Calm and insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are called<br/>

    "states to be made more of by higher knowledge."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, are the states<br/>

    to be realized by higher knowledge?</p>

    <p class="f4">Knowledge and release.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are called<br/>

    "states to be realized by higher knowledge."</p>

    <p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four states.</p>
