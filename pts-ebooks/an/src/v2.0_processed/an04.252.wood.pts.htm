    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[252]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four un-Ariyan quests.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one,<br/>

    being in himself subject to decay,<br/>

    seeks after that of which the nature is decay.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being in himself subject to disease,<br/>

    he seeks after that of which the nature is death.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being in himself subject to death,<br/>

    he seeks after that of which the nature is death.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being in himself subject to defilement,<br/>

    he seeks after that of which the nature is defilement.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four un-Ariyan quests.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, there are these four Ariyan quests.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one,<br/>

    being in himself subject to <span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span> decay,<br/>

    seeing the disadvantage<br/>

    of what is of a nature to decay,<br/>

    seeks after the undecaying,<br/>

    the unsurpassed rest after toil,<br/>

    even Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being in himself subject to disease,<br/>

    seeing the disadvantage<br/>

    in what is of a nature to be diseased,<br/>

    he seeks after the unailing,<br/>

    unsurpassed rest after toil,<br/>

    even Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being in himself subject to death,<br/>

    seeing the disadvantage<br/>

    in what is of a nature to die,<br/>

    he seeks after the deathless,<br/>

    unsurpassed rest after toil,<br/>

    even Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being in himself subject to defilement,<br/>

    seeing the disadvantage<br/>

    in what is of a nature to be defiled,<br/>

    he seeks after the undefiled,<br/>

    unsurpassed rest after toil,<br/>

    even Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four Ariyan quests.'</p>
