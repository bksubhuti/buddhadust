    <h1>Māluṇkyā's Son<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now the venerable Māluṇkyā's son came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    saluted the Exalted One<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat thus<br/>

    the venerable Māluṇkyā's son said this<br/>

    to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One<br/>

    would teach me Dhamma in brief!</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing which Dhamma from the Exalted One's lips<br/>

    I could dwell alone,<br/>

    remote,<br/>

    earnest,<br/>

    ardent<br/>

    and resolute.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, Māluṇkyā's son,<br/>

    what am I to teach the young monks,<br/>

    when you,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    a broken-down old man,<br/>

    far-gone in years,<br/>

    beg a teaching in brief<br/>

    of the Tathāgata?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[254]</b></span> 'Nay, lord, let the Exalted One<br/>

    teach me Dhamma in brief!</p>

    <p class="f4">Surely I could understand the meaning<br/>

    of the Exalted One's words!</p>

    <p class="f4">Surely I could become heir<br/>

    to the Exalted One's words!'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, Māluṇkyā's son,<br/>

    there are these four ways<br/>

    in which craving arises in a monk<br/>

    when it does arise.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is because of the robe<br/>

    that craving arises in a monk when it does arise;<br/>

    it is because of alms-food,<br/>

    that craving arises in a monk when it does arise;<br/>

    it is because of lodging,<br/>

    that craving arises in a monk when it does arise;<br/>

    it is because of failure or success<br/>

    to become this or that<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    that craving arises in a monk when it does arise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Māluṇkyā's son,<br/>

    when craving is abandoned in a monk,<br/>

    cut down at the root,<br/>

    made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>

    made not to become again,<br/>

    made of a nature not to arise again in future time,<br/>

    this monk is called</p>

    <p class="f4">"One who has cut off craving,<br/>

    broken the bond,<br/>

    by perfect comprehension of conceit<br/>

    has made an end of Ill."'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Māluṇkyā's son,<br/>

    thus instructed by the Exalted One<br/>

    with this instruction,<br/>

    rose from his seat,<br/>

    saluted the Exalted One,<br/>

    and keeping his right side towards him<br/>

    went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Māluṇkyā's son,<br/>

    living solitary,<br/>

    remote,<br/>

    earnest,<br/>

    ardent<br/>

    and resolute,<br/>

    in that very life<br/>

    himself comprehending and realizing<br/>

    that unsurpassed perfection of the holy life,<br/>

    for which clansmen rightly go forth from the home<br/>

    to the homeless,<br/>

    having attained it<br/>

    abode therein,<br/>

    so that he fully comprehended the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">Cut off is rebirth,<br/>

    lived is the holy life,<br/>

    done the thing that should be done,<br/>

    there is no more of this state of things.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Māluṇkyā's son<br/>

    was yet another of the arahants.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
