    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Possessed of four qualities, monks,<br/>

    a rajah's noble, thoroughbred steed<br/>

    is worthy of the rajah,<br/>

    is the rajah's possession,<br/>

    is reckoned an asset of the rajah.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a rajah's noble, thoroughbred steed<br/>

    is possessed of beauty,<br/>

    strength,<br/>

    speed<br/>

    and good proportions.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br/>

    a rajah's noble, thoroughbred steed<br/>

    is worthy of the rajah,<br/>

    is the rajah's possession,<br/>

    is reckoned an asset of the rajah.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br/>

    possessed of four qualities<br/>

    a monk is worthy of offerings,<br/>

    worthy of hospitality,<br/>

    worthy of gifts,<br/>

    of salutations with clasped hands,<br/>

    a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a monk has beauty (of life),<br/>strength (of characteṃ,<br/>

    speed (of insight)<br/>

    and good proportions (of necessaries).</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of beauty?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a monk is virtuous,<br/>

    he lives restrained with the restraint of the obligations,<br/>

    is proficient in the practice of good conduct,<br/>

    seeing danger in the slightest faults<br/>

    he trains himself in the precepts<br/>

    by undertaking them.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way he has beauty (of life).</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of strength?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a monk lives ardent in energy,<br/>

    ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br/>

    to acquire good qualities,<br/>

    strenuously <span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span> exerting himself,<br/>

    not throwing off the burden in good qualities.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way he has strength (of character).</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of speed?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a monk understands,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ending of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice going to the ending of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way a monk is possessed of speed (of insight).</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of good proportions?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this case a monk is one<br/>

    who gets robe and alms-food,<br/>

    lodging,<br/>

    extras and necessary medicines<br/>

    for use in sickness.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way a monk is possessed of good proportions (of necessaries).</p>

    <p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br/>

    a monk is worthy of offerings,<br/>
