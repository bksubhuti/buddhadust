    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br/>

    the foolish,<br/>

    sinful,<br/>

    unworthy man<br/>

    carries about with him<br/>

    is blameworthy,<br/>

    is censured by the intelligent<br/>

    and begets much demerit.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Action of body that is blameworthy,<br/>

    action of speech that is blameworthy, <br/>
