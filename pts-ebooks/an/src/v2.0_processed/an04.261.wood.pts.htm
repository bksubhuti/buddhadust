    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, one possessing four qualities<br/>

    is put into purgatory<br/>

    according to his deserts.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">He himself takes life<br/>

    and encourages another to do so,<br/>

    approves of taking life<br/>

    and speaks in praise thereof.</p>

[Ed.: PTS text now uses only 'Vagga' for the title of this vagga. I have used the title of the vagga and the titles of the suttas as found in BJT and on the CSCD.]</p>
