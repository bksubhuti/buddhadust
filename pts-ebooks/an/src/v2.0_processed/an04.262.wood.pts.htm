    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, one possessing four qualities<br/>

    is put into purgatory<br/>

    according to his deserts.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">He himself steals<br/>

    and encourages another to steal,<br/>

    approves of stealing<br/>

    and speaks in praise of stealing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Possessing these four qualities<br/>

    one is put into purgatory<br/>

    encourages another to such abstinence<br/>

    approves of abstaining from stealing<br/>
