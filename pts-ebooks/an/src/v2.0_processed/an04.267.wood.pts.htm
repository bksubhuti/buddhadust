    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, one possessing four qualities<br/>

    is put into purgatory<br/>

    according to his deserts.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">He himself is a speaker of idle babble<br/>

    and encourages another in idle babble,<br/>

    approves of idle babble,<br/>

    and speaks in praise of idle babble.</p>
