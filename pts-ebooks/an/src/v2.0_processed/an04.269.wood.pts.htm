    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, one possessing four qualities<br/>

    is put into purgatory<br/>

    according to his deserts.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    and encourages another in malicious mindedness,<br/>

    approves of malicious mindedness,<br/>

    and speaks in praise of malicious mindedness.</p>
