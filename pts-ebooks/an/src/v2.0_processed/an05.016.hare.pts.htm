    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The power of faith,<br/>

    the power of energy,<br/>

    the power of mindfulness,<br/>

    the power of concentration<br/>

    and the power of insight.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, of these five learner's powers<br/>

    this is the chief,<br/>

    this is the binder,<br/>

    this is the tie,<br/>

    that to say:<br/>

    the power of insight.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, just as in a house with a peaked roof,<br/>

    this is the chief,<br/>

    this is the binder,<br/>

    this is the tie,<br/>

    that is to say:<br/>

    the peak;<br/>

    even so, monks,<br/>

    of these five powers<br/>

    this is the chief,<br/>

    this is the binder,<br/>

    this is the tie,<br/>

    that to say:<br/>

    the power of insight.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, train yourselves thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">We will become possessed of the power called the power of faith;<br/>

    we will become possessed of the power called the power of conscientiousness;<br/>

    we will become possessed of the power called the power of fear of blame;<br/>

    we will become possessed of the power called the power of energy;<br/>

    we will become possessed of the power called the power of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, monks.'</p>
