    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five things<br/>

    a monk is set on his own good,<br/>

    but not the good of another.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk is perfect in virtue himself,<br/>

    but does not strive to perfect virtue in another;<br/>

    he is perfect in concentration himself,<br/>

    but does not strive to perfect concentration in another;<br/>

    his own release<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> is perfected,<br/>

    but he does not strive that another's should be;<br/>

    his own vision<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> and knowledge of release are perfected,<br/>

    but he does not strive that another's should be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, possessed of these five things<br/>

    a monk is set on his own good,<br/>

    but not the good of another.'</p>
