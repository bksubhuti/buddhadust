    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five things<br/>

    a monk is set on the good of another,<br/>

    but not his own good.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk strives to perfect virtue in another<br/>

    but does not perfect virtue in himself;<br/>

    he strives to perfect concentration in another,<br/>

    but does perfect concentration in himself;<br/>

    he strives to perfect release in another,<br/>

    but he does not perfect release in himself;<br/>

    he strives to perfect vision and knowledge of release in another,<br/>

    but he does not perfect vision and knowledge of release in himself.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, possessed of these five things<br/>

    a monk is set on the good of another,<br/>

    but not his own good.</p>
