    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, that a disrespectful and unruly monk,<br/>

    not dwelling in harmony with his fellows in the godly life,<br/>

    will keep the minor precepts<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> -<br/>

    such a thing is not possible.</p>

    <p class="f4">That he will keep the learner's code<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    without keeping the minor precepts -<br/>

    such a thing is not possible.</p>

    <p class="f4">That he will keep the virtues<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    without keeping the learner's code -<br/>

    such a thing is not possible.</p>

    <p class="f4">That he will keep right views<br/>

    without keeping the virtues -<br/>

    such a thing is not possible.</p>

    <p class="f4">That he will keep right concentration<br/>

    without keeping right views -<br/>

    such a thing is not possible.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, that a monk,<br/>

    respectful and obedient,<br/>

    dwelling in harmony with his fellows in the godly life,<br/>

    will keep the minor precepts -<br/>

    such a thing shall surely be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That if he keep the minor precepts,<br/>

    he will keep the learner's code -<br/>

    such a thing shall surely be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That if he keep the learner's code,<br/>

    he will keep the virtues -<br/>

    such a thing shall surely be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That if he keep the virtues,<br/>

    he will keep right views -<br/>

    such a thing shall surely be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That if he keep right views,<br/>

    he will keep right concentration -<br/>

    such a thing shall surely be.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Abhisamācārikaṃ dhammaṃ.</i> <i>Comy.</i> the highest conduct in accord with the duties (<i>vatta,</i> <i>Ch.</i> 657), the declared morality. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Vism.</i> 11.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Sekhaṃ dhammaṃ.</i> <i>Comy.</i> <i>sekha-sīlaṃ,</i> for which see <i>G.S.</i> i, 199. At <i>Vism.</i> 12 <i>n.</i> 3 (also <i>trsl.</i>) this passage is said to be quoted, but there <i>'ādibrahmacariyaka'</i> replaces our <i>'sekha.'</i> See below VI, §§ 67-8.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Sīlāni.</i> <i>Comy.</i> the four great <i>'sīlas';</i> this seems to be a commentarial division; see Rhys Davids' note at <i>Q. of M.</i> ii, 57; moreover, the word <i>'mahāsīlāni'</i> does not seem to occur in the <i>Nikāyas,</i> though at <i>D.</i> i, 12 [<i>sic</i> pg 9] there is a subdivision called <i>'mahā-sīlaṃ,'</i> which is probably a late editorial addition. There is a fourfold division given at <i>Vism.</i> 11, also <i>J.</i> iii, 195; this is given at <i>Q. of M.</i> ii, 221, and is shown as being additional to the <i>sīlaṃ</i> of <i>D.</i> i, 4-12.</p>
