    <p><span class="f2">[25]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[17]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you how to make become<br/>

    the five-limbed<br/>

    Ariyan right concentration;<br/>

    listen attentively and pay heed and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord,' they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> take the case of a monk, who,<br/>

    aloof from sensuous appetites,<br/>

    aloof from evil ideas,<br/>

    enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>

    wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>

    which is born of solitude<br/>

    and is full of joy and ease;<br/>

    he steeps<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[18]</b></span> and drenches<br/>

    and fills<br/>

    and suffuses this body<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    with a zest and ease,<br/>

    born of solitude,<br/>

    so that there is not one particle<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> of the body<br/>

    that is not pervaded<br/>

    by this lone-born zest and ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, just as a handy bathman<br/>

    or attendant<br/>

    might strew bath-powder<br/>

    in some copper basin<br/>

    and, gradually sprinkling water,<br/>

    knead it together<br/>

    so that the bath-ball gathered up the moisture,<br/>

    became enveloped in moisture<br/>

    and saturated both in and out,<br/>

    but did not ooze moisture;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    even so a monk steeps,<br/>

    drenches,<br/>

    fills<br/>

    and suffuses this body<br/>

    with zest and ease,<br/>

    born of solitude,<br/>

    so that there is not one particle of the body<br/>

    that is not pervaded<br/>

    by this lone-born zest and ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is firstly how to make become<br/>

    the five-limbed Ariyan right concentration.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or a monk, suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>

    which is self-evolved,<br/>

    born of concentration,<br/>

    full of zest and ease,<br/>

    free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed;<br/>

    he steeps<br/>

    and drenches<br/>

    and fills<br/>

    and suffuses this body<br/>

    with joy and ease<br/>

    born of concentration,<br/>

    so that there is not one particle of the body<br/>

    that is not pervaded<br/>

    by this zest and ease<br/>

    born of concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, imagine a pool with a spring,<br/>

    but no water-inlet<br/>

    either on the east side<br/>

    or on the west<br/>

    or on the north<br/>

    or on the south,<br/>

    and suppose the (rain-) deva<br/>

    supply not proper rains from time to time —<br/>

    cool waters would still well up from that pool,<br/>

    and that pool would be<br/>

    steeped,<br/>

    drenched,<br/>

    filled<br/>

    and suffused<br/>

    with the cold water<br/>

    so that not a drop but would be pervaded<br/>

    by the cold water;<br/>

    in just the same way, monks,<br/>

    a monk steeps<br/>

    drenches,<br/>

    fills<br/>

    and suffuses<br/>

    his body with zest and ease<br/>

    born of concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is secondly how<br/>

    to make become the five-limbed Ariyan right concentration.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, a monk, free from the fervour of zest,<br/>

    mindful and self-possessed,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>

    and experiences in his being<br/>

    that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br/>

    'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease;<br/>. . .

    he steeps<br/>

    and drenches<br/>

    and fills<br/>

    and suffuses<br/>

    this body with a zestless ease<br/>

    so that there is not one particle of the body<br/>

    that is not pervaded by this zestless ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, just as in a pond of blue,<br/>

    white<br/>

    and red water-lilies,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    the plants are born in water,<br/>

    grow in water,<br/>

    come not <span class="f2 g"><b>[19]</b></span> out of the water,<br/>

    but, sunk in the depths,<br/>

    find nourishment,<br/>

    and from tip to root<br/>

    are steeped,<br/>

    drenched,<br/>

    filled<br/>

    and suffused<br/>

    with cold water<br/>

    so that not a part of them<br/>

    is not pervaded by cold water;<br/>

    even so, monks, a monk steeps<br/>

    and drenches<br/>

    and fills<br/>

    and suffuses<br/>

    his body in zestless ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is thirdly how to make become<br/>

    the five-limbed Ariyan right concentration.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, a monk, putting away ease<br/>

    and by putting away ill,<br/>

    by the passing away of happiness and misery<br/>

    he was wont to feel,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>

    which is utter purity of mindfulness,<br/>

    which comes of disinterestedness<br/>

    and is free of ease and ill;<br/>

    seated,<br/>

    he suffuses his body<br/>

    with purity by the pureness of his mind<br/>

    so that there is not one partide of the body<br/>

    that is not pervaded with purity<br/>

    by the pureness of his mind.</p>
