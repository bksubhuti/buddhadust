    <h1>On Getting Rich</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[37]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][olds][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    in Jeta Grove, at Anāthapiṇdika's Park;<br/>

    and there Anathapiṇḍika, the householder, came and visited him and,<br/>

    after saluting,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/>

    the Exalted One said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Householder, there are these five reasons for getting<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> rich.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Take<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the case of an Ariyan disciple<br/>

    with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br/>

    gathered by the strength of the arm,<br/>

    earned by the sweat of the brow,<br/>

    justly obtained in a lawful way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> —<br/>

    he makes himself happy,<br/>

    glad,<br/>

    and keeps that great happiness,<br/>

    he makes his parents happy,<br/>

    glad,<br/>

    and keeps them so;<br/>

    he makes his wife and children,<br/>

    glad,<br/>

    and keeps them so;<br/>

    he makes his slaves,<br/>

    glad,<br/>

    and keeps them so;<br/>

    he makes work-folk and men,<br/>

    glad,<br/>

    and keeps them so.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the first reason for getting rich.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br/>

    gathered by the strength of the arm,<br/>

    earned by the sweat of the brow,<br/>

    justly obtained in a lawful way,<br/>

    he makes his friends and companions happy,<br/>

    glad,<br/>

    and keeps them so.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the second reason for getting rich.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br/>

    gathered by the strength of the arm,<br/>

    earned by the sweat of the brow,<br/>

    justly obtained in a lawful way,<br/>

    ill-luck from fire and water,<br/>

    rajahs and robbers,<br/>

    enemies and heirs<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is warded off,<br/>

    and he keeps his goods in safety.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the third reason for getting rich.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br/>

    gathered by the strength of the arm,<br/>

    earned by the sweat of the brow,<br/>

    justly obtained in a lawful way,<br/>

    he makes the fiive oblations,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    that is to say:<br/>

    oblations to kin,<br/>

    guests,<br/>

    petas,<br/>

    rajahs<br/>

    and devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the fourth reason for getting rich.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span> Moreover, householder, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br/>

    gathered by the strength of the arm,<br/>

    earned by the sweat of the brow,<br/>

    justly obtained in a lawful way,<br/>

    the Ariyan diseiple institutes offerings,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    of lofty aim,<br/>

    celestial,<br/>

    ripening to happiness,<br/>

    leading heavenward,<br/>

    for all those recluses and godly men<br/>

    who abstain from pride and indolence,<br/>

    who bear all things in patience and humility,<br/>

    each mastering self,<br/>

    each calming self,<br/>

    eaeh perfecting self.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the fifth reason for getting rich.</p>

    <p class="f4">Householder, there are these five reasons for getting rich.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, if the wealth of that Ariyan disciple,<br/>

    heeding these five reasons,<br/>

    come to destruction,<br/>

    let him consider thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"At least, I've heeded<br/>

    those reasons for getting rich,<br/>

    but my wealth has gone!" —</p>

    <p class="f4">thus he is not upset.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And if his wealth increase,<br/>

    let him think:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Truly, I've heeded<br/>

    those reasons for getting rich,<br/>

    and my wealth has grown! —</p>

    <p class="f4">thus he is not upset in either case.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Bred,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> borne and battened is my household all<br/>

    Upon my wealth; I've warded off ill-luck;<br/>

    Made five oblations; furnished those good men.<br/>

    Who lead the godly life composed, with gifts<br/>

    And offerings of lofty aim; that meed,<br/>

    The wealth wise householders should seek, by me<br/>

    Is won — whate'er befall there's no regret!"</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Whoso considers thus, that man firm set<br/>

    In Ariyan Dhamma here on earth they praise.<br/>

    And afterwards in heaven he finds delight.</p>
