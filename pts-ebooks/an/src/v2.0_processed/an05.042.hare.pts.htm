    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> when a good man is born into a family<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of many folk;<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of his parents;<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of of of his wife and children;<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of his slaves, work-folk and men;<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of of his friends and companions;<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness<br/>

    of recluses and brahmans.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, just as good rains<br/>

    bring to perfection<br/>

    all crops<br/>

    for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of many folk;<br/>

    even so a <span class="f2 g"><b>[39]</b></span> good man is born into a family<br/>

    for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of many folk;<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of his parents;<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of of of his wife and children;<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of of his slaves, work-folk and men;<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness of of his friends and companions;<br/>

    it is for the good,<br/>

    welfare<br/>

    and happiness<br/>

    of recluses and brahmans.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">For many let the good man wealth pursue.<br/>

    Him Dhamma-warded doth a deva ward.<br/>

    For him well taught, moral and dutiful,<br/>

    Will honour never wane. On Dhamma standing,<br/>

    Virtuous, truth-speaking, conscientious,<br/>

    Of such a man who's fit to appraise the worth?<br/>

    'Tis even like red gold from Jambu's stream.<br/>

    Him devas praise, by Brahma praised is he.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
