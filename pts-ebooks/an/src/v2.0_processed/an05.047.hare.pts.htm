    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There are these five treasures, monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The treasure of faith,<br/>

    of virtue,<br/>

    of learning,<br/>

    of charity<br/>

    and of insight.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the treasure of faith?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has faith;<br/>

    he believes thus of the Tathāgata's awakening: -</p>

    <p class="f4">Of a truth he is the Exalted One,<br/>

    arahant,<br/>

    fully awakened,<br/>

    adept in knowledge and conduct,<br/>

    well going,<br/>

    a world-knower,<br/>

    incomparable,<br/>

    tamer of tamable men,<br/>

    among devas and men the teacher,<br/>

    Buddha,<br/>

    Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    the treasure of faith.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the treasure of virtue?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple abstains from taking life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>

    from taking what is not given,<br/>

    from carnal lusts,<br/>

    from lying,<br/>

    abstains from taking sloth-causing<br/>

    liquors,<br/>

    spirits,<br/>

    wines.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    the treasure of virtue.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the treasure of learning?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has learning<br/>

    and a memory, retentive and well stored<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn2" href="#edn2">ed2</a></sup></span><br/>

    and those things,<br/>

    lovely in the beginning,<br/>

    lovely in the middle,<br/>

    lovely in the end,<br/>

    which set forth in meaning and detail the godly life,<br/>

    wholly fulfilled,<br/>

    perfectly pure;<br/>

    all those are heard much by him,<br/>

    retained in mind,<br/>

    familiarized by talk,<br/>

    pored over,<br/>

    well penetrated by right view.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is<br/>

    the treasure of learning.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the treasure of charity?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple,<br/>

    living the householder's life,<br/>

    is free in heart<br/>

    from the stain of avarice;<br/>

    given over to charity,<br/>

    open-handed,<br/>

    delighting in making presents,<br/>

    he is <span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span> ready to comply with another's request<br/>

    and finds pleasure in almsgiving.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>

    the treasure of charity.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the treasure of insight?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has insight;<br/>

    he possesses insight<br/>

    into the way of growth and decay,<br/>

    and Ariyan penetration<br/>

    into the way<br/>

    to the utter destruction of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called the treasure of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are verily the five treasures.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Faith<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in the Tathāgata, unshaken, firm;<br/>

    Fair virtue, praised and loved by Ariyans;<br/>

    Serenity<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> in seeing upright men<br/>

    And in the Order — he whose way is thus,<br/>

    No beggar is he called, nor vain his life.<br/>

    Wherefore faith, virtue and serenity,<br/>

    Wise men, discerning Dhamma, e'er pursue,<br/>

    Remembering the message Buddhas bring.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> This <i>gātihā</i> recurs at <i>S.</i> i, 232; v, 384; <i>A.</i> ii, 67; <i>Th.</i> i, 506-9; for the last three lines of the text <i>Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> iv, 4.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare abbreviates here but there is not one case where he has translated the virtues in full. The missing lines (on taking what is not given, 'carnal lusts' and lying — <i>adinnādānā paṭivirato hoti, kāmesumicchācārā paṭivirato hoti, musā-vādā paṭivirato hoti</i>) are supplied from Volume III of the <i>G.S.,</i> translated by Woodward.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a></sup> Hare abbreviates here and in G.S. 7.6 translates differently. I have adapted his translation there to his translation here.</p>
