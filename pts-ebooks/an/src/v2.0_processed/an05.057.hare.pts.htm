    Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;<br/>

    When I perceive that men as plants increase,<br/>

    Cheered and check'd even by the self-same sky,<br/>

    Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<br/>

    And wear their brave state out of memory;<br/>

    Then the conceit of this inconstant stay<br/>

    Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<br/>

    Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,<br/>

    To change your day of youth to sullied night;<br/>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;And all in war with Time for love of you,<br/>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</p>
