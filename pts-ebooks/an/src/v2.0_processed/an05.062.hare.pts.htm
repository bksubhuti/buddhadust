    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these five thoughts,<br/>

    when made become,<br/>

    made an increase in,<br/>

    are very fruitful,<br/>

    of great advantage,<br/>

    merging in the deathless,<br/>

    having the deathless as their goal.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of impermanence;<br/>

    of not-self;<br/>

    of death;<br/>

    of the cloying of food;<br/>

    of distaste as to the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these five thoughts,<br/>

    when made become,<br/>

    made an increase in,<br/>

    are very fruitful,<br/>

    of great advantage,<br/>

    merging in the deathless,<br/>

    having the deathless as their goal.'</p>
