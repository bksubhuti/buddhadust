    <p><i>Psalms of the Brethren,</i> Introduction, page xxxiii: "Fourthly, the so-often reiterated record that the poems were first publicly uttered as 'confessions of <i>añña</i>' deserves  passing word. The history of this term, of its use and of its <i>non-</i>use, in Buddhism has yet to be written. Signifying literally <i>ad-sciens,</i> 'ac-knowledging,' añña is used in the Suttanta books to signify that mental flash, or suffusion of intuitive knowledge and assurance of 'salvation' contituting emancipation, or arahantship. The Buddha testifies to having realized it under the Bodhi-Thee, but uses the kindred, less specialized word <i>ñāṇa.</i> In the mouth of bhikkhus such testifying was no guarantee of right <i>(sammā)</i> gnosis; it might be made through mental illusion, conceit, frenzy, or even evil design (<i>Aṇguttara</i> iii., 119). Genuine, or <i>samma-d-aññā</i> is, of course, intended by the Commentary. This, in <i>Dhammapada,</i> verse 96, is rendered by Fausböll <i>absoluta gognitio;</i> by Max Müller, 'true knowledge.' That the testifying to it is as old as the Four Nikāyas, appears from the little episode in the <i>Aṇguttara Nikāya</i> iii. 359: - Two disciples who have newly realized this intuitive knowledge or gnosis, wait upon the Buddha and testify to the same before him. As hey again depart, the Buddha remarks: 'Even so do men of true breed declae gnosis <i>(aññā)</i>: - they tell of the good they have won <i>(attha),</i> but they do not bring in their ego <i>(attā).</i>' That the public individual testimony to the assurance of salvation won, invited yesterday and to-day in Christian revivalist meetings, should have been thus anticipated 2000 years ago in Buddhist usage, is an interesting link. And <i>aññā</i> is rarely attainment of such consciousness: - the 'fruition of arahantshp' <i>(arahattaphala).</i></p>
