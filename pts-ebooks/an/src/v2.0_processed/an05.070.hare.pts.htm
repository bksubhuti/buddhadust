    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these five things,<br/>

    when made become,<br/>

    made an ir crease in,<br/>

    lead to the destruction of the cankers.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk abides<br/>

    perceiving the foulness of the body;<br/>

    is conscious of the cloying of food;<br/>

    is conscious of distaste as to the world;<br/>

    perceives impermanence in all compounded things;<br/>

    and the thought of death is by him inwardly well established.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these five things,<br/>

    when made become,<br/>

    made an ir crease in,<br/>

    lead to the destruction of the cankers.</p>
