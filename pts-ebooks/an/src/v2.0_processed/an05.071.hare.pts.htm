    <h1>The Fruits of Mind-Emancipation (a)</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these five things,<br/>

    when made become,<br/>

    made an increase in,<br/>

    have as their fruits<br/>

    mind-emancipation<br/>

    and the advantages thereof,<br/>

    insight-emancipation<br/>

    and the advantages thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk abides<br/>

    perceiving the foulness of the body;<br/>

    is conscious of the cloying of food;<br/>

    is conscious of distaste as to the world;<br/>

    perceives impermanence in all compounded things;<br/>

    and the thought of death<br/>

    is by him inwardly well established.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these five things,<br/>

    when made become,<br/>

    made an increase in,<br/>

    have as their fruits<br/>

    mind-emancipation<br/>

    and the advantages thereof,<br/>

    insight-emancipation<br/>

    and the advantages thereof.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, when<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> indeed a monk is both<br/>

    mind-emancipated<br/>

    and insight-emancipated,<br/>

    that monk is said to have lifted the barrier,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    filled in the moat,<br/>

    pulled up the pillar,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    withdrawn the bolts,<br/>

    an Ariyan,<br/>

    with flag laid low,<br/>

    with burden dropped,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    free of the fetters.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks,<br/>

    has the monk lifted the barrier?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein by the monk<br/>

    ignorance is got rid of,<br/>

    cut down to the roots,<br/>

    made as a palm-tree stump,<br/>

    made so that it cannot grow up in the future,<br/>

    conditioned so that it cannot rise again.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, has the monk<br/>

    lifted the barrier.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, has the monk<br/>

    filled in the moat?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein <span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span> by the monk<br/>

    coming-to-be again,<br/>

    birth<br/>

    and faring on<br/>

    are got rid of,<br/>

    cut down to the roots,<br/>

    made as a palm-tree stump,<br/>

    made so that it cannot grow up in the future,<br/>

    conditioned so that it cannot rise again.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, has the monk<br/>

    filled in the moat.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, has the monk<br/>

    pulled up the pillar?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein by the monk<br/>

    craving is got rid of,<br/>

    cut down to the roots,<br/>

    made as a palm-tree stump,<br/>

    made so that it cannot grow up in the future,<br/>

    conditioned so that it cannot rise again.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, has the monk<br/>

    pulled up the pillar.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, has the monk<br/>

    withdrawn the bolts?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein by the monk<br/>

    the five lower fetters are got rid of,<br/>

    cut down to the roots,<br/>

    made as a palm-tree stump,<br/>

    made so that it cannot grow up in the future,<br/>

    conditioned so that it cannot rise again.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, has the monk<br/>

    withdrawn the bolts.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is the monk<br/>

    an Ariyan,<br/>

    with flag laid low,<br/>

    with burden dropped,<br/>

    free of the fetters?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, by the monk<br/>

    the conceit "I am" is got rid of,<br/>

    cut down to the roots,<br/>

    made as a palm-tree stump,<br/>

    made so that it cannot grow up in the future,<br/>

    conditioned so that it cannot rise again.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, is the monk an Ariyan,<br/>

    with flag laid low,<br/>

    with burden dropped,<br/>

    free of the fetters.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> explains with much exegetical matter by a simile: Imagine two cities, one a city of robbers, the other a city of peace; and suppose some mighty soldier were to think: 'So long as the robbers' city exists, the city of peace is not free from fear.' So he dons his armour and attacks and burns that city and returns to rejoice at home. The skandha group is the robbers' city, Nibbāna is the city of peace, an earnest striver is the mighty soldier.</p>
