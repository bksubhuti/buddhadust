    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a certain monk visited the Exalted One, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, they say:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Living by Dhamma, living by Dbamma!"</p>

    <p class="f4">Lord, how does a monk live by Dhamma?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Monk, consider the monk who masters Dhamma:</p>

    <p class="f4">the sayings,<br/>

    psalms,<br/>

    catechisms,<br/>

    songs,<br/>

    solemnities,<br/>

    speeches,<br/>

    birth-stories,<br/>

    marvels<br/>

    and runes -</p>

    <p class="f4">but knows not through insight the goal beyond.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to master,<br/>

    but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, consider the monk who teaches others Dhamma in detail,<br/>

    as he has heard it,<br/>

    as he has mastered it -<br/>

    he spends the day in convincing others of Dhamma;<br/>

    but knows not through insight the goal beyond.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to convince,<br/>

    but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, consider the monk who gives in full a repetition of Dhamma,<br/>

    as he has heard it,<br/>

    as he has learned it -<br/>

    he spends the day in repeating it;<br/>

    but knows not through insight the goal beyond..</p>

    <p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to repeat,<br/>

    but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then consider the monk who turns his mind to Dhamma,<br/>

    ponders over it,<br/>

    reflects on it,<br/>

    as he has heard it,<br/>

    as he has learned it -<br/>

    he spends his day in thinking about Dhamma;<br/>

    but knows not through insight the goal beyond.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to think,<br/>

    but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monk, take the case of the monk who masters Dhamma:</p>

    <p class="f4">the sayings,<br/>

    psalms,<br/>

    catechisms,<br/>

    songs,<br/>

    solemnities,<br/>

    speeches,<br/>

    birth-stories,<br/>

    marvels<br/>

    and runes -</p>

    <p class="f4">and spends not the day in that mastery,<br/>

    but knows through insight the goal beyond.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monk, such a monk is one who lives by Dhamma.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monk, thus, verily, have I declared one swift to master,<br/>

    one swift to convince,<br/>

    one swift to repeat,<br/>

    one swift to think<br/>

    and one who lives by Dhamma.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monk, what should be done by a teacher for his disciples,<br/>

    seeking their good,<br/>

    from compassion and out of pity,<br/>

    that has been done by me for you!</p>

    <p class="f4">(Behold) these tree-roots,<br/>

    tiese empty places, monk!</p>

    <p class="f4">Meditate, monk,<br/>

    and be not slothful;<br/>

    reproach not yourself afterwards!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is our command to you.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>
