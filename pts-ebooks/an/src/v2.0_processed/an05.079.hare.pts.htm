    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[84]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these five fears in the way,<br/>

    which have not yet arisen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for them;<br/>

    and, being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, there will be, in the long road of the future,<br/>

    monks who have not made body become,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become;<br/>

    and those who have not made body become,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become<br/>

    will cause the acceptance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of others,<br/>

    and verily they will not be able to lead them<br/>

    in the way of higher virtue,<br/>

    higher mind,<br/>

    higher insight:<br/>

    and they too will become monks<br/>

    who have not made body beeome,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become;<br/>

    and those who have not made body beeome,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become;<br/>

    will cause the acceptance of others,<br/>

    and verily they will not be able to lead them<br/>

    in the way of higher virtue,<br/>

    higher mind,<br/>

    higher insight:<br/>

    and they too will become monks<br/>

    who have not made body become,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus verily, monks,<br/>

    from corrupt Dhamma<br/>

    comes corrupt Discipline;<br/>

    from corrupt Discipline<br/>

    corrupt Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is the first fear in the way which,<br/>

    though not yet risen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>

    and being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks who have not made body beeome,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become;<br/>

    will give guidance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> to others,<br/>

    and verily they will not be able to lead them<br/>

    in the way of higher virtue,<br/>

    higher mind,<br/>

    higher in- <span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span> sight<br/>

    and those too who have not made body beeome,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become;<br/>

    will give guidance to others,<br/>

    and verily they will not be able to lead them<br/>

    in the way of higher virtue,<br/>

    higher mind,<br/>

    higher insight:<br/>

    and they too will become monks<br/>

    who have not made body become,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thua verily, monks,<br/>

    from corrupt Dhamma<br/>

    comes corrupt Discipline;<br/>

    from corrupt Discipline<br/>

    corrupt Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is the second fear in the way which,<br/>

    though not yet risen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>

    and being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks who have not made body beeome,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become;<br/>

    when giving a talk on more-Dhamma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    or on the runes,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    will not be fully awake (to the meaning),<br/>

    but will enter on a state of darkness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus verily, monks,<br/>

    from corrupt Dhamma<br/>

    comes corrupt Discipline;<br/>

    from corrupt Discipline<br/>

    corrupt Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is the third fear in the way which,<br/>

    though not yet risen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>

    and being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks who have not made body beeome,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become;<br/>

    will not listen,<br/>

    lend an ear,<br/>

    set up an understanding mind<br/>

    or deem such things should be grasped and mastered,<br/>

    when those sayings,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

    spoken by the Tathāgata,<br/>

    deep,<br/>

    deep in meaning,<br/>

    world-beyond,<br/>

    dealing with the void,<br/>

    are recited;<br/>

    but to the sayings of poets,<br/>

    mere poems,<br/>

    just a show of words and phrases,<br/>

    the works of outsiders,<br/>

    declaimed by their disciples —<br/>

    to such, when recited, they will listen,<br/>

    lend an ear,<br/>

    set up an understanding mind<br/>

    and deem such things should be grasped and mastered.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus indeed, monks,<br/>

    from corrupt Dhamma<br/>

    comes corrupt Discipline;<br/>

    from corrupt Discipline<br/>

    corrupt Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is the fourth fear in the way which,<br/>

    though not yet risen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>

    and being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks, there will be<br/>

    in the long road of the future<br/>

    monks who have not made body beeome,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become;<br/>

    and those elders who have not made body beeome,<br/>

    not made virtue become,<br/>

    not made mind become,<br/>

    not made insight become;<br/>

    will become luxurious,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    shirking <span class="f2 g"><b>[86]</b></span> the burden of the secluded life;<br/>

    and they will put forth no effort<br/>

    to attain the unattained,<br/>

    to master the unmastered,<br/>

    to realize the unrealized;<br/>

    and the folk who come after them<br/>

    will fall into the way of (wrong) views:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>

    and they too will become luxurious,<br/>

    lax,<br/>

    prime-movers in backsliding,<br/>

    to attain the unattained,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Thus indeed, monks,<br/>

    from corrupt Dhamma<br/>

    comes corrupt Discipline;<br/>

    corrupt Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is the fifth fear in the way which,<br/>

    <p>According to Rhys Davids <i>Buddhist India,</i> pg. 168. the term <i>'Suttanta'</i> means 'end of the suttas' in our sense of 'the aim' or 'a summary', that is, compiled from smaller suttas. Suttantas are mostly found in the Dīgha and Majjhima Nikāyas.</p>
