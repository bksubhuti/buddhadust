    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[86]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these five fears in the way,<br/>

    which have not yet arisen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for them;<br/>

    and, being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, there will be,<br/>

    in the long road of the future,<br/>

    monks who long for fine<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> robes;<br/>

    and they, with this longing,<br/>

    will leave the ways of wearing rags,<br/>

    will leave the forest wilderness,<br/>

    the out-land bed and seat;<br/>

    will move to village,<br/>

    town<br/>

    or rajah's capital<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    and make their dwelling there;<br/>

    and because of a robe,<br/>

    they will commit many things<br/>

    unseemly,<br/>

    unfit.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is the first fear in the way which,<br/>

    though not yet risen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>

    and being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, there will be,<br/>

    in the long road of the future,<br/>

    monks who will long for rich<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> alms-food;<br/>

    and they, with this longing,<br/>

    will leave the ways of the common round,<br/>

    the forest wilderness,<br/>

    the out-land bed and seat;<br/>

    will move to village,<br/>

    town<br/>

    or rajah's capital<br/>

    and make their dwelling there;<br/>

    seeking out, as it were<br/>

    with the tip of the tongue,<br/>

    tasty morsels;<br/>

    and because of alms-food,<br/>

    they will commit many things<br/>

    unseemly,<br/>

    unfit.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span> Monks, this is the second fear in the way which,<br/>

    though not yet risen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>

    and being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, there will be,<br/>

    in the long road of the future,<br/>

    monks who will long for a goodly bed and seat;<br/>

    and they, with this longing,<br/>

    will leave the ways of the tree-root abode,<br/>

    the forest wilderness,<br/>

    the out-land bed and seat;<br/>

    will move to village,<br/>

    town<br/>

    or rajah's capital<br/>

    and make their dwelling there;<br/>

    and because of a bed and seat,<br/>

    they will commit things<br/>

    unseemly,<br/>

    unfit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is the third fear in the way which,<br/>

    though not yet risen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>

    and being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, there will be,<br/>

    in the long road of the future,<br/>

    monks who will live in company<br/>

    with nuns<br/>

    and novices in training;<br/>

    and when this shall be,<br/>

    it may be expected<br/>

    that the monks will take no delight<br/>

    in leading the godly life;<br/>

    and either they will commit some foul act<br/>

    or give up the training<br/>

    and return to the lower life.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is the fourth fear in the way which,<br/>

    though not yet risen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>

    and being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks, there will be<br/>

    in the long road of the future<br/>

    monks who will live in company<br/>

    with the park folk<br/>

    and novices;<br/>

    and when this shall be,<br/>

    it may be expected<br/>

    that they will live and feast themselves<br/>

    on the plenty of hoarded stocks<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    and will mark out their lands and crops.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is the fifth fear in the way which,<br/>

    though not yet risen,<br/>

    will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for it;<br/>

    and being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the five fears in the way,<br/>

    which have not yet arisen,<br/>

    which will arise in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for them;<br/>

    and, being awake,<br/>

    strive to get rid of them.</p>
