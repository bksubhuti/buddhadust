    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if an elder monk be possessed of five qualities,<br/>

    among his fellows in the godly life<br/>

    he becomes neither dear<br/>

    nor pleasant<br/>

    nor respected<br/>

    nor what he ought to become.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">He is not free of passion,<br/>

    nor of corruption,<br/>

    nor of infatuation,<br/>

    and is full of cant<br/>

    and deceit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if he be possessed of these five qualities,<br/>

    among his fellows in the godly life<br/>

    he becomes neither dear<br/>
