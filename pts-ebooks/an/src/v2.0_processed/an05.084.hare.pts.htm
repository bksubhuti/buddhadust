    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if an elder monk be possessed of five qualities,<br/>

    among his fellows in the godly life<br/>

    he becomes neither dear<br/>

    nor pleasant<br/>

    nor what he ought to become.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">He is without faith,<br/>

    modesty,<br/>

    fear of blame,<br/>

    is lazy<br/>
