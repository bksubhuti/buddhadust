    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five qualities,<br/>

    the way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of an elder monk<br/>

    is not to the advantage of many folk,<br/>

    is not for the happiness of many folk,<br/>

    is not for the good of many folk;<br/>

    it is to the harm and ill of devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is the elder,<br/>
