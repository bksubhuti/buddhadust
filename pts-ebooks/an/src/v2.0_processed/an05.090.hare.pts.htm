    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these five conditions<br/>

    lead to the decline of a monk in training.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, take the case<br/>

    of a monk in training<br/>

    who is always busy<br/>

    and has much to do<br/>

    and is clever at work;<br/>

    he lets the time for going apart slip by,<br/>

    nor does he apply himself<br/>

    to calming the heart within.</p>

    of a monk in training<br/>

    in doing small things<br/>

    and lets the time for going apart slip by,<br/>

    nor does he apply himself<br/>

    to calming the heart within.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare has abridged this entire section with '(Just the opposite conditions' The text repeats in full' But whereas in the Pali the opposites are easily constructed by just applying 'na' to the previous, in English and especially in Hare's translation the opposites are not so easily formed. I have followed Hare as closely as possible, but some differences were impossible to avoid.</p>
