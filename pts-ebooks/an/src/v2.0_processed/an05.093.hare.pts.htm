    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    one <span class="f2 g"><b>[93]</b></span> filled with evil desires and longings;<br/>

    <p><i>Psalms of the Brethren,</i> Introduction, pg xxxiii: "... the so-often reiterated record that the poems were first publicly uttered as 'confessions of <i>aññā,</i>' deserves a passing word. The history of this term, of its use and of its <i>non-</i>use, in Buddhism has yet to be written. Signifying literally <i>ad-sciens,</i> 'ac-knowledging,' <i>aññā</i> is used in the Suttanta books to signify that mental flash, or suffusion of intuitive knowledge and assurance of 'salvation' constituting emancipation, or aarahantship. The Buddha testifies to having realized it under the Bodhi-Tree, but uses the kindred, less specialized word <i>ñāṇa.</i> In the mouth of bhikkhus such testifying was no guarantee of right <i>(sammā)</i> gnosis; it might be made through mental illusion, conceit, frenzy, or even evil design (<i>Aṇguttara</i> iii, 119). Genuine, or <i>samma-d-aññā</i> is, of course, intended by the Commentary. This, in Dhammapada, verse 96, is rendered by Fausböll <i>absoluta cognitio;</i> by Max Müller, 'true knowledge.' That the testifying to it is as old as the Four Nikāyas, appears from the little episode in the <i>Aṇguttara Nikāya,</i> iii. 359: - Two disciples who have newly realized this intuitive knowledge or gnosis, wait upon the Buddha and testify to the same before him. As they again depart, the Buddha remarks: 'Even so do men of true breed declare gnosis <i>(aññā);</i> - they tell of the good they have won <i>(attha),</i> but they do not bring in their ego <i>(attā).</i> [Footnote: The context shows that no derogatory judgment on confessions, such as these poems contain, is implied, but that only self-conceit and self-advertisement are condemned. Cf. ... vs 1076.] That the public individual testimony to the assurance of salvation won, invited yesterday and to-day in Christian revivalist meetings, should have been thus anticipated 2000 years ago in Buddhist usage, is an interesting link. And <i>aññā</i> is rarely met with except in connexion with the confession of the attainment of such consciousness: - the 'fruition of arahantship' <i>(arahattaphala).</i></p>
