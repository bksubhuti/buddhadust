    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five abodes of comfort.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk, aloof from sensuous appetites,<br/>

    aloof from evil ideas,<br/>

    enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>

    wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>

    which is born of solitude<br/>

    and is full of joy and ease.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>

    which is self-evolved,<br/>

    born of concentration,<br/>

    full of zest and ease,<br/>

    free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br/>

    mindful and self-possessed,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>

    and experiences in his being<br/>

    that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br/>

    'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting away ease<br/>

    and by putting away ill,<br/>

    by the passing away of happiness and misery<br/>

    he was wont to feel,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>

    which is utter purity of mindfulness,<br/>

    which comes of disinterestedness<br/>

    and is free of ease and ill.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">By the destruction of the cankers,<br/>

    he enters and abides in<br/>

    the realization of mind-emancipation<br/>

    and insight-emancipation,<br/>

    which is free of the cankers,<br/>

    fully comprehending those states himself,<br/>

    even in this world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the five abodes of comfort.'</p>
