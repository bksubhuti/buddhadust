    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five qualities a monk,<br/>

    practising awareness<br/>

    in breathing in and breathing out,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    will in no long time penetrate the immovable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span> He is set on little,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    busied in little,<br/>

    frugal,<br/>

    well content with life's necessities;<br/>

    taking food in little, he serves not his own belly;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    slothful in little, he is heedful in vigilance;<br/>

    he is learned,<br/>

    with a retentive and well-stored mind;<br/>

    those things, lovely in the beginning,<br/>

    lovely in the middle<br/>

    and lovely in the end,<br/>

    which set forth in spirit and letter<br/>

    the godly life of purity,<br/>

    perfect in its entirety<br/>

    — those are fully learnt by him,<br/>

    resolved upon,<br/>

    made familiar by speech,<br/>

    pondered over in mind,<br/>

    fully understood in theory;<br/>

    and he reflects on the mind as freed.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five qualities a monk,<br/>

    practising awareness<br/>

    in breathing in and breathing out,<br/>

    will in no long time penetrate the immovable.</p>
