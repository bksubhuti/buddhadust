    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of five qualities<br/>

    a monk, cultivating awareness<br/>

    in breathing in and breathing out,<br/>

    will in no long time penetrate the immovable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what five?</p>

    <p class="f4">He is set on little,<br/>

    busied in little,<br/>

    frugal,<br/>

    well content with life's necessities;<br/>

    </p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">taking food in little,<br/>

    he serves not his own belly;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">slothful in little,<br/>

    he is heedful in vigilance;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks, such talk as is austere<br/>

    and a help to opening the heart;<br/>

    talk on wanting little,<br/>

    on contentment,<br/>

    on loneliness,<br/>

    on not keeping company,<br/>

    on strenuous endeavour,<br/>

    on virtue,<br/>

    on concentration,<br/>

    on insight,<br/>

    on emancipation<br/>

    and on the knowledge and vision of emancipation —<br/>

    that he can obtain at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">and he reflects on the mind as freed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, possessed of these five qualities<br/>

    cultivating awareness<br/>

    in breathing in and breathing out,<br/>

    will in no long time penetrate the immovable.</p>
