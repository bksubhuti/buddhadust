    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, pursuing five courses<br/>

    a nun is surely cast into hell as a reward.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Without testing or plumbing the matter,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>

    she speaks in praise of the unpraiseworthy;<br/>

    without testing or plumbing the matter,<br/>

    she speaks in dispraise of the praiseworthy;<br/>

    she is jealous;<br/>

    she is mean;<br/>

    and she rejects the gift of faith.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, pursuing these five courses<br/>

    a nun is surely cast into hell as a reward.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, pursuing five courses<br/>

    a nun is surely set in heaven as a reward.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">After testing and plumbing the matter,<br/>

    she speaks in praise of the praiseworthy,<br/>

    after testing and plumbing the matter,<br/>

    she speaks in dispraise of the unpraiseworthy;<br/>

    she is not jealous;<br/>

    she is not mean;<br/>

    and she accepts the gift of faith.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, pursuing these five courses<br/>

    a nun is surely set in heaven as a reward.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare abridges this entire sutta with '...she is jealous, mean, and rejects the gift of faith' I have reconstructed the sutta using the previous sutta and the Pali.</p>
