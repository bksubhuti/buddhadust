    <b><i>Simple.</i></b> B.3. Originallly a medicine made from only one constituent, esp. from one plant.<br/>

    —O.E.D. Shorter</p>

    <p>What was considered medicine for the bhikkhus at the time was warm water, cow urine (amonia), honey and clarified butter. It is likely that any plant known to have medicinal properties would not have been allowed as its use would require injury of the plant. An exception could have been made for a medicine prepared from materials not harvested specifically for the bhikkhu.</p>
