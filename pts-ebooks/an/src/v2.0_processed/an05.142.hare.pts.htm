    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these five persons are found living in the world.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Ārabhati ca vippaṭisārī ca.</i> <i>Comy.</i> <i>āpatti-vītikkama-vasena ārabhati c'eva tappaccayā ca vippaṭisārī hoti. Ārabhati</i> is <i>lit.</i> to start (doing something); and <i>vippaṭisārī:</i> strongly remembering something against (oneself), so generally 'remorse.' <i>Cf.</i> <i>Pug.</i> 64.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> The text reads <i>ārabbhajā,</i> but <i>S.e.</i> with <i>v.l.</i> and <i>Comy.</i> <i>ārambhajā</i></p>

    <hr class="demi" />

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare's construction of these goes: "...the cankers, born of doing amiss, are discovered; born of dejection they wax...". This creates problems in the following sections which he has abridged with the indication that this pattern should be followed. I have altered his rendering to parallel the Pali.</p>
