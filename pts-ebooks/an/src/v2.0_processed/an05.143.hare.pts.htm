    <h1>At Sarandada Shrine</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, while he dwelt near Vesālī,<br/>

    at the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana,<br/>

    the Exalted One early one morning,<br/>

    after dressing,<br/>

    took bowl and robe<br/>

    and entered Vesālī for alms.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Nöw at that time<br/>

    about five hundred Licchavis were met<br/>

    and seated at Sārandada<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> shrine<br/>

    and this chance talk occurred:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Rarely are the five treasures<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely is the elephant treasure<br/>

    revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely the horse treasure<br/>

    revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely the the jewel treasure<br/>

    revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely the the woman treasure<br/>

    revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely the rarely the householder<br/>

    treasure revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely are these five treasures<br/>

    revealed in the world.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now these Licchavis had put a man in the road, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"When, my man, you see the Exalted One coming along,<br/>

    come and tell us."</p>

    <p class="f4">And the man saw the Exalted One<br/>

    a good way off coming along,<br/>

    and went and told the Licchavis, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sirs,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> here comes this same Exalted One,<br/>

    arahant,<br/>

    fully enlightened;<br/>

    and now's the time<br/>

    to do what you meant!"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Licchavis approached the Exalted One,<br/>

    saluted him<br/>

    and stood at one side;<br/>

    and so standing they said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, <span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span> it were good<br/>

    if the Exalted One were to visit Sārandada shrine<br/>

    out of compassion!'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One accepted in silence.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when he had come to the shrine,<br/>

    he sat down on the seat they had made ready;<br/>

    and so seated<br/>

    he said this to the Licchavis:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What talked ye of, 0 Licchavis,<br/>

    as ye sat here together just now;<br/>

    what talk between you was interrupted?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, as we sat together<br/>

    the talk turned on how rarely the five treasures<br/>

    are revealed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely is the elephant treasure<br/>

    revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely the horse treasure<br/>

    revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely the the jewel treasure<br/>

    revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely the the woman treasure<br/>

    revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely the rarely the householder<br/>

    treasure revealed in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rarely are these five treasures<br/>

    revealed in the world.'</p>
