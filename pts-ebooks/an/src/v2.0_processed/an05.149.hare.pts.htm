    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these five things<br/>

    lead to the falling away<br/>

    of a monk who is occasionally released.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    delight in company<br/>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these five things<br/>

    lead to the falling away<br/>

    of a monk who is occasionally released.</p>
