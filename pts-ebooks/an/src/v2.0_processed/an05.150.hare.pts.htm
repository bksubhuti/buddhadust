    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these five things<br/>

    lead to the falling away<br/>

    of a monk who is occasionally released.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Delight in (body) work,<br/>

    delight in gossip,<br/>

    delight in sleep,<br/>

    delight in unguarded doors of the senses,<br/>

    no moderation in eating.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these five things<br/>

    lead to the falling away<br/>

    of a monk who is occasionally released.</p>
