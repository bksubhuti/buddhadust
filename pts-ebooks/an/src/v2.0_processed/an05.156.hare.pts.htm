    <h1>The Confounding of Saddhamma (c)</h1>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[133]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these five things<br/>

    lead to the confounding,<br/>

    the disappearance of Saddhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the monks master an ill-grasped saying,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    ill-arranged as to word and letter;<br/>

    monks, when it is so ill-arranged,<br/>

    the meaning<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> also is an ill deduction.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the first thing<br/>

    that leads to the confounding,<br/>

    the disappearance of Saddhamma.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">They are speakers of ill,<br/>

    whose ways make for unruliness,<br/>

    without endurance,<br/>

    with little talent for grasping instruction.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the second thing<br/>

    that leads to the confounding,<br/>

    the disappearance of Saddhamma.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span> And the monks who have heard much,<br/>

    to whom the traditional lore<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> has come down,<br/>

    the Dhamma-bearers,<br/>

    the Discipline-bearers,<br/>

    the Summary-<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> bearers;<br/>

    they make not another say a saying carefully;<br/>

    and because of them<br/>

    the saying becomes like a thing with its roots<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> cut<br/>

    and no refuge.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the third thing<br/>

    that leads to the confounding,<br/>

    the disappearance of Saddhamma.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, the elders<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> are luxurious,<br/>

    lax,<br/>

    prime-movers in back-sliding,<br/>

    who shirk the burden of the secluded life,<br/>

    nor put forth effort<br/>

    to attain the unattained,<br/>

    to master the unmastered,<br/>

    to realize the unrealized;<br/>

    and the folk who come after them<br/>

    fall into the way of (wrong) views;<br/>

    and they too become luxurious,<br/>

    lax,<br/>

    prime-movers in backsliding,<br/>

    shirking the burden of the secluded life,<br/>

    putting forth no effort<br/>

    to attain the unattained,<br/>

    to master the unmastered,<br/>

    to realize the unrealized.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the fourth thing<br/>

    that leads to the confounding,<br/>

    the disappearance of Saddhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks, the Order<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> is broken;<br/>

    then there is reviling between one another,<br/>

    accusation between one another,<br/>

    quarrelling between one another,<br/>

    repudiation between one another;<br/>

    and they of no faith<br/>

    do not find faith there<br/>

    and the faithful<br/>

    become otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, the elders are not luxurious,<br/>

    or lax,<br/>

    are not prime-movers in back-sliding,<br/>

    do not shirk the burden of the secluded life,<br/>
