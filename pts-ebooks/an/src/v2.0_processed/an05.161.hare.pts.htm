    <h1>The Putting Away of Malice (a)</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][nymo]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">2. 'Monks, there are these five ways of putting away malice<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    whereby all malice arisen in a monk<br/>

    ought to be put away.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, in whatsoever person malice is engendered,<br/>

    in him amity ought to be made to become more.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>

    in him pity ought to be made to become more.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>

    in him poise ought to be made to become more.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>

    in that man<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> unmindfulness,<br/>

    inattention to it,<br/>

    ought to be brought about.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way malice in him ought to be put away.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, in whomsoever malice is engendered,<br/>

    in that man the fact that he is of his own making<br/>

    ought to be fixed in his mind;<br/>

    and he should think:</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>Bhk. Thanissaro has made better sense of this:<br/>

    'This venerable one<br/>

    is the doer of his kamma,<br/>

    heir of his kamma,<br/>

    born of his kamma,<br/>

    related by his kamma,<br/>

    and is dependent on his kamma.<br/>

    Whatever kamma he does,<br/>

    for good or for evil,<br/>

    to that will he fall heir.'</p>
