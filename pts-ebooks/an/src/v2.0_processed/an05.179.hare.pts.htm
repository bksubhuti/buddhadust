    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the householder Anāthapiṇḍika,<br/>

    surrounded by about five hundred lay-disoiples,<br/>

    visited the Exalted One and,<br/>

    after saluting,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the venerable Sāriputta<br/>

    and said;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sāriputta, any white-frooked home-man<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> you know,<br/>

    who acts controlled<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    in the five steps of the training<br/>

    and obtains at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty<br/>

    the four<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> very purposive abodes of ease,<br/>

    here amid things seen,<br/>

    declare just the (state of) self<br/>

    by the self,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed' is hell for me;<br/>

    destroyed is animal-rebirth;<br/>

    destroyed is the realm of ghosts;<br/>

    destroyed for me is the wayward way,<br/>

    the ill way,<br/>

    the abyss;<br/>

    I am he who has won to the Stream,<br/>

    not subjeot to any falling away,<br/>

    <p class="f4">He acts controlled<br/>

    in what five steps of the training?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Sāriputta, the Ariyan disciple<br/>

    abstains from taking life,<br/>

    from taking what is not given,<br/>

    from fleshly lusts,<br/>

    from lying<br/>

    and from drinking spirituous liquors<br/>

    that cause indolence.</p>

    <p class="f4">He acts controlled<br/>

    in these five steps of the training.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four abodes of ease,<br/>

    very purposive,<br/>

    he obtains at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty<br/>

    here amid things seen?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Sāriputta, the Ariyan disciple<br/>

    has unwavering faith in the Buddha:</p>

    <p class="f4">Of a truth he is that,<br/>

    the Exalted One,<br/>

    arahant,<br/>

    fully enlightened,<br/>

    walking in knowledge,<br/>

    well gone,<br/>

    wise in the ways of the worlds,<br/>

    with none greater,<br/>

    tamer of tamable men,<br/>

    teacher of devas and men,<br/>

    Buddha,<br/>

    lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the first<br/>

    very purposive abode of ease,<br/>

    won, here amid things seen,<br/>

    by purifying impure thought,<br/>

    by cleansing unclean thought.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Sāriputta, the Ariyan disciple<br/>

    has unwavering faith in Dhamma;</p>

    <p class="f4">Well declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma,<br/>

    one to be seen here and now,<br/>

    not for other times,<br/>

    bidding one <span class="f2 g"><b>[156]</b></span> come and see,<br/>

    a guide to be understood by wise men,<br/>

    each for himself.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the second<br/>

    won, here amid things seen,<br/>

    by purifying impure thought,<br/>

    by cleansing unclean thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">He has unwavering faith in the Order;</p>

    <p class="f4">Well trained<br/>

    is the Exalted One's Order of disciples;<br/>

    trained in uprightness<br/>

    is the Exalted One's Oder of disciples;<br/>

    trained in method<br/>

    is the Exalted One's Order of disciples;<br/>

    trained in the way of right<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    is the Exalted One's Order of disciples —<br/>

    the four pairs of men,<br/>

    the eight male persons —<br/>

    this is the Exalted One's Order of disciples,<br/>

    worthy of offerings,<br/>

    worthy of oblations,<br/>

    worthy of gifts,<br/>

    meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>

    a field for merit,<br/>

    none greater in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the third<br/>

    very purposive abode of ease,<br/>

    won, here amid things seen,<br/>

    by purifying impure thought,<br/>

    by cleansing unclean thought.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, Sāriputta, the Ariyan disciple<br/>

    is possessed of virtues<br/>

    beloved by Ariyans —<br/>

    whole,<br/>

    unbroken,<br/>

    untarnished,<br/>

    without blemish,<br/>

    bringing freedom,<br/>

    praised by wise men,<br/>

    incorrupt,<br/>

    conducive to concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the fourth<br/>

    very purposive abode of ease,<br/>

    won, here amid things seen,<br/>

    by purifying impure thought,<br/>

    by cleansing unclean thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four abodes of ease,<br/>

    very purposive,<br/>

    he obtains at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty<br/>

    here amid things seen</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Sāriputta, any white-frocked home-man you know,<br/>

    who acts controlled<br/>

    in these five steps of the training<br/>

    and obtains at will,<br/>

    these four very purposive abodes of ease,<br/>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Seeing hell's fearfulness, shun wickedness;<br/>

    Wise men shun that, firm set in Ariyan Dhamma.<br/>

    Not harming aught that breathes where progress is;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    Lie not, nor knowingly touch things ungiven;<br/>

    live gladly with thine own, leave<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> others' wives;<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[157]</b></span> No man should drink strong drink<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> that dulls the thought;<br/>

    With gift in Dhamma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> furnished, that gift,<br/>

    First giv'n to godly men, will richly ripen.<br/>

    Is found the well-tamed ox, strong beast of burden,<br/>

    The load and yoke whate'er his hue may be;<br/>

    So among men of noble, brahman, low,<br/>

    Or serf breeds, outcasts, aboriginals,<br/>

    Is found the well-tamed, pious, modest man,<br/>

    Just,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> virtuous, truth-speaking, done with birth<br/>

    And death, accomplished in the godly life,<br/>

    With load put down, done what was to be done.<br/>

    Rid of the cankers, yea and gone beyond<br/>

    All states, not clinging, cool — lo! in that field<br/>

    Of faultless men a gift will richly ripen.<br/>

    The witless, loreless<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> fools, all-ignorant,<br/>

    Give gifts outside that field nor serve good men.<br/>

    But they, with faith firm rooted in the Well-gone,<br/>

    Who serve the good—wise men and by wise men<br/>

    Held wise<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> — go to the deva-realm, or here<br/>

    Are born within some clan;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> and as wise men<br/>

    In gradual course attain Nibbāna's bliss.'</p>
