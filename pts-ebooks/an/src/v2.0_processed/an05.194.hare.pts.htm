    <h1>Brāhman Kāraṇapālin</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once dwelling near Vesālī,<br/>

    at the Gabled Hall,<br/>

    in Mahāvana.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time brāhman Karaṇapālin<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    built a building for the Licchavis.</p>

    <p class="f4">And brāhman <span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span> Kāraṇapālin<br/>

    saw brāhman Piṇgiyānin<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> some way off,<br/>

    coming along;<br/>

    and on seeing him (approach), he said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Pray<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> now,<br/>

    whence comes his honour Piṇgiyānin<br/>

    so early in the day?</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am come here, sir,<br/>

    from the presence of the recluse Gotama.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, what thinks his honour Piṇgiyānin<br/>

    of the recluse Gotama's clarity in wisdom;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    does he think him a wise man?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'But who am I [to him], sir;<br/>

    and who am I to judge of his clarity?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is it not one who is like him<br/>

    that can alone judge<br/>

    the recluse Gotama's clarity in wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lofty indeed is the praise<br/>

    with which his honour Piṇgiyānin<br/>

    praises the recluse Gotama.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'But who am I [to him], sir;<br/>

    and who am I to praise the recluse Gotama?</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, praised by the praised<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    is his honour Gotama,<br/>

    chief among devas and men.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'But what good thing<br/>

    does his honour Piṇgiyānin see<br/>

    to have so great faith in the recluse Gotama?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Just,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> sir, as a man,<br/>

    well satisfied with some choice savour,<br/>

    longs not for other savours that are mean;<br/>

    even so, sir, whenever one hears his honour Gotama's Dhamma,<br/>

    whether in the sayings,<br/>

    the psalms,<br/>

    the catechisms<br/>

    or the marvels —<br/>

    none longs for the talks of others:<br/>

    the many-folk,<br/>

    recluses<br/>

    or brāhmans.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[173]</b></span> Just,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> sir, as a man,<br/>

    overcome by hunger and weakness,<br/>

    may come upon a honey cake and,<br/>

    whenever he taste,<br/>

    enjoy the sweet, delicious savour;<br/>

    even so, sir, whenever one hears his honour Gotama's Dhamma,<br/>

    whether in the sayings,<br/>

    psalms,<br/>

    catechisms<br/>

    or marvels —<br/>

    he wins elation,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    wins serenity of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just, sir, as a man may come upon a stick of sandalwood,<br/>

    yellow or red, and,<br/>

    wherever he smell,<br/>

    at the root,<br/>

    in the middle,<br/>

    at the top —<br/>

    may come upon an exceeding fair,<br/>

    delicious smell:<br/>

    even so, sir, whenever one hears his honour Gotama's Dhamma,<br/>

    whether in the sayings,<br/>

    psalms,<br/>

    catechisms<br/>

    or marvels —<br/>

    he finds joy,<br/>

    finds happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> sir, as a clever physician<br/>

    might in a trice<br/>

    take away the sickness<br/>

    of one sick and ailing,<br/>

    grievously ill;<br/>

    even so, sir, whenever one hears his honour Gotama's Dhamma,<br/>

    whether in the sayings,<br/>

    psalms,<br/>

    catechisms<br/>

    or marvels —<br/>

    grief,<br/>

    lamentation,<br/>

    suffering,<br/>

    sorrow<br/>

    and despair<br/>

    vanish away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just,<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> sir, as a man,<br/>

    tortured by heat,<br/>

    by heat forspent,<br/>

    wearied,<br/>

    craving<br/>

    and thirsty,<br/>

    might come to a pool,<br/>

    clear,<br/>

    sweet,<br/>

    cool,<br/>

    limpid,<br/>

    a lovely resting-place,<br/>

    and might plunge therein,<br/>

    bathe and drink,<br/>

    and allay all woe,<br/>

    fatigue<br/>

    and fret;<br/>

    even so, sir, whenever one hears his honour Gotama's Dhamma,<br/>

    whether in the sayings,<br/>

    psalms,<br/>

    catechisms<br/>

    or marvels —<br/>

    all woe,<br/>

    fatigue<br/>

    and fret<br/>

    is wholly allayed.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken,<br/>

    brāhman Karaṇapalin arose from his seat,<br/>

    arranged his upper robe on his shoulder,<br/>

    set his right knee on the ground,<br/>

    and, bending forth his outstretched hands<br/>

    towards the Exalted One,<br/>

    three times uttered this utterance:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'Honour to him, the Exalted One, arahant, fully enlightened.</p>

    <p class="f4">Honour to him, the Exalted One, arahant, fully enlightened.</p>

    <p class="f4">Honour to Mm, the Exalted One, arahant, fully enlightened.'</p>

    <p class="f4">(Then said he:)</p>

    <p class="f4">'Wonderful is it, Master Piṇgiyānin, <span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span><br/>

    wonderful is it, Master Piṇgiyānin!|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'Tis just as if one had set upright a thing toppled over,<br/>

    opened out a covered thing,<br/>

    showed a blind man along the road,<br/>

    brought an oil lamp into the dark,<br/>

    so that those that had eyes could see objects —<br/>

    it is just thus that Dhamma has been blazed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> abroad by his honour Piṇgiyānin in manifold ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, too,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> Master Piṇgiyānin,<br/>

    go to that exalted Gotama for refuge,<br/>

    to Dhamma<br/>

    and to the monk-Order;<br/>

    let his honour Piṇgiyānin look upon me as a lay-disciple,<br/>

    to that refuge gone,<br/>

    henceforth as long as life lasts!'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> I cannot find mention of this brāhman elsewhere; <i>Comy.</i> observes that he built buildings for rajahs' families; getting up early, he was having the unfinished walls of a gateway built; he (also) looked after the feeding of the aged. The text reads <i>'Licchavīnaṃ kammantaṃ kāreti';</i> according to Childers (quoting Senart's <i>Kaccāyanappakaraṇaṃ</i>) <i>kāreti</i> with acc. and gen. means: he causes someone (gen.) to do something (acc.); see his <i>Dict. s.v.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Nor cam I trace this brāhman elsewhere except in the next sutta; <i>Comy.</i> observes that he was established in the fruit of a Non-returner.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> All this to the similes recurs at <i>M.</i> i, 175; ii, 208 of others. The br. K. addresses br. P. by <i>bhavaṃ</i> and after conversion by <i>bho,</i> speaking of the B. as <i>samana</i> firstly, latterly as <i>bhavantaṃ</i> (so <i>S.e.</i> but <i>v.l.</i> <i>bhagavantaṃ</i>); br. P. addresses br. K. by <i>bho,</i> speaking of the B. as <i>samaṇa</i> and <i>bhavaṃ.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Paññāveyyattiya.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Our text, <i>S.e.</i> and <i>M.</i> ii <i>maññe-ti,</i> but <i>M.</i> i and our <i>Comy.</i> <i>maññati,</i> explaining: <i>'bhavaṃ P. samaṇaṃ Gotamaṃ paṇḍito ti maññati, udāhu no?'</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Pasattha-pasattho.</i> Lord Chalmers: 'praise upon praise is his,' but our <i>Comy.</i> instances, among others, Pasenadi, Bimbisāra, Cankī, Visākhā, Sakka, Brahmā, observing: <i>pasatthehi va pasattho-ti pi, pasatthapasattho.</i></p>
