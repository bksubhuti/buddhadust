    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> when the Exalted One was staying in the Bamboo Grove<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> near Kimbila,<br/>

    the venerable Kimbila visited him and,<br/>

    after saluting,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, what is the cause,<br/>

    what is the reason,<br/>

    whereby, when the Exalted One has passed away completely,<br/>

    Saddhamma does not become long-lasting?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Suppose, Kimbila, after the Tathāgata has passed away completely,<br/>

    the monks and the nuns,<br/>

    the lay-dipciples both men and women,<br/>

    live without<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> reverence,<br/>

    without heed <span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span> for the Teacher;<br/>

    without reverence, without heed for Dhamma<br/>

    without reverence, without heed for the Order.<br/>

    without reverence, without heed for the training;<br/>

    without reverence, without heed for one another -<br/>

    this is the cause,<br/>

    this is the reason,<br/>

    whereby, when the Tathāgata has passed away completely,<br/>

    Saddhamma does not become long-lasting.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">'And what, lord, is the cause,<br/>

    the reason,<br/>

    whereby, after the Tathāgata has passed away,<br/>

    Saddhamma becomes long-lasting?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Suppose, Kimbila, monks, nuns<br/>

    and lay-disciples<br/>

    revere and give heed to the Teacher,<br/>

    revere and give heed to the Dhamma,<br/>

    revere and give heed to the training;<br/>
