    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five forms of mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, suppose a monk has doubts and is perplexed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> about the Teacher,<br/>

    is not certain nor sure in him;<br/>

    monks, whoso thus doubts and is perplexed about the Teacher,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the first form of mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, suppose a monk has doubts and is perplexed about Dhamma,<br/>

    is not certain nor sure in it;<br/>

    monks, whoso thus doubts and is perplexed about the Dhamma,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the second form of mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, suppose a monk has doubts and is perplexed about the Order,<br/>

    is not certain nor sure in it;<br/>

    monks, whoso thus doubts and is perplexed about the Order,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the third form of mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, suppose a monk has doubts and is perplexed about the training,<br/>

    is not certain nor sure in it;<br/>

    monks, whoso thus doubts and is perplexed about the training,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the fourth form of mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, suppose a monk becomes angry with his fellows in the godly life,<br/>

    displeased with them,<br/>

    upset about them,<br/>

    becomes as a barren Waste for them;<br/>

    monks, whoso becomes angry with his fellows in the godly life,<br/>

    displeased with them,<br/>

    upset about them,<br/>

    becomes as a barren Waste for them<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the fifth form of mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five forms of mental barrenness.'</p>
