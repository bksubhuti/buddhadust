    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five disadvantages to the visitor of families.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span> In going uninvited he offends;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    by sitting in solitude he offends;<br/>

    in using an obscure seat he offends;<br/>

    in teaching Dhamma to women<br/>

    in more than five or six words he offends;<br/>

    he lives engrossed in thoughts of lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the five disadvantages to the visitor of families.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Anāmanta-cāra.</i> <i>Comy.</i> observes that on being invited to a meal, from not asking a good monk, he calls on families either before the meal or after — so in respect of the training, it is said he commits a fault. At <i>Vin.</i> i, 255 this word recurs with the fault <i>a-samādāna-cāra,</i> going for alms without taking all one's robes; possibly Bu. has made an ecclesiastical offence of it, when it really means the family visited is offended, as must be in the second and third clauses.</p>
