    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk in residence<br/>

    follow the course of five things,<br/>

    as his reward he is surely cast into hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">He is stingy as to praise;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he is stingy over (sharing) his lodging;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he is stingy as to the family (who provides);</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he is stingy as to gains;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">and he frustrates the gift of faith.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk in residence<br/>

    follow the course of these five things,<br/>
