    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī; and there he addressed the monks, saying: 'Monks.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are five disadvantages to one who has walked in evil in thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The self upbraids the self;<br/>

    from knowledge the wise dispraise him;<br/>

    an evil rumour of his worth goes abroad;<br/>

    he dies muddied in thought;<br/>

    on the breakingup of the body after death<br/>

    he arises in the wayward way,<br/>

    the ill way,<br/>

    the abyss,<br/>

    hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five disadvantages<br/>

    to one who has walked in evil in thought.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are five advantages to one who has walked in good in thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">The self does not upbraid the self;<br/>

    from knowledge the wise praise him;<br/>

    an good rumour of his worth goes abroad;<br/>

    he dies unmuddied in thought;<br/>

    on the breaking up of the body after death<br/>

    he arises in heaven,<br/>

    that happy place of bliss.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five advantages to one who has walked in good in thought.'</p>
