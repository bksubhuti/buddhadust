    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī; and there he addressed the monks, saying: 'Monks.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are five disadvantages to one who has walked in evil in deed.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The self upbraids the self;<br/>

    from knowledge the wise dispraise him;<br/>

    an evil rumour of his worth goes abroad;<br/>

    he turns from Saddhamma;<br/>

    he is not set in Saddhamma.</p>

    to one who has walked in evil in deed.'</p>
