    <h1>The Cemetery</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[195]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five disadvantages in a cemetery.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is unclean,<br/>

    evil-smelling,<br/>

    fearful,<br/>

    the haunt of bestial non-humans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    and is the cause of many folk wailing.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the five disadvantages in a cemetery.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, monks, there are these five disadvantages<br/>

    in a cemetery-like person.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Consider, monks, some person<br/>

    who follows the course of unclean action in deed,<br/>

    who follows the course of unclean action in word<br/>

    who follows the course of unclean action in thought —<br/>

    I declare this to be his uncleanness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is unclean,<br/>

    thus-like I declare this person to be.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span> Whoso follows the course of unclean action in deed,<br/>

    whoso follows the course of unclean action in word<br/>

    whoso follows the course of unclean action in thought,<br/>

    an evil rumour of his worth goes about —<br/>

    I declare this to be his evil smell.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is evil-smelling,<br/>

    thus-like I declare this person to be.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">At once his course is of unclean action in deed,<br/>

    of unclean action in word<br/>

    of unclean action in thought,<br/>

    his pious<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> fellows in the godly life<br/>

    turn themselves from him<br/>

    and keep far away —<br/>

    I declare this to be his fearfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is fearful,<br/>

    thus-like I declare this person to be.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">As he follows that course of unclean action in deed,<br/>

    that course of unclean action in word<br/>

    that course of unclean action in thought,<br/>

    he lives with others,<br/>

    sharing their ways —<br/>

    I declare this to be his bestial haunting.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is the haunt of bestial non-humans,<br/>

    thus-like I declare this person to be.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Seeing him thus following this course of unclean action in deed,<br/>

    this course of unclean action in word<br/>

    this course of unclean action in thought,<br/>

    <br/>

    his pious fellows in the godly life become vexed<br/>

    and say:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Alas! this is an ill thing for us,<br/>

    who have to live with such a person!"</p>

    <p class="f4">I declare this to be his making others wail.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is the cause of many folk wailing,<br/>

    thus-like I declare this person to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, there are these five disadvantages in a cemetery-like person.'</p>
