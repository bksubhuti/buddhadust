    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five disadvantages<br/>

    of devotion to one person.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, when a person<br/>

    becomes very devoted to a person<br/>

    and that person falls into an error<br/>

    such that the Order suspend him,<br/>

    then he will think:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Order has suspended<br/>

    him who is dear and lovely to me!"</p>

    <p class="f4">And he will be no more<br/>

    full of devotion for the monks,<br/>

    and from being without that devotion<br/>

    he will not follow other monks,<br/>

    and from not following other monks<br/>

    he will not hear Saddhamma,<br/>

    and from not hearing Saddhamma<br/>

    he will fall away from Saddhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the first disadvantage<br/>

    of devotion to one person.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or that person falls into an error<br/>

    such that the Order make him sit on the outskirts (of a gathering),<br/>

    then he will think:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Order has made<br/>

    him who is dear and lovely to me<br/>

    sit on the outskirts!"</p>

    <p class="f4">And he will be no more<br/>

    full of devotion for the monks,<br/>

    and from being without that devotion<br/>

    he will not follow other monks,<br/>

    and from not following other monks<br/>

    he will not hear Saddhamma,<br/>

    and from not hearing Saddhamma<br/>

    he will fall away from Saddhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the second disadvantage<br/>

    of devotion to one person.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span> Or when a person<br/>

    he who was dear and lovely to me!"</p>

    becomes very devoted to a person<br/>

    and that person wanders<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> (in mind),<br/>

    then he will think:</p>

    <p class="f4">"He wanders,<br/>

    he who was dear and lovely to me!"</p>

    <p class="f4">And he will not follow other monks,<br/>

    and from not following other monks<br/>

    he will not hear Saddhamma,<br/>

    and from not hearing Saddhamma<br/>

    he will fall away from Saddhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the fourth disadvantage<br/>

    of devotion to one person.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or when a person<br/>

    becomes very devoted to a person<br/>

    and that person dies,<br/>

    then he will think:</p>

    <p class="f4">"He is dead,<br/>

    he who was dear and lovely to me!"</p>

    <p class="f4">And he will not follow other monks,<br/>

    and from not following other monks<br/>

    he will not hear Saddhamma,<br/>

    of devotion to one person.'</p>
