    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if one abandon not these five things,<br/>

    one cannot realize the fruit of Non-returning.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Stinginess as to one's lodging,<br/>

    stinginess as to family,<br/>

    stinginess as to gains,<br/>

    stinginess as to fame,<br/>

    stinginess as to Dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, if one abandon not these five things,<br/>

    one cannot realize the fruit of Non-returning."</p>
