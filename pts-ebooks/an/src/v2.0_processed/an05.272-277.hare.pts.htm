    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare has misnumbered this section. There is no #277. I have retained the numbering to eliminate possible confusion with references. Bhk. Bodhi has this whole section as one sutta, #272 which is probably the way it was originally intended. The Sutta numbering from here will not agree with the Wisdom Publications edition to the end of the Fives. The Index indicates the corresponding suttas.</p>
