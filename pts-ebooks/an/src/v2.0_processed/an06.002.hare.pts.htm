    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, a monk who follows six things is worthy of offerings,<br/>

    worthy of gifts,<br/>

    worthy of oblations,<br/>

    meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk experiences psychic power in manifold <span class="f2 g"><b>[203]</b></span> modes -</p>

    <p class="f4">Being one,<br/>

    being many,<br/>

    he becomes one;<br/>

    he becomes visible or invisible;<br/>

    goes without let<br/>

    through walls,<br/>

    through fences,<br/>

    through mountains,<br/>

    as if they were but air;<br/>

    he dives in and out of the earth,<br/>

    as if it were but water;<br/>

    he walks on water<br/>

    without parting it,<br/>

    as if it were earth;<br/>

    he travels cross-legged through the air,<br/>

    as a bird on the wing;<br/>

    he handles and strokes the moon and the sun,<br/>

    though they be so powerful and strong;<br/>

    he scales the heights of the world<br/>

    even in this body -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">With the celestial means of hearing,<br/>

    purified and surpassing that of men,<br/>

    he hears sounds<br/>

    such my experience of happiness and ill,<br/>

    such my span of life;<br/>

    faring on thence<br/>
