    <h1>On Being Considerate (b)</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are six ways of being considerate, which endear,<br/>

    bring honour,<br/>

    lead to concord,<br/>

    banish contention,<br/>

    lead to unity,<br/>

    lead to singleness of heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk's part is amity in deed<br/>

    towards his fellows in the godly life,<br/>

    openly and in private;<br/>

    verily, this is a way of being considerate,<br/>

    which endears,<br/>

    brings honour,<br/>

    leads to concord,<br/>

    banishes contention,<br/>

    leads to unity,<br/>

    leads to singleness of heart.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, his part is amity in word,<br/>

    towards his fellows in the godly life,<br/>

    openly and in private;<br/>

    verily, this also is a way of being considerate,<br/>

    which endears,<br/>

    brings honour,<br/>

    leads to concord,<br/>

    banishes contention,<br/>

    leads to unity,<br/>

    leads to singleness of heart.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, those proper gains,<br/>

    gotten according to rule -<br/>

    be they but böwl-scraps -<br/>

    he loves to share them impartially,<br/>

    to have them in common<br/>

    with his virtuous fellows in the godly life;<br/>

    this also is a way of being considerate,<br/>

    which endears,<br/>

    brings honour,<br/>

    leads to concord,<br/>

    banishes contention,<br/>

    leads to unity,<br/>

    leads to singleness of heart.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And those virtues that are unbroken,<br/>

    without flaw,<br/>

    spotless,<br/>

    without blemish,<br/>

    bringing freedom,<br/>

    praised by wise men,<br/>

    incorruptible,<br/>

    leading to concentration -<br/>

    he dwells one in virtue with them<br/>

    among his fellows in the godly life,<br/>

    openly and in private;<br/>

    this also is a way of being considerate,<br/>

    which endears,<br/>

    brings honour,<br/>

    leads to concord,<br/>

    banishes contention,<br/>

    leads to unity,<br/>

    leads to singleness of heart.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And that Ariyan view,<br/>

    saving,<br/>

    leading him who acts accordantly<br/>

    to the utter destruction of Ill -<br/>

    he dwells one in view with that<br/>

    among his fellows in the godly life,<br/>

    openly and in private;<br/>

    this also is a way of being considerate,<br/>

    which endears,<br/>

    brings honour,<br/>

    leads to concord,<br/>

    banishes contention,<br/>

    leads to unity,<br/>

    leads to singleness of heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the six ways of being considerate, which endear,<br/>

    bring honour,<br/>

    lead to concord,<br/>

    banish contention,<br/>

    lead to unity,<br/>

    lead to singleness of heart.'</p>
