    <h1>Without Remorse</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Reverend sir!'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, friend,' they replied.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The more, reverend sirs, a monk thus fashions his life,<br/>

    the more he fashions it to a remorseful fate.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, reverend sirs,<br/>

    does a monk fashion his life<br/>

    to a remorseful fate?</p>

    <p class="f4">Consider, reverend sirs,<br/>

    the monk who,<br/>

    finding delight in worldly activity,<br/>

    is delighted with worldly activity,<br/>

    gets engrossed in the delight of worldly activity;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">who, finding delight in talk,<br/>

    is delighted with talk,<br/>

    gets engrossed in the delight of talk;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">who, finding delight in sleep,<br/>

    is delighted with sleep,<br/>

    gets engrossed in the delight of sleep;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">who, finding delight in company,<br/>

    is delighted with company,<br/>

    gets engrossed in the delight of company;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">who, finding delight in companionship<br/>

    is delighted with companionship,<br/>

    gets engrossed in the delight of companionship;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">who, finding delight in vain fancies -<br/>

    is delighted with vain fancies,<br/>

    gets engrossed in the delight of vain fancies;<br/>

    and thus, reverend sirs,<br/>

    the more he so fashions his life,<br/>

    the more he fashions it to a remorseful fate;<br/>

    and of this monk it is said:</p>

    <p class="f4">With his bundle of life<br/>

    he is greatly delighted;<br/>

    he has not got rid of his bundle<br/>

    for the utter ending of Ill.|| ||</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But the more, reverend sirs,<br/>

    a monk fashions his life in this manner,<br/>

    the more he fashions it to a fate without remorse.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, reverend sirs,<br/>

    does a monk fashion his life<br/>

    to a fate without remorse?</p>

    <p class="f4">Consider the monk who,<br/>

    finding no delight in worldly activity,<br/>

    is not delighted therewith,<br/>

    gets not engrossed in the delight thereof;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">who, finding no delight in talk,<br/>

    is not delighted with talk,<br/>

    gets not engrossed in the delight of talk;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">who, finding no delight in sleep,<br/>

    is not delighted with sleep,<br/>

    gets not engrossed in the delight of sleep;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">who, finding no delight in company,<br/>

    is not delighted with company,<br/>

    gets not engrossed in the delight of company;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">who, finding no delight in companionship<br/>

    is not delighted with companionship,<br/>

    gets not engrossed in the delight of companionship;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">who, finding no delight in vain fancies -<br/>

    is not delighted with vain fancies,<br/>

    gets not engrossed in the delight of vain fancies;<br/>

    and thus the more he so fashions his life,<br/>

    the more he fashions it to a fate without remorse;<br/>

    and of him it is said:</p>

    <p class="f4">With Nibbāna he is greatly delighted;<br/>

    he has got rid of his bundle of life<br/>

    for the utter ending of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Fancy-ensnarled, fawn-like too fancy-fond,<br/>

    Ne'er wins he blest Nibbāna's boundless peace:<br/>

    But fancy-rid, intent on freedom's way,<br/>

    He wins to blest Nibbāna's boundless peace.'</p>
