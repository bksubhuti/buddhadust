    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, while the Exalted One was dwelling among the Bhaggis on Crocodile Hill<br/>

    in the Deer Park at Bhesakaḷā <span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span> Grove,<br/>

    the goodman of the house,<br/>

    Nakula's father,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> lay sick sad ailing,<br/>

    grievously ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now his dame, Nakula's mother,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> spoke thus to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I prithee, goodman, die not fretfully;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    ill is the fate of the fretful;<br/>

    decried by the Exalted One<br/>

    is the fate of the fretful.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Maybe, goodman, you think:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Alas, when I am gone,<br/>

    the goodwife, Nakula's mother,<br/>

    will not be able<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> to support the children,<br/>

    nor keep the household together!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But think not so, goodman;<br/>

    for I am deft at spinning cotton,<br/>

    at carding<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> the matted wool;<br/>

    and I can support the children,<br/>

    keep the household,<br/>

    after you have gone.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, goodman,<br/>

    die not fretfully;<br/>

    ill is the fate of the fretful;<br/>

    decried by the Exalted One<br/>

    is the fate of the fretful.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or maybe you think:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The goodwife, when I am gone,<br/>

    will go to another man!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But think not so, goodman;<br/>

    for you and I know<br/>

    how for sixteen years<br/>

    we have lived, as housefolk,<br/>

    the godly life.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, goodman,<br/>

    die not fretfully;<br/>

    ill is the fate of the fretful;<br/>

    decried by the Exalted One<br/>

    is the fate of the fretful.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Or maybe you think:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The goodwife, after I am gone,<br/>

    will have no desire to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    no desire to see the monks of the Order!"</p>

    <p class="f4">But think not so, goodman;<br/>

    for, verily, when you are gone,<br/>

    greater shall be my desire to see the Exalted One<br/>

    greater shall be my desire to see the Order.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, goodman,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Or maybe you think:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The goodwife, after I am gone,<br/>

    will not keep the virtues in full!"</p>

    <p class="f4">But thlnk not so, goodman;<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span> so long as the Exalted One shall have white-robed women lay-diaciples,<br/>

    his sickness subsided;<br/>
