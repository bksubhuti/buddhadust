    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One<br/>

    with a great company of monks<br/>

    walked a walk among the Kosalese,<br/>

    he saw, as he went along the highway,<br/>

    a fisherman,<br/>

    who had caught a haul of fish<br/>

    and was selling them as a fishmonger;<br/>

    and the Exalted One at the sight<br/>

    stepped off the road<br/>

    and sat down at the foot of a tree<br/>

    on a seat made ready for him.</p>

    <p class="f4">And, sitting there, he said to the monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, see you that fisherman<br/>

    who has caught a haul of fish<br/>

    and is selling them as a fishmonger?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord.'</p>

    have you either seen or heard<br/>

    of a fisherman fishmonger<br/>

    slaughtering and selling fish;<br/>
