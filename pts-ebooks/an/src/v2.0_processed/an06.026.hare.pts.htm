    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Mahā Kaccāna was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the venerable Mahā Kaccāna addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, reverend sirs!.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Reverend sir!' they rejoined;<br/>

    and the venerable one said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is wonderful, reverend sirs;<br/>

    it is amazing<br/>

    how the escape from the noose<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    was conceived by that Exalted One,<br/>

    knower,<br/>

    seer,<br/>

    arahant,<br/>

    fully awake -<br/>

    to purge man,<br/>

    overcome grief and woe,<br/>

    clear away pain and distress,<br/>

    win truth,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    realize Nibbāna -<br/>

    I mean the six states of ever minding.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Consider, reverend sirs, the Ariyan disciple who is ever minding the Tathāgata:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He is the Exalted One,<br/>

    arahant,<br/>

    fully enlightened,<br/>

    perfected in knowledge and way of life,<br/>

    one well-gone,<br/>

    a knower of the worlds,<br/>

    none higher,<br/>

    a tamer of tamable men,<br/>

    a teacher,<br/>

    the awake among devas and men,<br/>

    the Exalted One!'</p>

    <p class="f4">When he so minds him,<br/>

    his heart is not lust-obsessed,<br/>

    nor hate-obsessed,<br/>

    nor obsessed by infatuation;<br/>

    upright in heart is he at that time,<br/>

    moved,<br/>

    freed,<br/>

    raised from greed;<br/>

    and this greed, monks,<br/>

    is a name for the fivefold sensuous pleasures;<br/>

    and, sirs, that Ariyan disciple<br/>

    lives at all times<br/>

    with heart spacious,<br/>

    large,<br/>

    lofty,<br/>

    boundless,<br/>

    free of hatred and ill-will.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, reverend sirs,<br/>

    by making this thought their object,<br/>

    some men thereby become pure in nature.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds Dhamma:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma,<br/>

    a view for this life,<br/>

    nor for this only,<br/>

    bidding come and see,<br/>

    a guide,<br/>

    to be known by the wise<br/>

    each for himself."</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, what time the Ariyan disciple minds the Dhamma,<br/>

    some men thereby become pure in nature.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the Order:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Exalted One's Order of disciples<br/>

    has rightly stepped the way,<br/>

    has straightly stepped the way,<br/>

    has fitly stepped the way,<br/>

    has wholly stepped the way,<br/>

    that is:<br/>

    the four pairs among men,<br/>

    the eight persons among mankind;<br/>

    and this Order of disciples of the Exalted One<br/>

    is worthy of offerings,<br/>

    worthy of gifts,<br/>

    worthy of oblations,<br/>

    the world's peerless field for merit."</p>

    some men thereby become pure in nature.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the virtues in himself:</p>

    <p class="f4">"They are unbroken,<br/>

    without a flaw,<br/>

    spotless,<br/>

    without blemish;<br/>

    they bring freedom<br/>

    and are praised by wise men;<br/>

    indeed I have greatly gained,<br/>

    I who among folk, overwhelmed by the taint of stinginess,<br/>

    live the home-life heart-free of the stingy taint,<br/>
