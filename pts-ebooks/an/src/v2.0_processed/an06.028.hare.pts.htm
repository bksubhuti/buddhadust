    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, when many elders dwelt at the Deer Park in Isipatana, near Benares,<br/>

    there arose by chance this talk among them,<br/>

    as they sat assembled in the round hall,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    after breakfast,<br/>

    on their return from alms-collecting:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What's the proper time, reverend sirs,<br/>

    to go and see a monk<br/>

    who is a student of mind?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now having stated this,<br/>

    a certain monk said to the elders:</p>

    <p class="f4">'When, reverend sirs, a monk,<br/>

    a student of mind,<br/>

    has returned from alms-collecting,<br/>

    breakfasted,<br/>

    washed his feet,<br/>

    seated himself,<br/>

    crossed his legs,<br/>

    straightened his body<br/>

    and made mindfulness stand up,<br/>

    as it were,<br/>

    before him;<br/>

    then is the time to go and see a monk<br/>

    who is a student of mind.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And after he had thus spoken, another said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Nay, reverend sirs,<br/>

    that is not the time to go and see a monk<br/>

    who is a student of mind;<br/>

    for when he has returned from alms-collecting,<br/>

    breakfasted,<br/>

    washed his feet,<br/>

    seated himself,<br/>

    crossed his legs,<br/>

    straightened his body<br/>

    and made mindfulness stand up,<br/>

    as it were,<br/>

    before him;<br/>

    he is languid from his walk<br/>

    and is not then completely at ease;<br/>

    or he is languid after his meal<br/>

    and is not then completely at ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore that is not the time,<br/>

    to go and see a monk<br/>

    who is a student of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when, sirs, in the evening<br/>

    he has risen from seclusion<br/>

    and is seated in the shade of his lodging,<br/>

    cross-legged,<br/>

    with body erect,<br/>

    with mindfulness set before him;<br/>

    then is the time to go and see a monk<br/>

    who is a student of mind.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said another:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Nay, verily, reverend sirs,<br/>

    that is not the time to go and see a monk<br/>

    who is a student of mind; for when, reverend sirs, in the evening<br/>

    he has risen from seclusion<br/>

    and is seated in the shade of his lodging,<br/>

    cross-legged,<br/>

    with body erect,<br/>

    with mindfulness set before him<br/>

    whatsoever concentration-image<br/>

    he has by day concentrated on,<br/>

    just that will then beset him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore that is not the time<br/>

    to go and see that monk.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when, sirs, night recedes<br/>

    and day dawns<br/>

    and he is seated cross-legged<br/>

    with body erect<br/>

    with mindfulness set before him;<br/>

    then is the time to go and see a monk<br/>

    who is a student of mind.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">But another monk said:</p>
