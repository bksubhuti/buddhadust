    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these six things lead to failure for a monk in training.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Delight<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> in worldly activity,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    delight in sleep,<br/>

    delight in company,<br/>

    delight in being unguarded as to the doors of the senses<br/>

    delight in immoderate in eating.</p>
