    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">One morning the venerable Ānanda,<br/>

    robing early,<br/>

    took bowl and cloak<br/>

    and went to the house of the lay-disiple, Migasālā,<br/>

    <p class="f4">And Migasālā came<br/>

    and saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, she said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Pray, reverend sir,<br/>

    how ought one to understand this Dhamma<br/>

    taught by the Exalted One:<br/>

    that both he who lives the godly life<br/>

    and he who does not<br/>

    shall become like-wayfarers<br/>

    in the world to come?</p>

    <p class="f4">My father, sir, Purāṇa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    lived the godly life,<br/>

    abstaining from common,<br/>

    carnal things;<br/>

    and when he died,<br/>

    the Exalted One explained:</p>

    <p class="f4">He's a Once-returner,<br/>

    dwelling in Tusita.</p>

    <p class="f4">My unde,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> sir, Isidatta,<br/>

    did not live the godly life<br/>

    but rejoiced with a wife;<br/>

    and of him also,<br/>

    when dead,<br/>

    the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'And when the venerable Ānanda had received alms in Migasālā's house,<br/>

    he rose from his seat and departed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on his return from alms-gathering,<br/>

    after his meal,<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda visited the Exalted One,<br/>

    saluted him<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[247]</b></span> and sat down at one side;<br/>

    and so seated,<br/>

    he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p>Bhk. Bodhi [here and in AN 10.75] has made better sense of this this than either Woodward or Hare:<br/>

    <i>"...if Isidatta had possessed the same kind of virtuous behavior that Purāṇa had, Purāṇa could not have even known his destination. And if Purāṇa had possessed the same kind of wisdom that Isidatta had, Isidatta could not have even known his destination. In this way, Ānanda, these two persons were each deficient in one respect."</i><br/>

    by "not even known his destination" is meant that had the deficient quality been present, that one would have become Arahant.</p>
