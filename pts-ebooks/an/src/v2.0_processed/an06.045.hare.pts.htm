    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, is poverty a woeful thing<br/>

    for a worldly wanton?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'And when a man is poor,<br/>

    needy,<br/>

    in straits,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    and thought,<br/>

    on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>

    is bound in hell's bonds<br/>

    or the bonds of some beast's womb;<br/>

    and I see no other single bondage, monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    so harsh,<br/>

    so bitter,<br/>

    such a bar<br/>

    to winning the un-surpassed peace from effort -<br/>

    I mean,<br/>

    hell's bonds<br/>

    or the bonds of a beast's womb.</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Woeful i'the world is poverty and debt<br/>

    'Tis said. See<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> how the poor wanton, plunged in debt,<br/>

    Suffers, is then beset, e'en bound with bonds -<br/>

    A woe indeed for one who pleasure craves!<br/>

    So in the Ariyan discipline, who lives<br/>

    Sans faith, sans shame, sans fear of blame, fashions<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[251]</b></span> Ill deeds and, working evilly in deed,<br/>

    In word and thought, hopes none shall know of it.<br/>

    Wavering<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> in deed, in word, in thought, he breeds<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/>

    A brood of evil deeds, here, there, again -<br/>

    Fool, evil-doer, who knows his own misdeeds,<br/>

    He suffers as the wanton, plunged in debt!<br/>

    Longings and evil thoughts in forest, town,<br/>

    Beset him then, with black remorse's horde<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> -<br/>

    Fool, evil-doer, who knows his own misdeeds,<br/>

    For him a beast's womb waits or bonds in hell;<br/>

    Those woeful bonds from which the sage is freed.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Who, gladdening, gives from plenty, justly won,<br/>

    Casting a win both ways<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span>-believing man,<br/>

    Seeker of homely joys - for him here's weal,<br/>

    Hereafter, bliss. Such is the goodman's standard,<br/>

    For merit grows by generosity.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/>

    So in the Ariyan discipline, who's set<br/>

    In faith, wise, modest and by virtue ruled,<br/>

    Is called "blythe dweller" in that discipline.<br/>

    Erstwhile unsullied bliss he wins, then poise<br/>

    Preserves;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span> the five bars<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span> passed, with ardent zeal,<br/>

    The musings enters, watchful, apt, intent;<br/>

    Breaks all the bonds and knows reality;<br/>

    And grasping naught, wholly his heart's released.<br/>

    If in that high release, where life's<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span> bonds break,<br/>

    This gnosis comes: "Immutable's release!"<br/>

    Then is that gnosis final, unsurpassed<br/>

    That bliss, a griefiess state of passionless peace -<br/>

    That (for the saint) is debtlessness supreme.'</p>
