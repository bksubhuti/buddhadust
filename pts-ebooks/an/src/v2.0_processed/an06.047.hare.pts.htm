    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Sīvaka of the Top-knot,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    a wanderer,<br/>

    visited the Exalted One,<br/>

    greeted him<br/>

    and, after exchanging the usual compliments,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'They say, sir,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Dhamma's for this life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    Dhamma's for this life!"</p>

    <p class="f4">But how, sir, is Dhamma for this life,<br/>

    for other worlds,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    bidding "Come see,"<br/>

    leading onwards,<br/>

    knowable to the wise by its relation to self?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, Sīvaka,<br/>

    I will just question you in turn about this;<br/>

    answer as you please.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, Sīvaka,<br/>

    suppose there's greed here in the self,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    would you know:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There's greed here in myself" -</p>

    <p class="f4">or suppose there's no greed,<br/>

    would you know: </p>

    <p class="f4">"There is no greed here in myself"?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely, sir.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, when you know<br/>

    <p class="f4">This, indeed, is wonderful, Master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">'Tis just as if one had set upright a thing toppled over,<br/>

    opened out a covered thing,<br/>

    showed a blind man along the road,<br/>

    brought an oil lamp into the dark,<br/>

    it is just thus that Dhamma<br/>

    has been blazed abroad by Master Gotama<br/>

    in manifold ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, Master Gotama,<br/>

    go to Master Gotama for refuge,<br/>

    to Dhamma<br/>

    and to the monk-Order;<br/>

    let Master Gotama look upon me as a lay-disciple,<br/>

    to that refuge gone,<br/>

    henceforth as long as life lasts!'</p>
