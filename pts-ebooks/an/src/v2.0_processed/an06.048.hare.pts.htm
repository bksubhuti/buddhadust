    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">A brāhman,<br/>

    approached the Exalted One,<br/>

    greeted him<br/>

    and, after exchanging the usual compliments,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'They say, sir,</p>

    <p class="f4">"Dhamma's for this life,<br/>

    Dhamma's for this life!"</p>

    <p class="f4">But how, sir, is Dhamma for this life,<br/>

    for other worlds,<br/>

    bidding "Come see,"<br/>

    leading onwards,<br/>

    knowable to the wise by its relation to self?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, brāhman,<br/>

    I will just question you in turn about this;<br/>

    answer as you please.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, brāhman,<br/>

    suppose there's passion here in the self,<br/>

    would you know:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There's passion here in myself" -</p>

    <p class="f4">or suppose there's no passion,<br/>

    would you know: </p>

    <p class="f4">"There is no passion here in myself"?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely, sir.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, when you know<br/>

    "There's passion here in myself"<br/>

    when you know<br/>

    "There is no passion here in myself"<br/>

    thus is Dhamma for this life,<br/>

    for other worlds,<br/>

    bidding "Come see,"<br/>

    leading onwards,<br/>

    knowable to the wise<br/>

    by its relation to self.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, brāhman,<br/>

    suppose there's hatred here in the self,<br/>

    would you know:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There's hatred here in myself" -</p>

    <p class="f4">or suppose there's no hatred,<br/>

    would you know: </p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, brāhman,<br/>

    suppose there's infatuation here in the self,<br/>

    would you know:</p>

    <p class="f4">or suppose there's no infatuation,<br/>

    <p class="f4">This, indeed, is wonderful, Master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">'Tis just as if one had set upright a thing toppled over,<br/>

    opened out a covered thing,<br/>

    showed a blind man along the road,<br/>

    brought an oil lamp into the dark,<br/>

    so that those that had eyes could see objects —<br/>

    it is just thus that Dhamma<br/>

    has been blazed abroad by Master Gotama<br/>

    in manifold ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, Master Gotama,<br/>

    go to Master Gotama for refuge,<br/>

    to Dhamma<br/>

    and to the monk-Order;<br/>

    let Master Gotama look upon me as a lay-disciple,<br/>

    to that refuge gone,<br/>

    henceforth as long as life lasts!'</p>
