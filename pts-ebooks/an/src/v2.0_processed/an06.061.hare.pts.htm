    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[284]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One dwelt near Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<br/>

    a number of elders,<br/>

    who had returned from alms-gathering, and fed,<br/>

    sat together in the round hall;<br/>

    and this talk by change arose:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This, sirs, was said by the Exalted One<br/>

    in "The Way to the Beyond,"<br/>

    in the questions of Metteyya.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in1">"Who knows both ends — not midst<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> that sage is soiled:<br/>

    Him call I 'great man'; he here hath passed the seamstress."</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, pray, is the first end,<br/>

    what's the second,<br/>

    what's in the middle<br/>

    and who's the seamstress?'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[2][olds]</span> Now after this had been said,<br/>

    one of the monks answered the elders and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Contact, sirs, is the first end,<br/>

    its arising is the second,<br/>

    its ceasing is in the middle,<br/>

    and craving is the seamstress;<br/>

    for craving sews one<br/>

    just to this ever-becoming birth.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>

    a monk knows the know- <span class="f2 g"><b>[285]</b></span> able,<br/>

    comprehends the comprehensible;<br/>

    and knowing the knowable,<br/>

    comprehending the comprehensible,<br/>

    he makes an end of Ill,<br/>

    here now.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[3][olds]</span> And when he had thus spoken, another said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The past is the first end,<br/>

    the future the second,<br/>

    the present is in the middle,<br/>

    and craving is the seamstress;<br/>

    for craving sews one<br/>

    just to this ever-becoming birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>

    a monk knows the knowable,<br/>

    comprehends the comprehensible;<br/>

    and knowing the knowable,<br/>

    comprehending the comprehensible,<br/>

    here now.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[4][olds]</span> And another said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Pleasure<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> is the first end,<br/>

    pain is the second,<br/>

    indifference is in the middle,<br/>

    and craving is the seamstress;<br/>

    for craving sews one<br/>

    just to this ever-becoming birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>

    a monk knows the knowable,<br/>

    comprehends the comprehensible;<br/>

    and knowing the knowable,<br/>

    comprehending the comprehensible,<br/>

    he makes an end of Ill,<br/>

    here now.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[5][olds]</span> And another said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Name is the first end,<br/>

    form is the second,<br/>

    consciousness is in the middle,<br/>

    and craving is the seamstress;<br/>

    for craving sews one<br/>

    just to this ever-becoming birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>

    a monk knows the knowable,<br/>

    comprehends the comprehensible;<br/>

    and knowing the knowable,<br/>

    comprehending the comprehensible,<br/>

    he makes an end of Ill,<br/>

    here now.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[6][olds]</span> And another said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'One's six sense-organs are the first end,<br/>

    the other six outer objects are the second,<br/>

    consciousness is in the middle,<br/>

    and craving is the seamstress;<br/>

    for craving sews one<br/>

    just to this ever-becoming birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>

    a monk knows the knowable,<br/>

    comprehends the comprehensible;<br/>

    and knowing the knowable,<br/>

    he makes an end of Ill,<br/>

    here now.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[7][olds]</span> And another said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Life's bundle<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> is the first end,<br/>

    its arising is the second,<br/>

    its ceasing is in the middle,<br/>

    and craving is the seamstress;<br/>

    for craving sews one<br/>

    just to this ever-becoming birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, to this extent<br/>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[8][olds]</span> And when he had finished speaking,<br/>

    another monk addressed the elders and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'We have all, reverend sirs,<br/>

    replied as the matter appeared to each one of us.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let us go and visit the Exalted One<br/>

    and tell him.</p>

    <p class="f4">As the Exalted One declares,<br/>

    so will we bear in mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Very well,' rejoined the elders;<br/>

    and they approached the Exalted One,<br/>

    saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">And so seated, they told him all the words and talk that had passed between them, adding:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, who spoke best?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Each one of you, monks,<br/>

    in his own way<br/>

    spoke well;<br/>

    but as to what I spoke of in<br/>

    "The Way to the Beyond,"<br/>

    in Metteyya's questions:</p>

    <p class="f4 in1"><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span> "Who knows both ends — not midst that sage is soiled:<br/>

    Him call I 'great man'; he here hath passed the seamstress."</p>

    <p class="f4">listen,<br/>

    pay good heed,<br/>

    I will speak!'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Verily, contact, monks, is the first end,<br/>

    its arising is the second,<br/>

    its ceasing is in the middle,<br/>

    and craving is the seamstress;<br/>

    for craving sews a man<br/>

    just to this ever-becoming birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, it is to this extent<br/>

    that a monk knows the knowable,<br/>

    comprehends the comprehensible;<br/>

    and knowing the knowable,<br/>

    comprehending the comprehensible,<br/>

    he makes an end of Ill,<br/>

    here now.'</p>
