    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Verily, monks, that a monk who is an evil friend,<br/>

    an evil comrade,<br/>

    an evil companion,<br/>

    serving,<br/>

    attending,<br/>

    honouring evil friends,<br/>

    emulating their ways of thought,<br/>

    shall fulfil the Dhamma-fore-course<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> -<br/>

    that cannot be;</p>

    <p class="f4">and that without fulfilling the course,<br/>

    he shall fulfil the Dhamma-training -<br/>

    that cannot be;</p>

    <p class="f4">and that without fulfilling the training,<br/>

    he shall fulfil the virtues -<br/>

    that cannot be;</p>

    <p class="f4">and that without fulfilling the virtues,<br/>

    he shall give up lustful passion,<br/>

    passion for the material<br/>

    or for the immaterial -<br/>

    that cannot be.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Abhi-sam-ācār-ika dhamma;</i> see above V, § 21.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> It seems a jumble here, that <i>sīlāni</i> should not have come first, since they must be presupposed in the foregoing. Unless the four <i>brahma-vihāras</i> are meant by <i>sīlāni.</i> Possibly a corrupt recension.</p>
