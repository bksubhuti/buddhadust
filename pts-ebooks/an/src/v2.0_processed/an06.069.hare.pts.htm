    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> when the night was well advanced,<br/>

    a deva,<br/>

    shedding rays of far-reaching loveliness<br/>

    over Jeta Grove,<br/>

    visited the Exalted One,<br/>

    saluted<br/>

    and stood at one side;<br/>

    and, so standing,<br/>

    he spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, there are these six thüigs<br/>

    that lead not to a monk's falling away.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Reverence for Teacher,<br/>

    reverence for the Dhamma<br/>

    reverence for the Order,<br/>

    reverence for the training,<br/>

    grace in speech<br/>

    and good friendship.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lord, these six things<br/>

    lead not to a monk's falling away.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke that deva<br/>

    and the Teacher approved.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the deva,<br/>

    perceiving that the Master agreed,<br/>

    saluted<br/>

    and disappeared thence,<br/>

    keeping the Exalted One on his right.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, at the end of that night,<br/>

    the Exalted One addressed the monks<br/>

    and told them:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, when the night was well advanced,<br/>

    a deva,<br/>

    shedding rays of far-reaching loveliness<br/>

    over Jeta Grove,<br/>

    visited me,<br/>

    saluted<br/>

    and stood at one side;<br/>

    and, so standing,<br/>

    he spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, there are these six thüigs<br/>

    <p class="f4">Lord, these six things<br/>

    lead not to a monk's falling away."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke that deva and I approved.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the deva,<br/>

    perceiving that I agreed,<br/>

    saluted<br/>

    and disappeared thence,<br/>

    keeping me on his right.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[299]</b></span> And when he had spoken,<br/>

    the venerable Sāriputta saluted the Exalted One<br/>

    and said:</p>
