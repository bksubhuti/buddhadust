    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk be possessed of six things,<br/>

    he cannot become this and that,<br/>

    so as to be bound personally to attain,<br/>

    given the opportunity.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[300]</b></span> Suppose, monks, a monk know not as a fact:</p>

    <p class="f4">"These<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> things partake of failure,"</p>

    <p class="f4">or,</p>

    <p class="f4">"These things partake of stability,"</p>

    <p class="f4">or,</p>

    <p class="f4">"These things partake of distinction,"</p>

    <p class="f4">or,</p>

    <p class="f4">"These things partake of penetration,"</p>

    <p class="f4">nor is he zealous<br/>

    nor helpful.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if a monk be possessed of these six,<br/>

    he cannot become this and that,<br/>

    so as to be bound personally to attain,<br/>

    given the opportunity.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, if a monk be possessed of six things,<br/>

    he can become this and that,<br/>

    so as to be bound personally to attain,<br/>

    given the opportunity.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, monks, a monk know as a fact:</p>
