    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk be possessed of six things,<br/>

    he cannot win strength in concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, monks, a monk be not skilled in attaining concentration,<br/>

    nor skilled in maintaining concentration,<br/>

    nor skilled in emerging therefrom,<br/>

    nor is he zealous,<br/>

    nor persevering<br/>

    nor helpful.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if a monk be possessed of these six,<br/>

    he cannot win strength in concentration.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, if a monk be possessed of six things,<br/>

    he can win strength in concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, monks, a monk be skilled in attaining concentration,<br/>

    skilled in maintaining concentration,<br/>

    skilled in emerging therefrom,<br/>

    is zealous,<br/>

    persevering<br/>

    helpful.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if a monk be possessed of these six,<br/>

    he can win strength in concentration.'</p>
