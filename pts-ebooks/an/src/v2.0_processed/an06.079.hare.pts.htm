    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk possess six things,<br/>

    he cannot attain unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>

    nor increase his skill attained therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk is unskilled in entering,<br/>

    in leaving,<br/>

    in approach,<br/>

    has no wish to attain unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>

    preserves not his skill attained,<br/>

    nor stirs to persevere.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, if a monk possess these six,<br/>

    he cannot attain <span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span> unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>

    nor increase his skill attained therein.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, if a monk possess six things,<br/>

    he can attain unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>

    and increase his skill attained therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk is skilled in entering,<br/>

    in leaving,<br/>

    in approach,<br/>

    has the wish to attain unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>

    preserves his skill attained,<br/>

    and stirs to persevere.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, if a monk possess these six things,<br/>

    he can attain unattained skill in Dhamma,<br/>

    and increase his skill attained therein.</p>
