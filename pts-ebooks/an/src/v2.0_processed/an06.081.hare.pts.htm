    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, following six things,<br/>

    one is duly cast in hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">One takes life,<br/>

    takes what is not given,<br/>

    lives carnally,<br/>

    lies,<br/>

    has evil desires<br/>

    and wrong views.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, following these six,<br/>

    one is duly cast in hell.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, following six things,<br/>

    one is duly cast in heaven.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">One abstains from taking life,<br/>

    one abstains from taking what is not given,<br/>

    one abstains from living carnally,<br/>

    one abstains from lies,<br/>

    one has few desires<br/>

    one has right views.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, following these six,<br/>

    one is duly cast in heaven.'</p>
