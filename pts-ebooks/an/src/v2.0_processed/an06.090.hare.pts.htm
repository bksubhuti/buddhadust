    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these six things are given up<br/>

    by a person who has achieved right view.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?'</p>

    <p class="f4">The wrong view of life's bundle,<br/>

    doubt,<br/>

    belief in the adequacy of rule and rite,<br/>

    passion that leads to the ill way,<br/>

    hate leads to the ill way,<br/>

    infatuation leads to the ill way.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these six things are given up<br/>

    by a person who has achieved right view.</p>
