    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six occasions which cannot become.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">One who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one who will accept any phenomenon as permanent,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot accept any phenomenon as happiness,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot accept any thing as self,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot do an unpardonable act,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot fall back on curious ceremonies<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> for purification,</p>

    <p>Hare's translation of the last item is misleading. In several places persons who have become streamwinners are urged to continue to give gifts to other teachers as previously, and we are told that even scraping the dinner scraps into the sewer with the idea of feeding the creatures living there will result in good kamma. The idea is 'to honor by way of a gift'. Elsewhere [see AN 6.94] this is rendered as being incapable of honoring by placing faith in some other teacher than the Buddha.</p>
