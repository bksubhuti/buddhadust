    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six occasions<br/>

    which cannot become.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">One who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one who will take his mother's life,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one who will take his father's life,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one who will take an arahant's life,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one who with evil mind draw the blood of the Tathāgata,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one to embroil the Order,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">one who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one to point to another teacher.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the six occasions<br/>

    which cannot become.'</p>
