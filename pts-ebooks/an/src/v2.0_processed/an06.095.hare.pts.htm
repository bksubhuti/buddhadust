    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six occasions<br/>

    which cannot become.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">He who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one<br/>

    who will fall back on the view<br/>

    that weal and woe<br/>

    are self-wrought;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one<br/>

    who will fall back on the view<br/>

    that weal and woe<br/>

    are wrought by another;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one<br/>

    who will fall back on the view<br/>

    that weal and woe<br/>

    are wrought both by oneself and another;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one<br/>

    who will fall back on the view<br/>

    that weal and woe<br/>

    arise by chance,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    are wrought without act of the self;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he who has achieved right view<br/>

    cannot become one<br/>

    who will fall back on the view<br/>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is the cause of that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Truly, monks, to one who has achieved right view<br/>

    cause and the causal origin of things<br/>

    are rightly discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the six occasions<br/>

    which cannot become.'</p>
