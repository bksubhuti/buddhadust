    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Hare omits the positive series. His use of the word 'cumbered' for the negative attributes makes the conversion to the positive awkward because one cannot say of an attribute that isn't there that it is an encumberance, or that one is unencumbered by it, but it has been left as is.</p>
