    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, by getting rid of,<br/>

    by cutting away seven leanings<br/>

    the godly life is lived.</p>
