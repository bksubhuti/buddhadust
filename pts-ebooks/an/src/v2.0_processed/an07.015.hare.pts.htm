    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these seven persons,<br/>

    like men in water,<br/>

    are found living in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, one person plunges once and drowns;<br/>

    one comes up and plunges again;<br/>

    one comes up and stays;<br/>

    one comes up, looks, sees;<br/>

    one comes up and crosses;<br/>

    one comes up won to firm ground;<br/>

    and one comes up crossed over,<br/>

    gone to the beyond,<br/>

    and stands on high ground,<br/>

    a brahman.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And how plunges a person once and drowns?</p>

    <p class="f4">Consider the person whose ways are wholly black and evil;<br/>

    it is thus, monks, he plunges once and drowns.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how comes a person up and plunges again?</p>

    <p class="f4">Consider him who comes up and thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well is faith in right,<br/>

    well is conscientiousness,<br/>

    well is fear of blame,<br/>

    well is energy,<br/>

    well is wisdom as to right things!" -<br/>

    and that faith of his,<br/>

    that conscientiousness,<br/>

    fear of blame,<br/>

    energy,<br/>

    that wisdom stays not,<br/>

    waxes not,<br/>

    but wanes;<br/>

    and breaking the three fetters,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> he becomes a Streamwinner,<br/>

    sure,<br/>

    certain for full awakening;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    and breaking the three fetters,<br/>

    lessening passion,<br/>

    hatred,<br/>

    delusion,<br/>

    he becomes a Once-retumer<br/>

    who returns to this world once only<br/>

    and makes an end of ill;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    becoming completely cool,<br/>

    destroying the cankers,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the cankerless mind-emancipation,<br/>

    wisdom-emancipation,<br/>

    here and now,<br/>

    realizing it himself by knowledge;<br/>

    it is thus, monks, he comes up,<br/>

    crossed over,<br/>

    gone to the beyond,<br/>

    and stands on high ground,<br/>

    a brahman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these seven persons,<br/>
