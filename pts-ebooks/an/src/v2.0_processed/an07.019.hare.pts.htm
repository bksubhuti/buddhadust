    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>Once the Exalted One dwelt near Vesāli at Sārandada shrine;<br/>

    and there a number of Licchavis visited him and saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed them thus seated and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Licchavis, I will teach you seven things<br/>

    that cause not decline;<br/>

    listen,<br/>

    give heed,<br/>

    I will speak!'</p>
