    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, while dwelling on Mount Vulture Peak,<br/>

    the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you seven things that cause not decline;<br/>

    listen,<br/>

    pay heed,<br/>

    I win speak!'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' the monks rejoined;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"And what, monks, are these seven things<br/>

    that cause not decline?</p>

    <p class="f4">So long as the monks shall be often assembled,<br/>

    much in assembly,<br/>

    growth may be expected,<br/>

    not decline;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">so long as they shall sit down in concord,<br/>

    rise up in concord,<br/>

    do business in concord,<br/>

    growth may be expected,<br/>

    not decline;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">so long as they shall not decree the undecreed,<br/>

    nor repeal the decreed,<br/>

    but conform to the decreed training,<br/>

    growth may be expected,<br/>

    not decline;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">so long as they shall honour,<br/>

    respect,<br/>

    venerate;<br/>

    revere the elders,<br/>

    monks of experience,<br/>

    long gone forth,<br/>

    fathers of the Order,<br/>

    leaders of the Order,<br/>

    and deem them worthy to be heard,<br/>

    growth may be expected,<br/>

    not decline;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">so long as they shall fall not into the power of craving's surge,<br/>

    the cause of renewed becoming,<br/>

    growth may be expected,<br/>

    not decline;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">so long as they shall cleave<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> to the forest bed and seat,<br/>

    growth may be expected,<br/>

    not decline;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">so long as they shall each in himself make mindfulness stand up,<br/>

    and it shall be known<br/>

    that pious men in godly fellowship<br/>

    may come there from abroad<br/>

    and that those there dwell in comfort -<br/>

    growth may be expected for the monks,<br/>

    not decline.</p>

    <p class="f4">And so long as these seven things that cause not decline<br/>

    shall endure among the monks<br/>

    and they shall live in conformity therewith,<br/>

    growth may be expected, not decline.</p>
