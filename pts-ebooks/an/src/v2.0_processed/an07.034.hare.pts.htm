    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this night a deva,<br/>

    whose surpassing loveliness<br/>

    lit up almost the whole of Jeta Grove,<br/>

    visited,<br/>

    saluted and stood at one side;<br/>

    and so standing,<br/>

    the deva spoke to me and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, these seven things lead not to a monk's decline.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">Reverence for the Master,<br/>

    Dhamma,<br/>

    Order,<br/>

    the training,<br/>

    concentration;<br/>

    fair speech<br/>

    and good friendship'.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, lord, these seven things lead not to a monk's decline.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake that deva, Monks,<br/>

    and I approved;<br/>

    and seeing this,<br/>

    the deva saluted<br/>

    and passed out on the right.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">3. And when he had thus spoken,<br/>

    the venerable Sāriputta said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">4. 'This speech, lord, of the Exalted One,<br/>

    so tersely put,<br/>
