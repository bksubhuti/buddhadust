    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, endowed with seven things,<br/>

    a monk makes the mind turn according to his wish<br/>

    and turns not by the mind's wish.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk is skilled in concentration,<br/>

    skilled in attaining it,<br/>
