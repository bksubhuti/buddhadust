    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][upal][olds]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you a Dhamma-discourse<br/>

    on bondage and on bond-freedom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pay heed,<br/>

    listen well,<br/>

    I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord" the monks rejoined;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"And what is the discourse<br/>

    on bondage and on bond-freedom?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, a woman marks femininity<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> in herself,<br/>

    the feminine occupation,<br/>

    attire,<br/>

    prejudices,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    impulses,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    voice,<br/>

    charm.</p>

    <p class="f4">She is excited by that,<br/>

    delighted by that;<br/>

    and being so excited,<br/>

    delighted,<br/>

    she marks masculinity about her,<br/>

    the masculine occupation,<br/>

    attire,<br/>

    prejudices,<br/>

    impulses,<br/>

    voice,<br/>

    charm.</p>

    <p class="f4">She is excited by that,<br/>

    delighted by that;<br/>

    and being so excited,<br/>

    delighted,<br/>

    she desires a bond<br/>

    with those about her;<br/>

    and whatsoever happiness,<br/>

    well-being<br/>

    comes of this bond<br/>

    that she desires.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[33]</b></span> Monks, delighted by,<br/>

    attached to her own sex,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    she has gone into man's bondage<br/>

    and thus escapes not from her own sex.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So, too, a man marks masculinity in himself,<br/>

    the masculin occupation,<br/>
