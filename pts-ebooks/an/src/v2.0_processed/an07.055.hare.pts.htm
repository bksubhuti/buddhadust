    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these four<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> need not be cloaked by the Tathāgata,<br/>

    and of three he is blameless.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">What four need not be cloaked?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, in bodily act the Tathāgata is wholly pure;<br/>

    there is no wrongdoing in deed by the Tathāgata<br/>

    which he would cloak, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let none know this of me."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, in act of word the Tathāgata is wholly pure;<br/>

    there is no wrongdoing in word by the Tathāgata<br/>

    which he would cloak, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let none know this of me."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, in act of thought the Tathāgata is wholly pure;<br/>

    there is no wrongdoing in thought by the Tathāgata<br/>

    which he would cloak, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let none know this of me."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, in mode of living<br/>

    the Tathāgata is wholly pure;<br/>

    there is no wrong mode of living by the Tathāgata<br/>

    which he would cloak, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let none know this of me."</p>

    <p class="f4">These four need not be cloaked by the Tathāgata.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what three is he blameless?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, the Tathāgata's Dhamma is well proclaimed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, truly, a recluse, brahman, deva, Mara, Brahmā<br/>

    or anyone in the world<br/>

    might with justice blame me, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In this way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> has Dhamma not been well proclaimed by you."</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, I see no sign of this;<br/>

    and, seeing no sign,<br/>

    I abide won to peace,<br/>

    won to fearlessness,<br/>

    won to confidence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, well made known by me to listeners<br/>

    are the steps <span class="f2 g"><b>[49]</b></span> in the way to the cool,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
