    <p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying in the Bamboo Grove near Kimbila,<br/>

    the venerable Kimbila approached him,<br/>

    saluted<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, what is the cause,<br/>

    the reason why,<br/>

    when the Tathāgata has become completely cool,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    Saddhamma will not last?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, Kimbila, when the Tathāgata has become completely cool,<br/>

    the monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen<br/>

    live without reverence, without heed for the teacher<br/>

    live without reverence, without heed for the Dhamma<br/>

    live without reverence, without heed for the the Order<br/>

    live without reverence, without heed for the the training<br/>

    live without reverence, without heed for concentration<br/>

    live without reverence, without heed for earnestness,<br/>

    live without reverence, without heed for goodwill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, Kimbila, this is the cause,<br/>

    the reason why,<br/>

    when the Tathāgata has become completely cool,<br/>

    Saddhamma will not last.'</p>
