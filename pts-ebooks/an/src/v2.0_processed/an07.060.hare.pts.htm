    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    being angry,<br/>

    is overwhelmed by anger;<br/>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this sort of person,<br/>

    being angry,<br/>

    is overwhelmed by anger;<br/>

    he is subverted by anger:<br/>

    and whatever his fame,<br/>

    diligently earned,<br/>

    it falls away from him,<br/>

    because of his anger.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this is the fifth condition,<br/>

    thought;<br/>

    so living,<br/>

    so speaking and<br/>

    so thinking,<br/>

    on the breaking up of the body after death<br/>

    he is reborn in the untoward way,<br/>

    fostered by rivals,<br/>

    causing rivals,<br/>

    which come upon an angry woman or man.</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">How ugly is an angry man! His sleep<br/>

    Is comfortless; with fortune in his hands<br/>

    He suffers loss; and being full of wrath<br/>

    He wounds by act and (bitter) word. O'erwhelmed<br/>

    By rage, his wealth he wastes away. Made mad<br/>

    And crazy by his bile, his name's bemired<br/>

    With odium.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> Shunned and forsaken is<br/>

    An angry man by friend and relative.<br/>

    By<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> wrath is loss incurred; by wrath the mind<br/>

    Is racked. Irate, he knows not that within<br/>

    Fear is engendered, nor knows the goal.<br/>

    When anger-bound, man Dhamma cannot see;<br/>

    When anger conquers man, blind darkness reigns.<br/>

    A man in wrath finds pleasure<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> in bad deeds<br/>

    As in good deeds; yet later, when his wrath<br/>

    Is spent, he suffers like one scorched by fire:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>

    As flame atop of smoke, he staggers on,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/>

    When anger spreads,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> when youth becomes incensed.<br/>

    No shame, no fear of blame, no reverence<br/>

    In speech<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> has he whose mind is anger rent;<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[62]</b></span> No island of support<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> he ever finds.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The deeds which bring remorse,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span> far from right states,<br/>

    These I'll proclaim. List how they come about.<br/>

    A man in anger will his father kill,<br/>

    In wrath, his very mother will he slay,<br/>

    Brāhman<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span> and common folk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span> alike he'll kill.<br/>

    'Tis but by mother's care man sees the light<br/>

    Of day, yet common average folk, in wrath,<br/>

    Will still destroy that fount of life (and love).<br/>

    Self-mirrored all these beings are; each one<br/>

    Loves most the self. In wrath the common folk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span><br/>

    Kill self, by divers forms distraught: by sword<br/>

    Men kill the self; in madness poison take;<br/>

    And in some hollow of a mountain glen<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span><br/>

    They hide, and bind themselves with ropes and die.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Thus ruin runs in wake of wrath, and they,<br/>

    Who act in wrath, perceive not that their deeds,<br/>

    Destroying life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span> bring death unto the self.<br/>

    Thus lurking in the heart is Mara's snare<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a></sup></span><br/>

    In anger's loathsome form. But root it out<br/>

    By insight, zeal, right view, restraint; the wise<br/>

    Would one by one each evil state root out<br/>

    And thus in Dhamma would he train himself:<br/>

    Be not our minds obscured, but anger freed<br/>

    And freed from trouble, greed and coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The well controlled, the canker-freed, become,<br/>

    When anger's stilled, wholly, completely cool.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a></sup></span></p>
