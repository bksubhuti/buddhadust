    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p>WARNING! Hare has the sense of the second section here exactly backwards, requiring knowledge and vision before even beginning! One starts with conscientiousness and fear of blame, that provides a basis for control of the senses, and so forth on <i>up to</i> knowledge and vision. Bhk. Bodhi has this correctly. Dukkha happens!</p>
