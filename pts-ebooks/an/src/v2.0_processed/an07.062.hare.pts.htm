    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">In bygone days, monks,<br/>

    there was a teacher named Sunetta,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span><br/>

    a course-setter,<br/>

    who was free from all lustful passions.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now <span class="f2 g"><b>[68]</b></span> he had many hundreds of disciples,<br/>

    to whom he taught the doctrine of fellowship in Brahma's world.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And all they who grasped the word taught by Sunetta,<br/>

    in its fullness,<br/>

    on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>

    were reborn in the realm of bliss,<br/>

    the Brahma-world.</p>

    <p class="f4">But of those who did not grasp the word in full,<br/>

    some, after death,<br/>

    were reborn into the fellowship of the devas<br/>

    who have power over others' creations,<br/>

    some among the devas who delight in creating,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a></sup></span><br/>

    some among the Tusita devas,<br/>

    some among the Yama devas,<br/>

    some among the devas of the Thirty,<br/>

    some in the company of the Four Royal devas,<br/>

    some among wealthy nobles,<br/>

    some among wealthy brahmans<br/>

    and some among wealthy householders.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Sunetta, the teacher, thought thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is not seemly<br/>

    that I should have precisely the same mode of existence<br/>

    as my disciples after death.</p>

    <p class="f4">What if I were to make amity<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a></sup></span> become<br/>

    to a perfect degree!"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And Sunetta, the teacher,<br/>

    cultivated the thought of amity<br/>

    for seven years,<br/>

    and then for seven world-cycles<br/>

    returned not to this world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then when the world rolled on, he arose in the sphere of Radiance;<br/>

    then when the world rolled back,<br/>

    he arose in Brahmā's empty palace.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, he became Brahmā,<br/>

    the conqueror,<br/>

    unconquered,<br/>

    all-seeing,<br/>

    all-powerful.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thirty-six times he was Sakka, the deva-king.</p>

    <p class="f4">Many time seven he was a Wheel-turning rajah,<br/>

    just,<br/>

    righteous,<br/>

    conquering the fur ends of the earth,<br/>

    bringing stability to the country,<br/>

    possessing the seven gems.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet, monks,<br/>

    although Sunetta lived so long<br/>

    and lasted such a time,<br/>

    he was not freed from birth,<br/>

    old age and death,<br/>

    from weeping and lamentation,<br/>

    from pain,<br/>

    grief<br/>

    and tribulation.</p>

    <p class="f4">He was not freed from ill, I say.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is the reason?</p>

    <p class="f4">It was by not being awake to,<br/>

    by not penetrating four conditions.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, it was by not being awake to,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a></sup></span> by not penetrating <span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span> Ariyan right conduct;<br/>

    it was by not being awake to,<br/>

    by not penetrating Ariyan concentration;<br/>

    it was by not being awake to,<br/>

    by not penetrating Ariyan wisdom;<br/>

    and it was by not being awake to,<br/>

    by not penetrating Ariyan release.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, it is just this:</p>

    <p class="f4">when Ariyan right conduct<br/>

    is awakened<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a></sup></span> and penetrated,<br/>

    is awakened and penetrated,<br/>

    when Ariyan wisdom<br/>

    is awakened and penetrated,<br/>

    and when Ariyan release<br/>

    is awakened and penetrated,<br/>

    the craving for life is cut off,<br/>

    the cord<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a></sup></span> that binds one to becoming<br/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And when the Wellfarer had so spoken, the Teacher spoke again, and said:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a></sup></span></p>
