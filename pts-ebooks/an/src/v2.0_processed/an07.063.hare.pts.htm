    17th/18th Century Indian Cuirass</p>

    <p>A cuirass is a piece of armour, formed of a single or multiple pieces of metal or other rigid material, which covers the front of the torso.<br/>

    <span class="f2">— Wikipedia</span><br/>

    c 500 BC India use of body armor was rare because of the heat and where used would likely have been iron, likely chain-mail sometimes with ornamental gold and jewels or even made of silk (which apparently worked somewhat like kevlar to prevent penetration of arrows).</p>
