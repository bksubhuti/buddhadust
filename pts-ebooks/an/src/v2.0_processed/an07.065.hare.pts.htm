    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    the Koviḷāra Pāri-c-chattaka,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of the devas of the Thirty is sere in leaf,<br/>

    <p class="f4">What time the Koviḷāra Pāri-c-chattaka, Tree of the devas of the Thirty<br/>

    those devas sport for four divine months<br/>

    at the foot of the Celestial Tree,<br/>

    dallying and indulging in the five pleasures of the senses.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When the Celestial Tree is in full bloom,<br/>

    its effulgence pervades full fifty leagues.</p>

    <p class="f4">The perfume is blown before the wind a hundred leagues.</p>
