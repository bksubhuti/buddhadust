    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Long ago, monks, there was a teacher named Wheel-Wright,<br/>

    a course-setter,<br/>

    freed of all lustful passions,<br/>

    and he had many hundreds of disciples.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now this was the doctrine that he taught his disciples:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Short is the life of man, O brāhman,<br/>

    insignificant,<br/>

    trifling,<br/>

    fraught with much ill,<br/>

    with much trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the born there is no immortality.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as a drop of dew<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    on the tip of a blade of grass,<br/>

    when the sun gets up,<br/>

    straightway dries up and lasts not a while;<br/>

    even so, brāhman,<br/>

    like a dew-drop is the life of man,<br/>

    insignificant,<br/>

    trifling,<br/>

    fraught with much ill,<br/>

    with much trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4">By mantras awaken (the people)!</p>

    <p class="f4">Do good!</p>

    <p class="f4">Live the godly life!</p>

    <p class="f4">For the born there is no immortality.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as a bubble<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> appears on the water<br/>

    when the sky-deva rains down big drops,<br/>

    but straightway bursts<br/>

    and lasts not a while;<br/>

    even so, brāhman,<br/>

    like a water-bubble<br/>

    is the life of man,<br/>

    insignificant,<br/>

    trifling,<br/>

    fraught with much ill,<br/>

    even so, brāhman,<br/>

    or for an instant<br/>

    or for a second pauses,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>

    but rushes on,<br/>

    swirls along<br/>

    and sweeps forward;<br/>

    even so, brāhman,<br/>

    like a mountain river<br/>

    is the life of man,<br/>

    insignificant,<br/>

    trifling,<br/>

    fraught with much ill,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Just as a strong man<br/>

    might fashion a gob<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> of spittle<br/>

    on the tip of his tongue<br/>

    and spit it out<br/>

    with utmost ease;<br/>

    even so, brāhman,<br/>

    even so, brāhman,<br/>

    like a doomed cow<br/>

    is the life of man,<br/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time, monks,<br/>

    the span of man's life<br/>

    was sixty thousand years<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/>

    and at five hundred years<br/>

    girls were ripe to wed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then man had but six afflictions,<br/>

    to wit:<br/>

    cold and heat,<br/>

    hunger and thirst,<br/>

    and twofold excrement.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet though such was the longevity,<br/>

    such the duration<br/>

    and such the freedom from affliction of the people,<br/>

    the teacher, Wheel-Wright,<br/>

    taught<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span> this doctrine to his disciples:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Short is the life of man, O brāhman,<br/>

    insignificant,<br/>

    trifling,<br/>

    fraught with much ill,<br/>

    with much trouble."</p>

    <p class="f4">By mantras awaken (the people)!</p>

    <p class="f4">Do good!</p>

    <p class="f4">Live the godly life!</p>

    <p class="f4">For the born there is no immortality.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And now, monks,<br/>

    if a man would speak truly,<br/>

    he should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Short is the life of man,<br/>

    insignificant,<br/>

    trifling,<br/>

    fraught with much ill,<br/>

    with much trouble."</p>

    <p class="f4">By wisdom<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span> awaken (the people)!</p>

    <p class="f4">Do good!</p>

    <p class="f4">Live the godly life!</p>

    <p class="f4">For the born there is no immortality.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">For today, monks,<br/>

    he who lives long<br/>

    lives but a hundred years<br/>

    or a little more.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And though a man live a hundred years,<br/>

    he lives but three hundred seasons -<br/>

    a hundred seasons of winter,<br/>

    a hundred seasons of summer<br/>

    and a hundred seasons of rain.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And though he live three hundred seasons,<br/>

    he lives but twelve hundred months -<br/>

    four hundred months of winter,<br/>

    four hundred months of summer<br/>

    and four hundred months of rain.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span> And though he live twelve hundred months,<br/>

    he lives but four and twenty hundred fortnights -<br/>

    eight hundred fortnights of winter,<br/>

    eight hundred fortnights of summer<br/>

    and eight hundred fortnights of rain.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And though he live four and twenty hundred fortnights,<br/>

    he lives but six and thirty thousand days<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span> -<br/>

    twelve thousand days of winter,<br/>

    twelve thousand days of summer<br/>

    and twelve thousand days of rain.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And though he live six and thirty thousand days,<br/>

    he eats but two and seventy thousand meals -<br/>

    four and twenty thousand meals in winter,<br/>

    four and twenty thousand meals in summer<br/>

    and four and twenty thousand meals in the rainy season.</p>

    <p class="f4">This includes mother's milk<br/>

    and foodless times.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Here by foodless times is meant:<br/>

    Agitated, he eats no food;<br/>

    grieved, he eats no food;<br/>

    ill, he eats no food;<br/>

    fasting, he eats no food;<br/>

    and not getting any, he eats no food.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, I account the life<br/>

    of man who lives a hundred years,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span><br/>

    his life-span,<br/>

    the seasons,<br/>

    the years,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a></sup></span><br/>

    the months,<br/>

    the fortnights,<br/>

    the days,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a></sup></span><br/>

    the days and nights,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a></sup></span><br/>
