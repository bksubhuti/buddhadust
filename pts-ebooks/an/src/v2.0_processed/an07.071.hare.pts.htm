    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of seven qualities, a monk is skilled in the discipline.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of wbat seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">He knows what is an offence;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he knows what is not;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he knows what is a trifling offence;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he knows what is a grave one;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he is virtuous,<br/>

    he abides restrained by the restraint of the obligations,<br/>

    perfect in behaviour and conduct,<br/>

    seeing danger in the smallest fault,<br/>

    accepting the training,<br/>

    he trains himself accordantly;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">at will, easily and without trouble,<br/>

    he attains to the four musings,<br/>

    wholly mental,<br/>

    bringing comfort both here and now;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">by destroying the cankers,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart and wisdom,<br/>

    which is cankerless,<br/>

    and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br/>

    even in this life.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, possessed of these seven qualities,<br/>

    a monk is skilled in the discipline.'</p>

    <p>Childers': <i>Āpatti:</i> Offence, guilt, sin, crime. ... appears sometimes to be used adjectively in the sense of "guilty," e.g. <i>yo pabbājeyya āpatti dukkaṭassa,</i> "he who shall ordain such a one shall be guilty of <i>dukkaṭa</i>" ... and <i>anāpatti bhikkhu pārājikassa āpatti dukkaṭassa,</i> "the priest is not guilty of <i>pārājika,</i> he is guilty of <i>dukkaṭa.</i>" But in both these examples it is perhaps possible to take <i>āpattīi</i> as a noun ("there is the guilt of <i>d.</i>").</p>
