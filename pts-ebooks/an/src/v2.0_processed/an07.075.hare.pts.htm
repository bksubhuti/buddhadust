    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br/>

    and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of seven qualities, a monk, skilled in the discipline, is illustrious.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Of what seven?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He knows what is an offence;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he knows what is not;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he knows what is a trifling offence;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he knows what is a grave one;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he is virtuous,<br/>

    he abides restrained by the restraint of the obligations,<br/>

    perfect in behaviour and conduct,<br/>

    seeing danger in the smallest fault,<br/>

    accepting the training,<br/>

    he trains himself accordantly;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">at will, easily and without trouble,<br/>

    he attains to the four musings,<br/>

    wholly mental,<br/>

    bringing comfort both here and now;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">by destroying the cankers,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart and wisdom,<br/>

    which is cankerless,<br/>

    and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br/>

    even in this life.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, possessed of seven qualities, a monk, skilled in the discipline, is illustrious.'</p>
