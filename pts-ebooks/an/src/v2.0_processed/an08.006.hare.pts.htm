    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these eight worldly conditions obsess the world;<br/>

    the world revolves round<br/>

    these eight worldly conditions.</p>

    <p class="f4">What eight?</p>

    <p class="f4">Gain and loss,<br/>

    fame and obscurity,<br/>

    blame and praise,<br/>

    contentment and pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, our doctrines have tbeir foundation in the Exalted One,<br/>

    they are guided by the Exalted One,<br/>

    they have the Exalted's One's protection!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed were it for us,<br/>
