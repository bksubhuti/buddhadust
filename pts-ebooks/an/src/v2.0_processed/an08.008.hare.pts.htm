    <h1>The Venerable Uttara</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[162]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[110]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Uttara<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> dwelt near Mahisavatthu,<br/>

    on the Sankheyyaka mountain,<br/>

    in Dhavajalika.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the venerable Uttara addressed the monks. saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Reverend sirs, well it is for a monk to review,<br/>

    from time to time,<br/>

    his own faults;<br/>

    well it is for him to review<br/>

    the faults of another;<br/>

    well it is to review his own attainments;<br/>

    well it is to review another's.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the Royal deva, Vessavana,<br/>

    was on his way from the northern region to the south,<br/>

    on some business <span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span> or other,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    and he heard the venerable Uttara teaching the monks in Dhavajalika:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Reverend sirs, well it is for a monk to review,<br/>

    from time to time,<br/>

    his own faults;<br/>

    well it is for him to review<br/>

    the faults of another;<br/>

    well it is to review his own attainments;<br/>

    well it is to review another's.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then just as a strong man might stretch forth his bended arm<br/>

    or might bend his outstretched arm;<br/>

    even so the Royal deva, Vessavana,<br/>

    disappeared from Dhavajalika<br/>

    and appeared among the devas of the Thirty.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Vessavana approached Sakka, king of the devas, and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Your<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> grace, I would have you know<br/>

    that this venerable Uttara in Dhavajalika,<br/>

    on the Sankheyyaka mountain,<br/>

    near Mahisavatthu,<br/>

    teaches this doctrine:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well it is, from time to time,<br/>

    to review one's own faults;<br/>

    well it is to review another's;<br/>

    well it is to review one's own attainments;<br/>

    well it is to review another's."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then as a strong man might bend<br/>

    and stretch out his arm again,<br/>

    Sakka, king of the devas, disappeared from among the devas of the Thirty<br/>

    and appeared before the venerable Uttara in Dhavajalika,<br/>

    on the Sankheyyaka mountain,<br/>

    near Mahisavatthu.</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>Sakka did not 'sit' he stood. <i>aṭṭhāsi.</i> The Devas, we hear, find this world more than a little distasteful, and when they visit, do not 'sit in it'.</p>
