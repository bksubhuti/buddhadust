    <p class="f4">Monks, if Nanda has occasion to look to the eastern quarter,<br/>

    concentrating his whole attention,<br/>

    he gazes thereat, reflecting:<br/>

    "thus while I look to the eastern quarter,<br/>

    with orderly reflection,<br/>

    not for amusement,<br/>

    for lust,<br/>

    for adornment,<br/>

    for beauty;<br/>

    but to suffice for the sustaining<br/>

    and nourishment of his body,<br/>

    to appease hunger<br/>

    and to aid the practice of the godly life.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He reflects:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In this way I shall crush out the old feelings<br/>

    and not allow any new feelings to arise<br/>

    and I shall continue to dwell<br/>

    in blamelessness and comfort."</p>

    Nanda purges his mind of thoughts that hinder,<br/>

    so, too, during the first watch of the night;<br/>

    during the middle watch<br/>

    he lies <span class="f2 g"><b>[114]</b></span> like a lion on his right side,<br/>

    with foot covering foot,<br/>

    mindful and self-possessed,<br/>

    intent upon the thought of getting up;<br/>

    getting up in the last watch of the night<br/>
