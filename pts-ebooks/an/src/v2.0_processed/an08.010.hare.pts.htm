    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling in Campa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    on the banks, of the Gaggarā lake.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the monks had occasion to reprove a monk for some offence;<br/>

    and that monk, being so reproved,<br/>

    evaded the question by another,<br/>

    turned the issue aside<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    and showed temper,<br/>

    ill-will<br/>

    and sulkiness.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said to them:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Eject<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> this person, monks!</p>

    <p class="f4">Throw out this person, monks!</p>

    <p class="f4">This person ought to be turned away, monks!</p>

    <p class="f4">Why should other people plague you?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[115]</b></span> Herein, monks, the going out,<br/>

    coming in,<br/>

    gazing up,<br/>

    looking around,<br/>

    stretching,<br/>

    bending,<br/>

    bearing of cloak,<br/>

    bowl<br/>

    and robe<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> of that person<br/>

    seems just the same as the monks' of worth -<br/>

    so long as the monks see not his fault.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when they see it,<br/>

    at once they know:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is the very corruption of a recluse,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    the chaff of a recluse,<br/>

    the sweepings of a recluse."</p>

    <p class="f4">Realizing this,<br/>

    they oust him from their midst forthwith.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And why?</p>

    <p class="f4">They say:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let him not corrupt the other monks who are of worth!"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, just as when a barley plot<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> is ready,<br/>

    the corruption of barley,<br/>

    the chaff of barley,<br/>

    the sweepings of barley<br/>

    may appear with root the same<br/>

    as the rest of the barley of worth,<br/>

    with stalk the same,<br/>

    with blade the same -<br/>

    so long as the head does not come forth.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when the head appears,<br/>

    they know at once:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is the very corruption of barley,<br/>

    the chaff of barley,<br/>

    the sweepings of barley."</p>

    <p class="f4">Realizing this,<br/>

    they pull it out,<br/>

    roots and all,<br/>

    and throw it outside the barley plot.</p>

    <p class="f4">And why?</p>

    <p class="f4">They say:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let it not corrupt the barley of worth!"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">In just the same way, monks,<br/>

    some person's going out,<br/>

    coming in,<br/>

    gazing up,<br/>

    looking around,<br/>

    stretching,<br/>

    bending,<br/>

    bearing of cloak,<br/>

    and robe of that person<br/>

    seems just the same as the monks' of worth -<br/>
