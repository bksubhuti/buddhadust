    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>Once the Exalted One was dwelling in the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana, near Vesālī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time a great many Licchavi notables were seated assembled in the Mote Hall;<br/>

    and in many a figure they were speaking in praise of the Buddha,<br/>

    in praise of Dhamma,<br/>

    in praise of the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Sīha, the general, the disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> was seated in that assembly.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thought he:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely that Exalted One must be arahant,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Thus indeed these many notable Licchavis,<br/>

    assembled and seated in their Mote Hall,<br/>

    in many a figure praise the Buddha,<br/>

    praise Dhamma,<br/>

    praise the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now suppose I were to go and see him,<br/>

    the Exalted One,<br/>

    arahant,<br/>

    fully awakened.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Sīha approached the Nigaṇṭha, Nāṭaputa and said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sir,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> I wish to go and see the recluse Gotama.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sīha, how can you,<br/>

    <p class="f4">'Sīha, how can you,<br/>

    <p class="f4">On a third occasion occasion the Licchavi notables were seated assembled in the Mote Hall;<br/>

    and in many a figure they were speaking in praise of the Buddha,<br/>

    in praise of Dhamma,<br/>

    in praise of the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Sīha, the general, the disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, was seated in that assembly.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thought Sīha:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Undoubtedly that Exalted One is arahant,<br/>

    fully awakened,<br/>

    and so these Licchavis assembled and seated in their Mote Hall,<br/>

    in many a figure praise the Buddha,<br/>

    praise Dhamma,<br/>

    praise the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">What can the Nigaṇṭhas do to me,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> whether they are consulted or not?</p>

    <p class="f4">What if I go without the Nigaṇṭhas' leave and see that Exalted One,<br/>

    arahant,<br/>

    fully awakened?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So at noon, Sīha set out from Vesālī<br/>

    with some five hundred chariots<br/>

    to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    going by carriage as far as the ground permitted,<br/>

    and then descending therefrom,<br/>

    entered the Park on foot.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Approaching the Exalted One, he saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, I have heard this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama affirms the theory of inaction,<br/>

    <p class="f4">I presume they report what the Exalted One has said<br/>

    and do not misrepresent the Exalted One by lying.</p>

    <p class="f4">I presume they set forth a doctrine<br/>

    which conforms to Dhamma,<br/>

    and no one, who is a follower of his Dhamma,<br/>

    would incur blame for saying this.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> preached a graduated discourse<br/>

    to Sīha, the general,<br/>

    that is to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">on almsgiving,<br/>

    the precepts<br/>

    and on heaven.</p>

    <p class="f4">He set forth the peril,<br/>

    the folly<br/>

    and the depravity<br/>

    of lusts<br/>

    and the blessedness<br/>

    of renunciation.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when the Exalted One knew that the heart of Sīha, the general,<br/>

    was clear,<br/>

    malleable,<br/>

    free from hindrance,<br/>

    uplifted<br/>

    and lucid,<br/>

    then he revealed that teaching of Dhamma<br/>

    which Buddhas alone have won,<br/>

    that is to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">ill,<br/>

    its coming-to-be,<br/>

    its ending<br/>

    and the Way.</p>

    <p><i>dhamma-cakkhuṃ udapādi 'yaṃ kiñci samudaya-dhammaṃ sabbantaṃ nirodha-dhammman'</i><br/>

    The Eye of Dhamma arose: 'Whatsoever things arise<br/>

    all those things end.'<br/>

    no 'conditioned by'; 'coming-to-be' is Hare's translation of <i>'samudaya',</i> the second truth.</p>
