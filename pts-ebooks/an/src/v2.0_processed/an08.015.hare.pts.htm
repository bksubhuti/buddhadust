    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">2. 'Monks, there are these eight stains.</p>

    <p class="f4">What eight?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, non-repeating is the mantras' stain;<br/>

    not rising<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> is the stain of houses;<br/>

    sluggishness is the stain of beauty;<br/>

    carelessness is the stain of a guard;<br/>

    misconduct is the stain of a woman;<br/>

    stint is the stain in giving;<br/>

    evil and unrighteous states<br/>

    are stains in this world and the next;<br/>

    but there is a greater stain than these,<br/>

    ignorance is the greatest stain.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the eight stains.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">In non-repeating lies the mantras' stain;<br/>

    Not rising, that of homes; and sluggishness<br/>

    Is beauty's stain; a guard's is carelessness;<br/>

    Misconduct is a woman's stain; in gifts<br/>

    The stain is stint. In sooth, all sins are stains<br/>

    Hereafter and on earth. But greater stain<br/>

    Than these is ignorance, the greatest stain.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
