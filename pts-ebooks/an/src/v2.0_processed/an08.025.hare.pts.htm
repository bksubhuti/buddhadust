    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][kuma][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt among the Sakyas in Banyan Tree Park, at Kapilavatthu.</p>

    <p class="f4">There Mahānamā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Sakyan, came and visited him and,<br/>

    after saluting,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">There, addressing the Exalted One, he said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, how<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> becomes a man a lay-disciple?'</p>

    <p class="f4">When, Mahānamā, he has found refuge in the Buddha<br/>

    found refuge in Dhamma,<br/>

    found refuge in the Order,<br/>

    then he is a lay-disciple.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, how is a lay-disciple virtuous?</p>

    <p class="f4">'When, Mahānamā, a lay-disciple abstains from taking life;<br/>

    abstains from taking what is not given him;<br/>

    abstains from lustful and evil indulgences;<br/>

    abstains from lying;<br/>

    and abstains from spirituous intoxicants,<br/>

    the cause of indolence -<br/>

    then a lay-disciple is virtuous.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, how does a lay-disciple help on his own welfare,<br/>

    but not that of another?</p>

    <p class="f4">'When, Mahānamā, he has achieved faith for self,<br/>

    but strives not to compass faith in another;<br/>

    has achieved virtue for self,<br/>

    but strives not to compass virtue in another;<br/>

    has achieved himself renunciation,<br/>

    but strives not to compass renunciation in another;<br/>

    longs himself to see the monks,<br/>

    but strives not for this sight for another;<br/>

    longs himself to hear Saddhamma,<br/>

    but strives not for this hearing for another;<br/>

    is mindful himself of Dhamma he has heard,<br/>

    but strives not that another should be mindful of it;<br/>

    reflects himself upon the meaning of Dhamma he is mindful of,<br/>

    but strives not for another to reflect thereon;<br/>

    when he knows himself both the letter and the spirit of Dhamma<br/>

    and walks in comformity therewith,<br/>

    but strives not for another <span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span> so to walk -<br/>

    then a lay-disciple helps on his own welfare,<br/>

    but not that of another.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'And how, lord, does a lay-disciple help on<br/>

    both his own welfare and the welfare of another?</p>

    <p class="f4">'When indeed, Mahānamā, he has achieved faith for self,<br/>

    and strives to compass faith in another;<br/>

    has achieved virtue for self,<br/>

    and strives to compass virtue in another;<br/>

    has achieved himself renunciation,<br/>

    and strives to compass renunciation in another;<br/>

    longs himself to see the monks,<br/>

    and strives for this sight for another;<br/>

    longs himself to hear Saddhamma,<br/>

    and strives for this hearing for another;<br/>

    is mindful himself of Dhamma he has heard,<br/>

    and strives that another should be mindful of it;<br/>

    reflects himself upon the meaning of Dhamma he is mindful of,<br/>

    and strives for another to reflect thereon;<br/>

    when he knows himself both the letter and the spirit of Dhamma<br/>

    and walks in comformity therewith,<br/>

    and strives for another so to walk -<br/>

    then, Mahānamā, a lay-disciple helps on his own welfare and the welfare of another.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>
