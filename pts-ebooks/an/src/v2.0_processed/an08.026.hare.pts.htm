    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh]</span> Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Rājagaha in Jivaka's Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">There Jivaka Komarabhacca<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came and visited him and,<br/>

    after saluting, sat down at one side.<br/>

    There, addressing the Exalted One, he said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, how becomes a man a lay-disciple?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'When, Jivaka, he has found refuge in the Buddha<br/>

    found refuge in Dhamma,<br/>

    found refuge in the Order,<br/>

    then he is a lay-disciple.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, how is a lay-disciple virtuous?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'When, Jivaka, a lay-disciple abstains from taking life;<br/>

    abstains from taking what is not given him;<br/>

    abstains from lustful and evil indulgences;<br/>

    abstains from lying;<br/>

    and abstains from spirituous intoxicants,<br/>

    the cause of indolence<br/>

    — then a lay-disciple is virtuous.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, how does a lay-disciple<br/>

    help on his own welfare,<br/>

    but not that of another?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'When, Jivaka, he has achieved faith for self,<br/>

    but strives not to compass faith in another;<br/>

    has achieved virtue for self,<br/>

    but strives not to compass virtue in another;<br/>

    has achieved himself renunciation,<br/>

    but strives not to compass renunciation in another;<br/>

    longs himself to see the monks,<br/>

    but strives not for this sight for another;<br/>

    longs himself to hear Saddhamma,<br/>

    but strives not for this hearing for another;<br/>

    is mindful himself of Dhamma he has heard,<br/>

    but strives not that another should be mindful of it;<br/>

    reflects himself upon the meaning<br/>

    of Dhamma he is mindful of,<br/>

    but strives not for another<br/>

    to reflect thereon;<br/>

    when he knows himself both the letter and the spirit of Dhamma<br/>

    and walks in conformity therewith,<br/>

    but strives not for another so to walk<br/>

    — then a lay disciple helps on his own welfare,<br/>

    but not that of another.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'And how, lord, does a lay-disciple<br/>

    help on both his own welfare<br/>

    and the welfare of another?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'When, Jivaka, he has achieved faith for self,<br/>
