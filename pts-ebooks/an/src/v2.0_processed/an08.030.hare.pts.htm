    <h1>The Venerable Anuruddha<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[228]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[154]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Bhaggis,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    on Crocodile Hill<br/>

    at the Deer Park in Bhesakaḷa Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Anuruddha was dwelling <span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span> among the Cetis<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    in the Eastern Bamboo Forest;<br/>

    and there these reflections occurred to him as he dwelt alone and secluded:</p>

    <p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one who wants little,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    this Dhamma is not for one who wants much.</p>

    <p class="f4">This Dhamma is for the contented,<br/>

    not for the discontented.</p>

    <p class="f4">This Dhamma is for the secluded,<br/>

    not for one fond of society.</p>

    <p class="f4">This Dhamma is for the energetic,<br/>

    not for the lazy.</p>

    <p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one who has set up mindfulness,<br/>

    not for the laggard in mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This Dhamma is for the composed,<br/>

    not for the flustered.</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One, knowing these reflections of the venerable Anuruddha,<br/>

    as easily as a strong man might stretch forth and bend back his arm,<br/>

    disappeared from the Deer Park of Bhesakaḷa Grove<br/>

    and appeared before him.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One sat down on the seat which was made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, the Exalted One addressed him thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well done! Well done, Anuruddha!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well have you pondered over the seven thoughts of a great man!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This Dhamma is for the wise,<br/>

    not for the unwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, Anuruddha, do you also ponder over this eighth thought of a great man, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This Dhamma is for the precise<br/>

    and for one who delights in exactness;<br/>

    the venerable Anuruddha uttered these verses:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">He knew my (heart's) intent, the Teacher, he<br/>

    The Buddha, taught what is not manifold:<br/>

    From him I, Dhamma having learnt, abode<br/>

    Fain for his teaching, the three Vedas won<br/>

    And done the teaching of the Buddha's word.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span></p>
