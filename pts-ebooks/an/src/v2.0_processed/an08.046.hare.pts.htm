    <h1>The Venerable Anuruddha</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita Park.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Anuruddha had gone apart during the noon-day rest;<br/>

    and there, there came to him<br/>

    a host of lovely fairies,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> who saluted and stood at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus standing, they addressed the venerable one and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Master Anuruddha, we are the fairies of lovely form.</p>

    <p class="f4">In three degrees we wield power and have dominion:</p>

    <p class="f4">We can assume in a trice<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> any colour we desire;<br/>

    we can produce in a trice<br/>

    any sound we desire;<br/>

    we can obtain in a trice<br/>

    any happiness we desire.</p>

    <p class="f4">We, Master Anuruddha, are the fairies of lovely form<br/>

    and in these three degrees we have power and dominion.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Oh that these fairies would become all blue,<br/>

    with blue faces,<br/>

    blue garments<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[176]</b></span> and blue finery!'</p>

    <p class="f4">And those fairies,<br/>

    knowing his thoughts,<br/>

    became all blue,<br/>

    with blue faces,<br/>

    blue garments<br/>

    and blue finery.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he thought:<br/>

    'Oh that these fairies would become all yellow,<br/>

    with yellow faces,<br/>

    yellow garments<br/>

    and blue yellow!'</p>

    <p class="f4">And those fairies,<br/>

    knowing his thoughts,<br/>

    became all yellow,<br/>

    with yellow faces,<br/>

    yellow garments<br/>

    and yellow finery.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he thought:<br/>

    'Oh that these fairies would become all red,<br/>

    with red faces,<br/>

    red garments<br/>

    and red yellow!'</p>

    <p class="f4">And those fairies,<br/>

    knowing his thoughts,<br/>

    became all red,<br/>

    with red faces,<br/>

    red garments<br/>

    and red finery.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he thought:<br/>

    'Oh that these fairies would become all white,<br/>

    with white faces,<br/>

    white garments<br/>

    and white finery!'</p>

    <p class="f4">And those fairies,<br/>

    knowing his thoughts,<br/>

    became all white,<br/>

    with white faces,<br/>

    white garments<br/>

    and white finery.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now some of the fairies sang,<br/>

    some danced<br/>

    and some clapped<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> their hands.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> Just as the five instruments of music,<br/>

    when well attuned,<br/>

    well played<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    and properly struck by the skilled,<br/>

    yield a sound at once sweet and charming,<br/>

    alluring,<br/>

    lovable<br/>

    and bewitching;<br/>

    even so was the music of those fairies,<br/>

    all bedecked,<br/>

    at once sweet and charming,<br/>

    alluring,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> lovable<br/>

    and bewitching.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">But the venerable Anuruddha kept his senses under control.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then thought the fairies:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master Anuruddha is not enjoying this,"<br/>

    and immediately vanished.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">At eventide, the venerable Anuruddha arose from solitude<br/>

    and came where the Exalted One was;<br/>

    and after saluting,<br/>

    he sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/>

    he told the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now I, Lord, had gone apart during the noon-day rest;<br/>

    and there, there came to me<br/>

    a host of lovely fairies,<br/>

    who saluted and stood at one side.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, how many qualities have women,<br/>

    who, on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>

    are reborn among the fairies of lovely form?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Eight qualities have women, Anuruddha,<br/>

    who after death<br/>

    are reborn among the fairies of lovely form.</p>

    <p class="f4">What eight?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Anuruddha, the husband to whom her parents give her,<br/>

    out of love for her,<br/>

    seeking her good,<br/>

    in loving kindness<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span> and fond regard, -<br/>

    she will get up before him,<br/>

    retire after him,<br/>

    be obedient to his wishes,<br/>

    lovely in her ways<br/>

    and gentle in speech.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever is honoured by her husband as mother,<br/>

    father,<br/>

    recluse<br/>

    or godly man,<br/>

    such she reverences,<br/>

    honours,<br/>

    esteems<br/>

    and respects;<br/>

    on their arrival she proffers a seat and water.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever her husband's home industries,<br/>

    whether in wool or cotton,<br/>

    therein she is deft and nimble;<br/>

    gifted with an inquiring turn of mind<br/>

    into all such undertakings,<br/>

    she is able to arrange and carry them out.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Of whatever her husband's household consists -<br/>

    slaves,<br/>

    messengers<br/>

    or workfolk -<br/>

    she knows the work of each<br/>

    by what has been done;<br/>

    she knows their remissness<br/>

    by what has not been done;<br/>

    she knows the strength and the weakness of the sick;<br/>

    she divides the hard and soft food,<br/>

    each according to his share.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">When her husband brings home money,<br/>

    corn,<br/>

    silver<br/>

    or gold,<br/>

    she keeps it secure by watch and ward;<br/>

    and of it she is no robber,<br/>

    thief,<br/>

    carouser,<br/>

    wastrel.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">She is a lay-disciple,<br/>

    who has found refuge in the Buddha,<br/>

    in Dhamma<br/>

    and in the Order.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">She keeps the precepts,<br/>

    abstaining from taking life,<br/>

    from stealing,<br/>

    from fleshly lusts,<br/>

    from lying,<br/>

    from drinking strong drink,<br/>

    the cause of sloth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">She is charitable,<br/>

    dwelling at home with heart purged of the stain of stinginess;<br/>

    given over to charity,<br/>

    open-handed,<br/>

    taking delight in giving,<br/>

    yoke-mate to asking,<br/>

    she finds joy in almsgiving.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">These, Anuruddha, are the eight qualities women have,<br/>

    who, after death, are reborn among the fairies of lovely form.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Active, alert to cherish him alway,<br/>

    Not to that man who brings her every joy<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>

    She offers slight, nor will a good wife move<br/>

    To wrath her husband by some spiteful word;<br/>

    And she reveres all whom her lord doth honour -<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span> For she is wise. Deft, nimble, up betimes,<br/>

    She minds his wealth amid his folk at work<br/>

    And sweetly orders all. A wife like this,<br/>

    Who with her husband's wish and will complies,<br/>

    Is born again where lovely devas dwell.'</p>
