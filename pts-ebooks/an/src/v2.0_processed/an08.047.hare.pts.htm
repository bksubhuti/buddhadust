    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in Eastern Park<br/>

    at the terraced house of Migāra's mother.</p>

    <p class="f4">There Visākhā, the mother of Migāra, visited him and saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then The Exalted One addressed her and said:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Eight qualities have women, Visākhe,<br/>

    who after death<br/>

    are reborn among the fairies of lovely form.</p>

    <p class="f4">What eight?</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Visākhe, the husband to whom her parents give her,<br/>

    out of love for her,<br/>

    seeking her good,<br/>

    in loving kindness<br/>

    and fond regard, -<br/>

    she will get up before him,<br/>

    retire after him,<br/>

    be obedient to his wishes,<br/>

    lovely in her ways<br/>

    and gentle in speech.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever is honoured by her husband as mother,<br/>

    father,<br/>

    recluse<br/>

    or godly man,<br/>

    such she reverences,<br/>

    honours,<br/>

    esteems<br/>

    and respects;<br/>

    on their arrival she proffers a seat and water.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever her husband's home industries,<br/>

    whether in wool or cotton,<br/>

    therein she is deft and nimble;<br/>

    gifted with an inquiring turn of mind<br/>

    into all such undertakings,<br/>

    she is able to arrange and carry them out.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Of whatever her husband's household consists -<br/>

    slaves,<br/>

    messengers<br/>

    or workfolk -<br/>

    she knows the work of each<br/>

    by what has been done;<br/>

    she knows their remissness<br/>

    by what has not been done;<br/>

    she knows the strength and the weakness of the sick;<br/>

    she divides the hard and soft food,<br/>

    each according to his share.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">When her husband brings home money,<br/>

    corn,<br/>

    silver<br/>

    or gold,<br/>

    she keeps it secure by watch and ward;<br/>

    and of it she is no robber,<br/>

    thief,<br/>

    carouser,<br/>

    wastrel.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">She is a lay-disciple,<br/>

    who has found refuge in the Buddha,<br/>

    in Dhamma<br/>

    and in the Order.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">She keeps the precepts,<br/>

    abstaining from taking life,<br/>

    from stealing,<br/>

    from fleshly lusts,<br/>

    from lying,<br/>

    from drinking strong drink,<br/>

    the cause of sloth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">She is charitable,<br/>

    dwelling at home with heart purged of the stain of stinginess;<br/>

    given over to charity,<br/>

    open-handed,<br/>

    taking delight in giving,<br/>

    yoke-mate to asking,<br/>

    she finds joy in almsgiving.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, Visākhe, are the eight qualities women have,<br/>

    who, after death, are reborn among the fairies of lovely form.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Active, alert to cherish him alway,<br/>

    Not to that man who brings her every joy<br/>

    She offers slight, nor will a good wife move<br/>

    To wrath her husband by some spiteful word;<br/>

    And she reveres all whom her lord doth honour -<br/>

    For she is wise. Deft, nimble, up betimes,<br/>

    She minds his wealth amid his folk at work<br/>

    And sweetly orders all. A wife like this,<br/>

    Who with her husband's wish and will complies,<br/>

    Is born again where lovely devas dwell.'</p>
