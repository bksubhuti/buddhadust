    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in Eastern Park<br/>

    at the terraced house of Migāra's mother.</p>

    <p class="f4">There Visākhā, the mother of Migāra, visited him and saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed her and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Endowed with four qualities, Visakha,<br/>

    womenfolk win power in this world;<br/>

    this world is in their grasp.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">With what four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Visakha, a woman is capable at her work;<br/>

    she manages the servants;<br/>

    in her ways she is lovely to her lord;<br/>

    she guards his wealth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Visakha, is a woman capable at her work?</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever her husband's home industries,<br/>

    whether in wool or cotton,<br/>

    therein she is deft and nimble;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    gifted with an <span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span> inquiring turn of mind<br/>

    into all such undertakings,<br/>

    she is able to arrange and carry them out.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way a woman is capable at her work.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how does she manage the servants?</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever her husband's household consists of -<br/>

    slaves,<br/>

    messengers<br/>

    or workfolk -<br/>

    she knows the work of each<br/>

    by what has been done;<br/>

    she knows their remissness<br/>

    by what has not been done;<br/>

    she knows the strength and the weakness of the sick;<br/>

    she divides the hard and soft food,<br/>

    each according to his share.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way she manages the servants.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is she lovely in her ways to her lord?</p>

    <p class="f4">What her lord reckons to be unlovely,<br/>

    that she would not commit<br/>

    for very life's sake.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus she is lovely in her ways to her lord.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how does she guard his wealth?</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever money, corn, silver or gold<br/>

    her husband brings home,<br/>

    she keeps it secure by watch and ward;<br/>

    and of it she is no robber, thief, carouser or wastrel.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way she guards his wealth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Endowed with these four qualities, Visakha,<br/>

    womenfolk win power in this world,<br/>

    this world is in their grasp.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Endowed with four qualities, Visakha,<br/>

    womenfolk win power in the next world,<br/>

    the next world is in their grasp.</p>

    <p class="f4">With what four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Visakha, a woman is accomplished in faith,<br/>

    virtue,<br/>

    charity<br/>

    and wisdom.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in faith?</p>

    <p class="f4">She has faith and believes in the awakening of the Tathāgata, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Of a truth he is the Exalted One, arahant, fully awake, abounding in wisdom and righteousness,<br/>

    the well-farer, world-knower,<br/>

    incomparable tamer of tamable men,<br/>

    teacher,<br/>

    the awakened of devas and men,<br/>

    the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is her faith.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in virtue?</p>

    <p class="f4">She abstains from taking life,<br/>

    from stealing,<br/>

    from the lusts of the flesh,<br/>

    from lying<br/>

    and from drinking liquor,<br/>

    the cause of sloth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is her virtue.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in charity?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span> She dwells at bome with heart purged of the stain of avarice,<br/>

    given over to charity,<br/>

    open-handed,<br/>

    delighting in giving,<br/>

    yoke-mate to asking,<br/>

    she finds joy in almsgiving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is her charity.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">She is wise<br/>

    and is endowed with wisdom<br/>

    into the way of the rise and fall of things,<br/>

    with Ariyan penetration of the way<br/>

    to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is her wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Endowed with these four qualities, Visakha,<br/>

    womenfolk win power in the next world,<br/>

    the next world is in their grasp.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Deft, capable, she manages amid<br/>

    His folk at work, minding her husband's wealth,<br/>

    Sweet in her ways; and she is virtuous,<br/>

    Believing, kind and bountiful; she clears<br/>

    The onward Way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> to faring well hereafter.<br/>

    They say a woman who is so endowed,<br/>

    And truthful, just. And where these eight unite,<br/>
