    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[185]</b></span></p>

    <p><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, while the Exalted One was staying at the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana near Vesālī,<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda came to him<br/>

    and saluted<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he spoke thus <span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span> to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, how many qualities must a monk have<br/>

    to be considered the spiritual adviser<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of nuns?</p>

    <p class="f4">'A monk, Ānanda, must have eight qualities<br/>

    to be considered the spiritual adviser of nuns.</p>

    <p class="f4">What eight?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, a monk is virtuous<br/>

    and lives restrained<br/>

    by the restraint of the Obligations;<br/>

    he is perfect in conduct and habit,<br/>

    seeing danger in the smallest fault;<br/>

    he undertakes and trains himself in the precepts.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is learned<br/>

    with memory retentive<br/>

    and well stored.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Those tenets,<br/>

    lovely in the beginning,<br/>

    lovely in the middle<br/>

    and lively in the end,<br/>

    which set forth in spirit<br/>

    and in letter<br/>

    the godly life of purity,<br/>

    perfect in its entirety -<br/>

    even those are fully mastered by him,<br/>

    resolved upon,<br/>

    familiarized by speech,<br/>

    pondered over in mind,<br/>

    fully understood in theory<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">To him both Obligations have been properly and fully handed down,<br/>

    sectioned,<br/>

    regulated<br/>

    and resolved into sutta<br/>

    and into detail.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He has a pleasant voice,<br/>

    his enunciation is good,<br/>

    his speech is urbane,<br/>

    distinct,<br/>

    free from hoarseness<br/>

    and informative.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is able to instruct,<br/>

    incite,<br/>

    rouse<br/>

    and gladden the Order of the nuns<br/>

    with religious discourse.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Generally, he is dear to<br/>

    and liked by the nuns.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Previous to his taking this Exalted One<br/>

    as his authority for going forth,<br/>

    for donning the yellow robe,<br/>

    he has been guilty of no serious crime.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He has been ordained twenty years or more.</p>

    <p class="f4">A monk, Ānanda, must have these eight qualities<br/>

    to be considered a spiritual adviser of nuns.'</p>
