    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, 'fear' is a term for the lusts;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    'ill' is a term for the lusts;<br/>

    'disease' is a term for the lusts;<br/>

    <p class="f4">And wherefore, monks, is 'fear' a term for the lusts?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, since whosoever be bound by the passion of impulse,<br/>

    infatuated by the passion of lust,<br/>

    is neither free from fear in this world,<br/>

    nor free from fear in the world to come;<br/>

    therefore 'fear' is a term for the lusts.</p>

    infatuated by the passion of lust,<br/>

    is neither free from bog in this world,<br/>

    therefore 'bog' is a term for the lusts.</p>
