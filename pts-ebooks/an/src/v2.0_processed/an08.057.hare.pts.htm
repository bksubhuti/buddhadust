    <h1>Those Worthy of Offerings (a)</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">2. 'Monks, a monk who is endowed with eight qualities<br/>

    is worthy of offerings,<br/>

    worthy of gifts,<br/>

    worthy of oblations,<br/>

    meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>

    the world's peerless field for merit.</p>

    <p class="f4">What eight?</p>

    <p class="f4">3. Herein a monk is virtuous,<br/>

    he abides restrained by the restraint of the obligations,<br/>

    perfect in behaviour and conduct,<br/>

    seeing danger in the smallest fault,<br/>

    accepting the training,<br/>

    he trains himself accordantly;</p>

    <p class="f4">4. He is learned,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>

    <i>is replete with learning,<br/>

    is a hoard of learning.</i></p>

    <p class="f4"><i>Those doctrines which,<br/>

    lovely at the beginning,<br/>

    lovely in the middle,<br/>

    lovely at the end<br/>

    both in the meaning and the letter of them,<br/>

    which preach the utterly fulfilled,<br/>

    the perfectly purified way of the God-life, -<br/>

    such doctrines are much heard by him,<br/>

    borne in mind,<br/>

    repeated aloud,<br/>

    pondered over<br/>

    and well penetrated by his vision;</i></p>

    <p class="f4">5. He has good friends,<br/>

    companions and intimates;</p>

    <p class="f4">6. He holds right views and is endowed with wisdom;</p>

    <p class="f4">7. He attains at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty to those pleasant states of living, even in this life, the four musings wholly mental;</p>

    <p class="f4">8. He remembers divers past dwellings, that is to say: one birth, two births, or three, or four, or five,<br/>

    or ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty,<br/>

    or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand,<br/>

    or many an age of rolling on,<br/>

    or many an age of rolling back,<br/>

    or many an age of both rolling on and rolling back -<br/>

    such an one I was by name,<br/>

    of such a clan,<br/>

    of such a caste,<br/>

    such was my food,<br/>

    such my experience of weal and woe,<br/>

    such was the end of my life,</p>

    <p class="f4">passing away thence,<br/>

    I arose in such a place.</p>

    <p class="f4">there, such was my name,<br/>

    such my clan,<br/>

    such my caste,<br/>

    such my food,<br/>

    such my experience of weal and woe,<br/>

    such my end,</p>

    <p class="f4">passing away from there,<br/>

    I arose here.</p>

    <p class="f4">thus many a previous dwelling<br/>

    he calls to mind<br/>

    with its circumstances and details;</p>

    <p class="f4">9. He knows by the deva eye,<br/>

    purified and surpassing that of mankind,<br/>

    the course of beings -<br/>

    lowly and exalted,<br/>

    beautiful and ugly,<br/>

    happy and in woe,<br/>

    according to their deeds;</p>

    <p class="f4">And he thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"These worthies were given over to evil practices<br/>

    in act, word and thought,<br/>

    were revilers of the Ariyans,<br/>

    holders of wrong views,<br/>

    men who have acquired this karma<br/>

    from wrong views;<br/>

    and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>

    have arisen in the untoward way,<br/>

    the ill way,<br/>

    the abyss,<br/>

    hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">But these good sirs behaved rightly<br/>

    in act, word and thought,<br/>

    were no revilers of the Ariyans,<br/>

    held right views<br/>

    and have acquired this karma therefrom;<br/>

    and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br/>

    have arisen in the blissful heaven world."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus with the deva-eye<br/>

    purified and surpassing the human eye,<br/>

    he sees and knows beings<br/>

    in course of faring on -<br/>

    beings lowly and exalted,<br/>

    beautiful and ugly,<br/>

    happy and in woe,<br/>

    according to their deeds.</p>

    <p class="f4">10. By destroying the cankers,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart and wisdom,<br/>

    which is cankerless,<br/>

    and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br/>

    even in this life.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, a monk who is endowed with these eight qualities<br/>

    is worthy of offerings,<br/>

    worthy of gifts,<br/>

    worthy of oblations,<br/>

    meet to be reverently saluted,<br/>

    the world's peerless field for merit.'</p>
