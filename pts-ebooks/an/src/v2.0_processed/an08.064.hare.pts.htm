    <div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">

    <p>GS iii, pg.x, on <i>nivāsa:</i> It is good to have a term from one of those <i>abhiññās</i> used at last in its literal meaning. This is 'dwelling(s),' replacing themore usual 'births' or 'lives' in the reminiscence of one's past previous to this life: - <i>pubbe-nivās'ānussati</i> (p. 13, etc.). This apparently curious choice made by the Buddhist teachers has a significance which will not strike a European. What is that?<br/>

    Why the choice of 'dwelling,' when in Pāli we have 'birth,' 'rebirth,' 'live,' 'world'? I see it thus: Consider first the formula (p.13), or its more formal, more usual wording (p. 296): - 'he remembers manifoldly appointed dwellings in thepast.' This is followed by an exposition, careful as to the 'dwelling' being as inmate of a body, a society, a world, extravagant as to length and number, in which 'births' <i>(jātiyo)</i> is freely used. But the very usual word (in later years) for 'lives' and 'worlds,' <i>bhavā,</i> is not used. What may be the explanation? I suggest the following:<br/>

    (i) The formula 'he ... the past' is the <i>original fixed wording,</i> or 'text.'<br/>

    (ii) The exposition, long left to the exponent, became appended, in its odd medley, later.<br/>

    (iii) When (i) was first listed, the word rendered 'dwellings' meant, not merely a house, but a 'nest,' a 'settlement,' an 'ingress' on the other hand, the word <i>jāti</i> did not fit <span class="f2 g"><b>[xi]</b></span> for 'life.' It meant (a) birth on earth, (6) rank in the brahman, (c) happening, (d) a producing or source. Later on, the plural in the sense of 'new lives' became permissible.<br/>

    (iv) The word for 'life' <i>(jīvita)</i> was never used in the plural; the word for 'world' <i>(loka)</i> in the plural is very hard to find till in later Pali. [note: There is one plural in this volume: <i>lokāsu.</i>]<br/>

    (v) The word that came to be used for both 'lives' and 'worlds,' 'becomings' <i>(bhavā),</i> had <i>not so come into use</i> when the exposition (ii) was finally worded.<br/>

    (vi) Original Buddhism taught that man was a wayfarer in many worlds.<br/>

    Hence I come to this: - recollection of the past was of former homes, stations, rests, stages, rather than of 'births' or of 'lives'; hence <i>nivāsā.</i><br/>
