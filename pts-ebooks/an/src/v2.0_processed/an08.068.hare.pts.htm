    <p><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these eight Ariyan practices.</p>

    <p class="f4">What eight?</p>

    <p class="f4">Declaring as seen what has been seen;<br/>

    declaring as heard what has been heard;<br/>

    declaring as felt what has been felt;<br/>

    declaring as understood what has been understood;<br/>

    declaring as not seen what has not been seen;<br/>

    declaring as not heard what has not been heard;<br/>

    declaring as not felt what has not been felt;<br/>

    declaring as not understood what has not been understood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the eight Ariyan practices."</p>
