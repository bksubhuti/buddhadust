    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>Once the Exalted One dwelt near Vesālī, at the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana.</p>

    taking bowl and cloak,<br/>

    entered Vesālī for alms.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when he had returned from his alms-round in Vesālī,<br/>

    after his meal,<br/>

    he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Take up the mat, Ānanda,<br/>

    we will go to the Cāpāla shrine<br/>

    for the noon-day rest."</p>

    and when he had come there,<br/>

    he sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now after he was seated,<br/>

    he addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī;<br/>

    what time the great winds blow,<br/>

    possessed of psychic powers and mind-mastery,<br/>

    or a deva of great magic power and might,<br/>

    causes the earth to shake,<br/>

    to tremble and to quake<br/>

    when the thought of the earth as limited,<br/>

    or the thought of the waters as limitless,<br/>

    is made become by such an one.</p>

    the second reason,<br/>

    of a great earthquake becoming manifest.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, when a being awakening quits the Tusita assembly<br/>

    and enters, mindful and self-possessed,<br/>

    his mother's womb;<br/>

    then this earth shakes,<br/>

    trembles and quakes.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the third cause,<br/>

    the third reason,<br/>

    of a great earthquake becoming manifest.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">When a being awakening,<br/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This sutta (with some variations) recurs at <i>D.</i> ii, 102; <i>S.</i> v, 259; <i>Ud.</i> 62. See the full notes given at <i>K.S.</i> v, 230 <i>f.,</i> and <i>Dial.</i> ii, 140 <i>f.</i> The <i>Comy.</i> here is much the same as at <i>Ud.A.</i> 322.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> I follow <i>K.S., loc. cit; Dial.</i> 'for an aeon,' which <i>kappa,</i> when used of time, generally means. But tradition, as known to the Commentators, seems to have passed on the meaning as life-span, <i>manussānaṃ āyuppamanaṃ.</i> This expression is used in the text above (p. 93), where the Buddha observes that 'now he who lives long, lives but a hundred years or a tittle more.' The Buddha died at about eighty. Tradition would probably have accepted the usual meaning of <i>kappa</i> had there been any doubt.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> It is a little curious that at <i>A.</i> iv, 278 (above, p. 184) the Buddha tells Ānanda that if women had not been allowed to go forth (because of his importunity they were so allowed) Dhamma would have lasted a long time; yet directly after attaining Buddhahood (<i>paṭhamābhi-sambuddho,</i> <i>D., loc. cit.</i>) he knew that his Order would include nuns.</p>

Fa Hsien relates there was a great pagoda on each of these four sites - that is about the fifth century A.D. (see Giles' <i>trsl.</i> 56).
