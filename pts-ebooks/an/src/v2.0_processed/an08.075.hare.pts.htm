    <p><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these eight achievements.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">What eight?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Achievement in alertness,<br/>

    in wariness,<br/>

    good company,<br/>

    an even life,<br/>

    achievement in faith,<br/>

    in virtue,<br/>

    in charity<br/>

    and in wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the eight achievements.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Up and alert about his task and toil,<br/>

    A careful man, he minds his wealth and lives<br/>

    The even life; and he is virtuous,<br/>

    Believing, kind and bountiful; he clears<br/>

    The onward Way to faring well hereafter.<br/>

    Thus for the believing home-seeker eight states<br/>

    Have been declared by him whose name is Truth'<br/>

    As leading unto happiness both here and then,<br/>

    To bliss hereafter and to welfare now.<br/>

    This is the standard for a householder,<br/>

    For merit grows by generosity.'</p>
