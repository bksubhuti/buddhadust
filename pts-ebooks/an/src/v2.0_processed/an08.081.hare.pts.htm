    The Pali:<br/>

    <i>Satisampajaññe bhikkhave,<br/>

    sati sati-sampajañña-sampannassa upanissampannaṃ hoti hirottappaṃ.</i><br/>

    Bodhi:<br/>

    <i>When there is mindfulness and clear comprehension,<br/>

    for one possessing mindfulness and clear comprehension,<br/>

    the sense of moral shame and moral dread possess their proximate cause.</i><br/>

    <i>Remembering to pay attention to memory, beggars,<br/>

    possession of attention to memory establishes sense of shame/fear of blame.</i></p>
