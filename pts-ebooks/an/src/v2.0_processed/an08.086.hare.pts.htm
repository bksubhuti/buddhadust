    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span></p>

    <p><span class="f3">[1][olds]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One,<br/>

    while wandering for alms<br/>

    with a great company of monks<br/>

    among the Kosalese,<br/>

    came to the brāhman <span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span> village called Icchānaṇgala,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    belonging to them.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there he dwelt in Icchānaṇgala, Wood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the brahman householders of Icchānaṇgala heard the news:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Tis said Master Gotama, the Sakya,<br/>

    a wanderer from out the Sakyan clan,<br/>

    has arrived at Icchānaṇgala,<br/>

    and dwells in the Wood near by.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of that same Master Gotama,<br/>

    this good repute is noised abroad:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He is the Exalted One,<br/>

    arahant,<br/>

    the perfect Buddha,<br/>

    adept in knowledge and conduct,<br/>

    well going,<br/>

    a world-knower,<br/>

    incomparable<br/>

    a tamer of tamable men,<br/>

    among devas and men the teacher,<br/>

    Buddha,<br/>

    Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed it is to see such arahants!'"</p>

    <p class="f4">So at the end of that night,<br/>

    the brahman householders of Icchānaṇgala,<br/>

    taking with them much hard and soft food,<br/>

    went to Icchānaṇgala, Wood<br/>

    and waited outside the gateway,<br/>

    making there a great din and uproar.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Nāgita<br/>

    was the personal attendant of the Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One called the venerable Nāgita<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Who are these, Nāgita<br/>

    that make this great din and uproar?</p>

    <p class="f4">As fisher-folk, methinks,<br/>

    with a great haul of fish!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, these are the Icchānaṇgala, brahman householders,<br/>

    who wait outside the gateway.</p>

    <p class="f4">They have brought much hard and soft food<br/>

    for the use of the Exalted One<br/>

    and the monks of the Order."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have naught to do with homage, Nāgita,<br/>

    nor has homage aught to do with me.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty<br/>

    this happiness of renunciation,<br/>

    this happiness of seclusion,<br/>

    this happiness of calm,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[225]</b></span> this happiness of awakening,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty;<br/>

    let him enjoy that midden<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> of happiness,<br/>

    that dung-like happiness,<br/>

    that happiness gotten of gains,<br/>

    favours<br/>

    and flattery."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, let the Exalted One accept (their offering);<br/>

    let the Well-farer accept;<br/>

    now, lord, is the time for the Blessed One to accept!</p>

    <p class="f4">For wheresoever the Exalted One shall now go,<br/>

    the brahman householders<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

    of town and country<br/>

    will be just like inclined (to give).</p>

    <p class="f4">Lord, just as when the sky-deva rains big drops,<br/>

    the water flows with the slope (of the ground);<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    even so, lord, wheresoever the Exalted One shall now go,<br/>

    the brahman householders of town and country<br/>

    will be bent on (making offerings).</p>

    <p class="f4">And why is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is, lord, because of the virtue,<br/>

    wisdom<br/>

    and knowledge<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> of the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have naught to do with homage, Nāgita,<br/>

    nor has homage imght to do with me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br/>

    let him enjoy that midden of happiness,<br/>

    that dung-like happiness,<br/>

    that happiness gotten of gains,<br/>

    favours<br/>

    and flattery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Some devas, Nāgita,<br/>

    cannot obtain at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty<br/>

    this happiness of renunciation,<br/>

    this happiness of seclusion,<br/>

    this happiness of calm,<br/>

    this happiness of awakening,<br/>

    which I can obtain at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nāgita, when you are assembled and met together<br/>

    and live enjoying company,<br/>

    I think thus:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely, these worthies cannot obtain at will,<br/>

    which I can obtain at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty;<br/>

    so these worthies meet and come together<br/>

    and live enjoying company.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Or else I see monks joking<br/>

    and making merry by poking<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> one another with their fingers.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I think:</p>

    this happiness of calm,<br/>

    this happiness of awakening,<br/>

    which I can obtain at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty;<br/>

    since they joke and make merry<br/>

    by poking one another with their fingers.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Or else I see monks,<br/>

    after eating as much as their bellies will hold,<br/>

    giving themselves over to the delight of bed,<br/>

    to the delight of languor<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>

    and to the delight of torpor.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely, these worthies cannot obtain at will,<br/>

    which I can obtain at will,<br/>

    so they cram their bellies to the uttermost<br/>

    and give themselves over to the delight of bed,<br/>

    languor<br/>

    and torpor.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Or I see a monk living on the outskirts of some village,<br/>

    seated and composed,<br/>

    and I think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Some park-servant or novice will presently disturb<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> this reverend sir<br/>

    and will oust him from that concentration.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So I am not pleased, Nāgita,<br/>

    with that monk's abode,<br/>

    lying on the outskirts of a village.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I see a forest-dwelling monk,<br/>

    seated nodding<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> in a forest,<br/>

    and then I think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Presently, when this reverend sir has got rid of this sleepiness,<br/>

    this lethargy,<br/>

    he will surely ponder on loneliness,<br/>

    making the forest his mark.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">So I am pleased, Nāgita,<br/>

    by that monk's forest abode.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or I see a forest-dwelling monk,<br/>

    seated uncomposed in a forest,<br/>

    and I think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Presently, this reverend sir<br/>

    will compose his uncomposed mind,<br/>

    or will preserve a composed state of mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So I am pleased, Nāgita,<br/>

    with that monk's forest abode.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or I see, Nāgita,<br/>

    a forest-dwelling monk,<br/>

    seated composed in a forest,<br/>

    and I think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Presently, this reverend sir<br/>

    will free the unfreed mind,<br/>

    or will preserve a state of mind,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[227]</b></span> which is free.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So I am pleased, Nāgita,<br/>

    with that monk's forest abode.</p>

    <p class="f4">What time, Nāgita,<br/>

    I reach the high road<br/>

    and see no one either in front or behind me,<br/>

    I have leisure<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> even for calls of nature.'</p>
