    <p>(<i>S.B.E.</i> xx, 120),: 'There are eight things, O Bhikkhus, which when they characterise an Upâsaka, the bowl is to be turned down in respect of him;--when he goes about to bring loss of gifts on the Bhikkhus, when he goes about to bring harm to the Bhikkhus, when he goes about to cause the Bhikkhus to want a place of residence, when he reviles or slanders the Bhikkhus, when he causes divisions between Bhikkhus and Bhikkhus;--when he speaks in dispraise of the Buddha,;--when he speaks in dispraise of the Dhamma;--when he speaks in dispraise of the Samgha. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to turn down the bowl in respect of an Upâsaka who is characterised by these eight things.'<br/>

    and also:<br/>

    When a Bhikkhu behaves towards the laity in any one of the first five of these eight ways the Patisâraniya-kamma is to be carried out against him--that is to say, he has to ask pardon of the layman against whom he has offended.</p>
