    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, the Order, should it wish,<br/>

    may hold proceedings for the expiation<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of the offence committed by a monk,<br/>

    who is possessed of eight qualities.</p>

    <p class="f4">What eight?</p>

    <p class="f4">He goes about to bring loss to householders;<br/>

    he goes about to bring harm to householders;<br/>

    he reviles and defames them;<br/>

    he causes disunion between householder and householder;<br/>

    of Dhamma,<br/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Paṭisāraṇīya-kammaṃ;</i> this is the name of the punishment of a monk, who has offended a layman; see, <i>Child. s.v.,</i> <i>Vin.</i> ii, 19; <i>G.S.</i> i, 84.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Na saccāpeti.</i> <i>P.E.D.</i> considers this a misreading for <i>sajjāpeti</i> meaning to undertake, fulfil, realize. The word recurs at <i>Vin.</i> ii, <i>loc. cit.</i> <i>Comy.</i> here glosses: <i>visaṇvādeti:</i> to deceive; <i>cf.</i> the story of the deception of Upananda at <i>Vin.</i> i, 153 <i>f.</i> I suggest it is simply the denominative verb of <i>sacca.</i></p>
