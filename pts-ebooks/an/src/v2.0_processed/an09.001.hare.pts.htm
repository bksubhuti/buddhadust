    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][upal]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying: "Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"If, monks, wanderers of other views should question you thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'For conditious that wing to the awakening,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    what, reverend sirs, is the thing<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to make become?'</p>

    <p class="f4">How would you, thus questioned, reply to those wanderers?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, our ideas have their foundation in the Exalted One;<br/>

    they are guided by the Exalted One<br/>

    and are protected by him!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed were it for us,<br/>

    if the Exalted One were to make clear the essence of this matter;<br/>

    then, on hearing it,<br/>

    the monks would bear it in mind!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Wherefore, monks, listen, pay heed, I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"If, monks, wanderers of other views should question you thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'For conditions that wing to the awakening,<br/>

    what, <span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span> reverend sirs, is the thing to make become?'</p>

    <p class="f4">- you should, so questioned, reply to them:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Herein, reverend sirs, a monk has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the first thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Again, sirs, a monk is virtuous and dwells restrained by the restraint of the Obligations;<br/>

    he is perfect in behaviour and habitude,<br/>

    seeing danger in the smallest fault;<br/>

    undertaking the training,<br/>

    he trains himself accordantly.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This is the second thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Then, sirs, that talk which is serious and a help to opening the heart -<br/>

    that is to say,<br/>

    talk on wanting little,<br/>

    on contentment,<br/>

    on loneliness,<br/>

    on going apart,<br/>

    on strenuous endeavour,<br/>

    on virtue,<br/>

    on concentration,<br/>

    on wisdom,<br/>

    on emancipation,<br/>

    on the knowledge and vision of emancipation<br/>

    - a monk obtains at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This is the third thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Then, sirs, a monk dwells strenuous in purpose,<br/>

    putting away unrighteous conditions,<br/>

    taking to righteousness;<br/>

    persevering and energetic,<br/>

    he shirks not the burden of righteousness.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This is the fourth thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Moreover, sirs, a monk has wisdom<br/>

    and is endowed therewith<br/>

    with Ariyan penetration<br/>

    concerning the way to the utter destruction of ill.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this may be expected of a monk,<br/>
