    <h1>The Venerable Meghiya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[234]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][upal]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, when the venerable Meghiya was his attendant,<br/>

    the Exalted One<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> stayed at Calika,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> on the hill there.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Meghiya approached the Exalted One,<br/>

    saluted him<br/>

    and stood at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So standing, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, I would like to visit Jantugāma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> for alms."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do now, Meghiya, as you think timely."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So the venerable Meghiya,<br/>

    dressing himself before noon,<br/>

    taking bowl and robe,<br/>

    entered Jantugāma for alms.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when he had wandered about for alms<br/>

    and returned therefrom<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[235]</b></span> and finished his meal,<br/>

    he came to the bank of the Kimikaḷa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> river.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, while stretching his legs<br/>

    and roaming to and fro<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> along the river bank,<br/>

    the venerable Meghiya saw a mango grove,<br/>

    pleasing and beautiful;<br/>

    and at the sight, he thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Truly, this mango grove is pleasing and beautiful;<br/>

    meet, indeed, is it to strive here,<br/>

    for a clansman wanting to strive!</p>

    <p class="f4">If the Exalted One permit me,<br/>

    I will come and strive in this mango grove."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Meghiya returned to the Exalted One,<br/>

    saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side<br/>

    and (told him all that had taken place, adding):</p>

    <p class="f4">"If the Exalted One permit me,<br/>

    I will go to that mango grove and strive."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Stay awhile, Meghiya,<br/>

    till some other monk appear,<br/>

    for we are alone."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">A second time the venerable Meghiya spoke, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, for the Exalted One there is nothing further to be done;<br/>

    there is no adding to his accomplishments.</p>

    <p class="f4">But for me, lord, there is more to be done;<br/>

    to what is done,<br/>

    there is (more) to be added.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">If the Exalted One permit me,<br/>

    I will go to that mango grove and strive."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Stay awhile, Meghiya,<br/>

    till some other monk appear,<br/>

    for we are alone."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">A third time the venerable Meghiya spoke, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, for the Exalted One there is nothing further to be done;<br/>

    there is no adding to his accomplishments.</p>

    <p class="f4">But for me, lord, there is more to be done;<br/>

    to what is done<br/>

    there is more to be added.</p>

    <p class="f4">If the Exalted One permit me,<br/>

    I will go to the mango grove and strive."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[236]</b></span> 'What can we say to you, Meghiya,<br/>

    when you repeat:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I would strive'?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do now, Meghiya, as you think fit."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Meghiya rose from sitting,<br/>

    saluted the Exalted One,<br/>

    and keeping him on his right,<br/>

    went to the mango grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">And having come,<br/>

    he entered the grove and sat down at the foot of a tree<br/>

    to spend the noon-day rest.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And there, in that mango grove,<br/>

    three wicked, evil thoughts<br/>

    kept coming to the venerable Meghiya -<br/>

    that is to say,<br/>

    sensual thoughts,<br/>

    malign thoughts<br/>

    and cruel thoughts.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Meghiya wondered thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is amazing and astonishing, sir!</p>

    <p class="f4">By<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> faith alone<br/>

    have I gone forth from home<br/>

    to this homeless state;<br/>

    yet I am still dogged<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> by these three wicked, evil thoughts:<br/>

    sensual thoughts,<br/>

    malign thoughts,<br/>

    cruel thoughts."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So the venerable Meghiya returned to the Exalted One,<br/>

    saluted him<br/>

    and stood at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So standing, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, while I stayed in that mango grove,<br/>

    three wicked, evil thoughts kept coming to me:<br/>

    sensual thoughts,<br/>

    malign thoughts<br/>

    and cruel thoughts;<br/>

    and I thought how amazing and astonishing it was<br/>

    that I had gone forth<br/>

    from the home to the homeless life by faith alone;<br/>

    for, lord, I am still dogged by those three wicked, evil thoughts:<br/>

    sensual thoughts,<br/>

    malign thoughts,<br/>

    cruel thoughts."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"For the emancipation of the mind of the unripe,<br/>

    five conditions, Meghiya,<br/>

    are conducive to the ripening.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Meghiya, a monk has a good friend,<br/>

    a good companion,<br/>

    a good comrade.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the emancipation of the mind of the unripe,<br/>

    this is the first condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, a monk is virtuous<br/>

    and dwells restrained by the restraint of the Obligations<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span>

    he is perfect in behaviour and habitude,<br/>

    seeing danger in the smallest fault;<br/>

    undertaking the training,<br/>

    he trains himself accordantly.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the second condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span> Then, Meghiya, that talk which is serious and a help to opening the heart -<br/>

    that is to say,<br/>

    talk on wanting little,<br/>

    on contentment,<br/>

    on loneliness,<br/>

    on going apart,<br/>

    on strenuous endeavour,<br/>

    on virtue,<br/>

    on concentration,<br/>

    on wisdom,<br/>

    on emancipation,<br/>

    on the knowledge and vision of emancipation<br/>

    - a monk obtains at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the third condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Meghiya, a monk dwells strenuous in purpose,<br/>

    putting away unrighteous conditions,<br/>

    taking to righteousness;<br/>

    persevering and energetic,<br/>

    he shirks not the burden of righteousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the fourth thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, Meghiya, a monk has wisdom<br/>

    and is endowed therewith<br/>

    as to the way of growth and decay,<br/>

    with Ariyan penetration<br/>

    concerning the way to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Meghiya, is the fifth condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Meghiya, this may be expected of a monk,<br/>

    who has a good friend,<br/>

    companion, comrade:<br/>

    he will be virtuous,<br/>

    and dwell restrained by the restraint of the Obligations;<br/>

    perfect in behaviour and habitude,<br/>

    seeing danger in the smallest fault;<br/>

    undertaking the training,<br/>

    training himself accordantly.</p>

    on going apart,<br/>

    on strenuous endeavour,<br/>

    on virtue,<br/>

    on concentration,<br/>

    on wisdom,<br/>

    on emancipation,<br/>

    on the knowledge and vision of emancipation<br/>

    - he will obtain at will,<br/>

    easily and without difficulty.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover this may also be expected of a monk,<br/>

    he will dwell strenuous in purpose,<br/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Meghiya, when that monk is established in those five conditions,<br/>

    four more conditions must be made to become,<br/>

    that is to say,<br/>

    (reflection on) foul things<br/>

    must be made to become,<br/>

    to put away passion;<br/>

    (reflection on) amity<br/>

    must be made to become,<br/>

    to put away ill-will;<br/>

    mindfulness in in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>

    must be made to become,<br/>

    to cut off distraction; the thought of impermanence<br/>

    must be made to become,<br/>

    to uproot the conceit 'I am.'</p>
