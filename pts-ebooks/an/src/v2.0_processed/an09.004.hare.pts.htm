    <h1>The Venerable Nandaka</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][upal]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying near <i>Sāvatthī</i>,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/>

    the venerable Nandaka<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> gave Dhamma discourse to the monks in the service hall;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    taught them,<br/>

    roused them,<br/>

    incited them<br/>

    and gladdened them.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now in the evening<br/>

    the Exalted One rose from seclusion<br/>

    and approached the service hall;<br/>

    and having come,<br/>

    he stood outside the doorway,<br/>

    waiting for the discourse to end.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when he knew that the discourse was ended,<br/>

    he coughed and tapped on the bolt.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[238]</b></span> Then those monks opened the door to the Exalted One,<br/>

    and he entered the hall and sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had seated himself,<br/>

    the Exalted One spoke thus to the venerable Nandaka:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely, Nandaka, this Dhamma discourse,<br/>

    which you preached to the monks,<br/>

    was a long one!</p>

    <p class="f4">My back ached as I stood outside the doorway, waiting for the discourse to end."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus spoken,<br/>

    the venerable Nandaka, being embarrassed,<br/>

    said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Nay, lord, we knew not that the Exalted One stood outside the door.</p>

    <p class="f4">Had we known, lord, we would not have said so much."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One knew<br/>

    that the venerable Nandaka was embarrassed,<br/>

    so he said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well done, well done, Nandaka!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is right for you clansmen,<br/>

    who by faith have gone forth from the home to the homeless life,<br/>

    when you may be seated around for Dhamma discourse!</p>

    <p class="f4">For you assembled, Nandaka, there are two courses:<br/>

    either discourse on Dhamma<br/>

    or maintain the Ariyan silence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>The transition here is unusually abrupt. It feels as though there were some introductory remarks left out, as, for example, some reference to what was being taught by Nandaka.</p>
