    <p class="f4">They do not rise up pleasantly;<br/>

    nor greet one pleasantly;<br/>

    though they have choice food, they give coarse food;<br/>

    they give without respect or care;<br/>

    they do not sit round to hear Dhamma;<br/>

    they savour<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> not the spoken word.</p>
