    <h1>Velama<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[262]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][upal][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was dwelling near <i>Sāvatthī</i>,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/>

    the householder, Anāthapiṇḍika, visited him<br/>

    and after saluting sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One addressed Anāthapiṇḍika thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is alms given in your family,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> householder?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord, alms are given, but it consists of a coarse mess of broken rice grains together with sour gruel."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p class="f4">"Householder, whether one give coarse alms or choice,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    then, wheresoever that almsgiving bear fruit,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

    his mind will not turn to <span class="f2 g"><b>[263]</b></span> the enjoyment of excellent food,<br/>

    of fine raiment,<br/>

    of rich carriages,<br/>

    to the enjoyment of the excellencies of the five senses;<br/>

    and one's sons and one's daughters,<br/>

    one's slaves,<br/>

    nor lend an ear,<br/>

    nor bring understanding to bear<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> (on what one says).</p>

    <p class="f4">And wherefore?</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the result, householder,<br/>

    of deeds done casually.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">But whether one give coarse alms or choice, householder,<br/>

    if one give considerately,<br/>

    after taking thought,<br/>

    with one's own hand,<br/>

    give other than orts<br/>

    and with a view to the future;<br/>

    then, wheresoever that almsgiving bear fruit,<br/>

    his mind will turn to the enjoyment of good food,<br/>

    of fine raiment,<br/>

    of rich carriages,<br/>

    of the excellences of the five senses;<br/>

    and one's sons and one's daughters,<br/>

    one's slaves,<br/>

    messengers and workfolk<br/>

    will desire to listen to one,<br/>

    will lend an ear<br/>

    and bring understanding to bear (on what one says).</p>

    <p class="f4">And wherefore?</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the result, householder,<br/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Long ago, householder, there lived a brahman called Velama.</p>

    <p class="f4">He gave very rich gifts, such as these:</p>

    <p class="f4">He gave eighty-four thousand golden bowls,<br/>

    filled with silver;<br/>

    he gave eighty-four thousand silver bowls,<br/>

    filled with gold;<br/>

    he gave eighty-four thousand copper bowls,<br/>

    filled with treasure;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    he gave eighty-four thousand steeds,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>

    with trappings of gold,<br/>

    with banners of gold,<br/>

    covered with nets of gold thread;<br/>

    he gave eighty-four thousand chariots,<br/>

    spread with lion-skins,<br/>

    tiger-skins,<br/>

    leopard-skins,<br/>

    saffron-coloured blankets,<br/>

    with golden trappings,<br/>

    golden banners,<br/>

    covered with nets of gold thread;<br/>

    he gave eighty-four thousand milch kine,<br/>

    with tethers of fine jute,<br/>

    with milk-pails of silver;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>

    he gave eighty-four thousand maidens<br/>

    adorned with jewelled ear-rings;<br/>

    he gave eighty-four thousand <span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span> couches,<br/>

    spread with fleecy covers,<br/>

    white blankets and woollen flower-embroidered coverlets,<br/>

    covered with rugs of antelope skins,<br/>

    with awnings above<br/>

    and crimson cushions at each end<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>

    he gave eighty-four thousand lengths<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> of cloth,<br/>

    of finest flax,<br/>

    of finest silk,<br/>

    of finest wool,<br/>

    of finest cotton.</p>

    <p class="f4">And who shall tell of the food and the drink that he gave,<br/>

    food both hard and soft,<br/>

    sweetmeats and syrups!</p>

    <p class="f4">They flowed, methinks, as rivers!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Perhaps, householder, you may think thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Maybe Velama, the brahman,<br/>

    who made that very rich gift,<br/>

    was someone else.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But think not so,<br/>

    for it was I,<br/>

    who at that time was Velama, the brahman;<br/>

    it was I who made that very rich gift.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">But when that alms was given, householder,<br/>

    there was no one worthy to receive the gift;<br/>

    there was none to sanctify that gift.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">For, though brahman Velama gave that very rich gift,<br/>

    greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

    had he fed one person of right view.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

    or though he fed a hundred persons of right view,<br/>

    greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

    had he fed one Once-returner.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

    or though he fed a hundred Once-returners,<br/>

    greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

    had he fed one Non-returner.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

    or though he fed a hundred Non-returners,<br/>

    greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

    had he fed one Arahant.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

    or though he fed a hundred Arahants,<br/>

    greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

    had he fed one silent Buddha.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

    or though he fed a hundred silent Buddhas,<br/>

    greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

    had he fed one Tathāgata, arahant, fully awake.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

    or though he fed the Order of monks,<br/>

    with the Buddha at their head,<br/>

    greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

    had <span class="f2 g"><b>[265]</b></span> he built a monastery<br/>

    for the use of the monks<br/>

    of the Order of the surrounding country.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

    or though with pious heart<br/>

    he took refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and the Order,<br/>

    greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

    had he with pious heart<br/>

    undertaken to keep the precepts:<br/>

    abstention from taking life,<br/>

    from taking what is not given,<br/>

    from carnal lusts,<br/>

    from lying<br/>

    and from intoxicating liquor,<br/>

    the cause of sloth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

    or though with pious heart<br/>

    he undertook to keep these precepts,<br/>

    greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

    had he made become a mere passing fragrance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span> of amity.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br/>

    or though he made become just the fragrance of amity,<br/>

    greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br/>

    had he made become,<br/>

    just for a finger-snap,<br/>

    the thought of impermanence.'</p>
