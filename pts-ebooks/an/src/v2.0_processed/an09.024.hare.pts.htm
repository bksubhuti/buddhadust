    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying: "Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these nine spheres of beings.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Whiat nine?</p>

    <p class="f4">[<b>1</b>] Monks, there are beings differing in body<br/>

    and differing in perceptive power,<br/>

    as for instance mankind,<br/>

    some devas<br/>

    and some in purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the first sphere of beings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">[<b>2</b>] Monks, there are beings differing in body<br/>

    and similar in perceptive power,<br/>

    as for instance devas of the Brahma world,<br/>

    reborn there after practising the first (musing here).</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the second sphere of beings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">[<b>3</b>] Monks, there are beings similar in body,<br/>

    but differing in perceptive power,<br/>

    as for instance the radiant devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the third sphere of beings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">[<b>4</b>] Monks, there are beings similar in body<br/>

    and similar in perceptive power,<br/>

    as for instance the lustrous devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the fourth sphere of beings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">[<b>5</b>] Monks, there are beings without perceptive power<br/>

    and without feeling,<br/>

    as for instance the unconscious devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the fifth sphere of beings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">[<b>6</b>] Monks, there are beings who,<br/>

    by wholly transcending the perception of form,<br/>

    by the passing away of the perception of the sense-reaction<br/>

    and by turning the attention away from the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>

    attain to the sphere of infinite space, realizing:<br/>

    Space is infinite.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the sixth sphere of beings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">[<b>7</b>] Monks, there are beings who,<br/>

    by having wholly transcended the sphere of infinite space,<br/>

    attain to the sphere of infinite consciousness, realizing:<br/>

    Consciousness is infinite.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the seventh sphere of beings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">[<b>8</b>] Monks, there are beings who,<br/>

    having wholly transcended the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>

    attain to the sphere of nothingness, realizing:<br/>

    There is nothing.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the eighth sphere of beings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">[<b>9</b>] Monks, there are beings who,<br/>

    having wholly transcended the sphere of nothingness,<br/>

    attain to the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ninth sphere of beings.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the nine spheres of beings."</p>
