    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying: "Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, when the mind of a monk is well heaped around with wisdom,<br/>

    it is proper for that monk to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know that birth is destroyed,<br/>

    the godly life lived,<br/>

    done is what was to be done<br/>

    and there is no more life in these conditions.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, is the mind of a monk<br/>

    well heaped around with wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Passion-free is my mind' -<br/>

    (knowing this) is his mind well heaped around with wisdom;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'hatred-free is my mind,' -<br/>

    (knowing this) is his mind well heaped around with wisdom;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'delusion-free is my mind,' -<br/>

    (knowing this) is his mind well heaped around with wisdom;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'free of any passionate condition,' -<br/>

    (knowing this) is his mind well heaped around with wisdom;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'free of any hateful condition,' -<br/>

    (knowing this) is his mind well heaped around with wisdom;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'free of any delusive condition,' -<br/>

    (knowing this) is his mind well heaped around with wisdom;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'my mind is free of any condition<br/>

    of return <span class="f2 g"><b>[271]</b></span> for becoming<br/>

    in (the worlds of) sense, form and no form,' -<br/>

    (knowing this) is his mind well heaped around with wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, when the mind of a monk<br/>

    is well heaped around with wisdom,<br/>

    it is proper for that monk to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know that birth is destroyed,<br/>

    the godly life lived,<br/>

    done is what was to be done<br/>

    and there is no more life in these conditions.'"</p>
