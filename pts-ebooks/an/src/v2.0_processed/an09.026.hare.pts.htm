    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once when the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable Candikāputta<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> were dwelling near Rājagaha<br/>

    in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrel's Feeding Ground,<br/>

    the venerable Candikāputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, Devadatta taught Dhamma to the monks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">His mind is well heaped around with thoughtfulness<br/>
