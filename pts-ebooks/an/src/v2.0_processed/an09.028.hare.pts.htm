    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br/>

    there the Exalted One said this to the Monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"When, monks, for the Ariyan disciple<br/>

    the fivefold dread and hatred has ceased,<br/>

    and he is endowed with the four possessions of the Streamwinner,<br/>

    he may, should he wish,<br/>

    declare the self just by the self:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed for me is hell;<br/>

    destroyed for me is rebirth in the womb of an animal;<br/>

    destroyed for me is the realm of Petas;<br/>

    destroyed for me is the untoward way,<br/>

    the ill way,<br/>

    the abyss.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am a Streamwinner,<br/>

    not subject to any falling back,<br/>

    assured and bound for the awakening."</p>

    <p class="f4">What fivefold dread and hatred has ceased?</p>

    <p class="f4">When, monks, the taker of life,<br/>

    by reason of his taking life,<br/>

    breeds dread and hatred in this world,<br/>

    or when he breeds dread and hatred in the next world,<br/>

    he experiences in the mind<br/>

    pain and grief;<br/>

    but he who abstains from taking life<br/>

    breeds no dread and hatred in this world,<br/>

    breeds no dread and hatred in the next world,<br/>

    nor experiences in the mind<br/>

    pain and grief.</p>
