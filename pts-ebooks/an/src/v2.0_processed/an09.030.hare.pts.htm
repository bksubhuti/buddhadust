    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br/>

    there the Exalted One said this to the Monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these nine ways of dispelling strife.</p>

    <p class="f4">What nine?</p>

    <p class="f4">(The thought):</p>

    <p class="f4">'He has done me harm, but wherein lies the gain to him from this?' - dispells strife;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">so also the thoughts:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He is doing me harm, but wherein lies the gain to him from this?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'he will do me harm, but wherein lies the gain to him from this?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'he has done harm to a dear and loved one of mine, but wherein lies the gain to him from this?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'he is doing harm to such an one, but wherein lies the gain to him from this?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'he will do harm to him, but wherein lies the gain to him from this?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'he has done good to one who is not dear or loved by me, but wherein lies the gain to him from this?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'he is doing good to such an one, but wherein lies the gain to him from this?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'he will do good to him, but wherein lies the gain to him from this?'</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the nine bases of dispelling strife.'</p>
