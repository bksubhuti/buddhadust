    <h1>The Abidings (a)</h1>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[276]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br/>

    there the Exalted One addressed the Monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord" they replied.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[2][than]</span> "Monks, there are these nine gradual abidings.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What nine?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk,<br/>

    aloof from sense desires,<br/>

    aloof from evil ideas,<br/>

    enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>

    wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>

    which is born of solitude<br/>

    and is full of zest and ease.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>

    which is self-evolved,<br/>

    born of concentration,<br/>

    full of zest and ease,<br/>

    free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br/>

    mindful and self-possessed,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>

    and experiences in his being<br/>

    that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">By putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>

    by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>

    which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br/>

    and is free of ease and ill.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br/>

    by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br/>

    unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br/>

    'Space is infinite'.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br/>

    'Consciousness is infinite'.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br/>

    'There is nothing'.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[277]</b></span> Passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the ending of perception and feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the nine gradual abidings.'</p>
