    <h1>The Brahmans</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now two brahmans, skilled in metaphysics,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> visited the Exalted One and,<br/>

    after greeting him and exchanging the usual compliments,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, they said this to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master Gotama, Parana Kassapa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> all-knowing, all-seeing,<br/>

    professes unlimited knowledge and purview:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whether I walk, stand,<br/>

    sleep or wake,<br/>

    always,<br/>

    ever,<br/>

    knowledge and <span class="f2 g"><b>[288]</b></span> purview are present!'</p>

    <p class="f4">And he has thus declared:</p>

    <p class="f4">'With infinite knowledge I abide<br/>

    knowing, seeing a finite<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> world!'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Master Gotama, the Nigantha, Nataputta,<br/>

    all-knowing, all-seeing,<br/>

    also professes unlimited knowledge and purview:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whether I walk, stand,<br/>

    sleep or wake,<br/>

    always,<br/>

    ever,<br/>

    knowledge and purview are present!'</p>

    <p class="f4">But he has thus declared:</p>

    <p class="f4">'With infinite knowledge I abide<br/>

    knowing, seeing an infinite world!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these two talkers on knowledge, Master Gotama,<br/>

    of these two who contradict each other -<br/>

    which of the two speaks the truth,<br/>

    which lies?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough, brahmans!</p>

    <p class="f4">'Of these two talkers on knowledge,<br/>

    of these two who contradict each other -<br/>

    which of the two speaks the truth, which lies?' — Let be!</p>

    <p class="f4">I will teach you Dhamma, brahmans;<br/>

    listen,<br/>

    pay heed,<br/>

    I will speak!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, sir," they rejoined;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Imagine, brahmans, four men standing at the four corners of the world,<br/>

    each endowed with supreme pace and speed,<br/>

    with supreme length of stride -<br/>

    as an<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> archer,<br/>

    mighty with bow,<br/>

    skilled, deft, a marksman,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    may wing with ease<br/>

    a slender shaft across a palm-tree's shadow -<br/>

    let such be their speed;<br/>

    as western sea from eastern sea -<br/>

    such their stride.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now suppose the man standing at the eastern corner were to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'By walking I'll reach the end of the world!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Though man's life-span were a hundred years<br/>

    and he lived a hundred years<br/>

    and walked for a hundred years -<br/>

    save when eating, drinking, chewing, munching,<br/>

    answering nature's calls<br/>

    and dispelling fatigue by sleep<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span>-<br/>

    he would die or ever he reached the end of the world.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And suppose the man at the western corner were to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'By walking I'll reach the end of the world!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Though man's life-span were a hundred years<br/>

    and he lived a hundred years<br/>

    and walked for a hundred years -<br/>

    save when eating, drinking, chewing, munching,<br/>

    answering nature's calls<br/>

    and dispelling fatigue by sleep<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span>-<br/>

    he would die or ever he reached the end of the world.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And suppose the man at the northern corner were to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'By walking I'll reach the end of the world!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Though man's life-span were a hundred years<br/>

    and he lived a hundred years<br/>

    and walked for a hundred years -<br/>

    save when eating, drinking, chewing, munching,<br/>

    answering nature's calls<br/>

    and dispelling fatigue by sleep-<br/>

    he would die or ever he reached the end of the world.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And suppose the man the man at the southern corner were to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'By walking I'll reach the end of the world!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Though man's life-span were a hundred years<br/>

    and he lived a hundred years<br/>

    and walked for a hundred years -<br/>

    save when eating, drinking, chewing, munching,<br/>

    answering nature's calls<br/>

    and dispelling fatigue by sleep-<br/>

    he <span class="f2 g"><b>[289]</b></span> would die or ever he reached the end of the world.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And why?</p>

    <p class="f4">Not, brahmans, by such journeys<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    do I say that the world's end<br/>

    may be known, seen, reached;<br/>

    yet I declare, brahmans,<br/>

    that without reaching the end of the world<br/>

    there is no ending of ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Brahmans, these five strands of sense-desire<br/>

    are called the world<br/>

    in the code of the Ariyan.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span>Shapes, cognized by the eye,<br/>

    enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>
