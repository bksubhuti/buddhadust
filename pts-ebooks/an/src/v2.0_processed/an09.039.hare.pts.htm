    <h1>The Devas</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[290]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One said this to the Monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> long ago a battle raged between the devas and the Asuras,<br/>

    and in that battle the Asuras won<br/>

    and the devas were defeated.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the defeated devas simply fled,<br/>

    with the Asuras facing north hot after them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then thought the devas:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Asuras give chase;<br/>

    let us battle with them a second time!'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time they fought<br/>

    and in that battle the Asuras won<br/>

    and the devas were defeated.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the defeated devas simply fled,<br/>

    with the Asuras facing north hot after them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then thought the devas:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Asuras give chase;<br/>

    let us battle with them a third time!'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time they fought<br/>

    and the Asuras won<br/>

    and the devas were defeated;<br/>

    and defeated and fearful,<br/>

    they just entered the deva city.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, thus gone to their city,<br/>

    the devas thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now that we've come to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    we will henceforth dwell by ourselves<br/>

    and have no dealings with the Asuras.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Asuras thought also:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Gone, indeed, are the devas to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    henceforth they'll dwell by themselves<br/>

    and have no dealings with us!'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, long ago (another) battle raged between the devas and Asuras;<br/>

    but in that fight the devas won<br/>

    and the Asuras were defeated.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the defeated Asuras fled,<br/>

    pursued by the devas,<br/>

    facing south.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then thought the Asuras:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The devas pursue us;<br/>

    what if we fight a second time!'</p>

    <p class="f4">And they did so<br/>

    but in that fight the devas won<br/>

    and the Asuras were defeated.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the defeated Asuras fled,<br/>

    pursued by the devas,<br/>

    facing south.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then thought the Asuras:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The devas pursue us;<br/>

    what if we fight a third time!'</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time they fought<br/>

    and the devas won<br/>

    and the Asuras were defeated;<br/>

    and defeated and fearful,<br/>

    they just entered<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the asura city;<br/>

    and thus gone to their city,<br/>

    the Asuras thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now that we've come to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    we will dwell by ourselves<br/>

    and have nothing to do with the devas.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the devas thought also:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Gone, indeed, are the Asuras to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">In just the same way, monks,<br/>

    what time a monk,<br/>

    aloof from sense desires,<br/>

    aloof from evil ideas,<br/>

    enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>

    wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>

    which is born of solitude<br/>

    and is full of zest and ease,<br/>

    he thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now that I have come to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[291]</b></span> I will henceforth dwell by myself<br/>

    and have no dealings with Mara.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And Mara, the Evil One, thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now that the monk has gone to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    he will dwell by himself and have no dealings with me.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, what time a monk<br/>

    suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>

    which is self-evolved,<br/>

    born of concentration,<br/>

    full of zest and ease,<br/>

    free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed,<br/>

    he thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now that I have come to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    I will henceforth dwell by myself<br/>

    and have no dealings with Mara.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And Mara, the Evil One, thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now that the monk has gone to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    he will dwell by himself and have no dealings with me.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, what time a monk<br/>

    free from the fervour of zest,<br/>

    mindful and self-possessed,<br/>

    enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>

    and experiences in his being<br/>

    that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br/>

    "He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease,<br/>

    he thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now that I have come to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    I will henceforth dwell by myself<br/>

    and have no dealings with Mara.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And Mara, the Evil One, thinks:</p>

    he will dwell by himself and have no dealings with me.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, what time a monk<br/>

    by putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>

    by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br/>

    enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>

    which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br/>

    and is free of ease and ill<br/>

    he thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now that I have come to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    I will henceforth dwell by myself<br/>

    and have no dealings with Mara.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And Mara, the Evil One, thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now that the monk has gone to the refuge for the fearful,<br/>

    he will dwell by himself and have no dealings with me.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, when a monk<br/>

    by passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br/>

    by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br/>

    unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>

    enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br/>

    'Space is infinite'<br/>

    he is said to have put a darkness<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> about Mara,<br/>

    and Mara's vision, being blotted out<br/>

    is without range;<br/>

    and he has become invisible to the Evil One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, when a monk<br/>

    passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br/>

    enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br/>

    'Consciousness is infinite'<br/>

    he is said to have put a darkness about Mara,<br/>

    and Mara's vision, being blotted out<br/>

    is without range;<br/>

    and he has become invisible to the Evil One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, when a monk<br/>

    passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>

    enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br/>

    'There is nothing'<br/>

    he is said to have put a darkness about Mara,<br/>

    and Mara's vision, being blotted out<br/>

    is without range;<br/>

    and he has become invisible to the Evil One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, when a monk<br/>

    passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception<br/>

    and by wisdom sees that the cankers are completely destroyed,<br/>

    he is said to have put a darkness about Mara<br/>

    and Mara's vision, being blotted out,<br/>

    is rangeless;<br/>

    and he has become invisible to the Evil One<br/>

    and has passed through the world's entanglement.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> observes that the fight was due to the Asuras remembering the fruit of the divine <i>Pāricchattaka</i> tree (see above, p. 78) and to their anger at not being able to enjoy the fruit. See <i>K.S.</i> i, 279; v. 378; <i>Dial.</i> ii, 318; <i>F. Dial.</i> i, 181; <i>J.</i> i, 202; <i>SnA</i> 485.</p>
