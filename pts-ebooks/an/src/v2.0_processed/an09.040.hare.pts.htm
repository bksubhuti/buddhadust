    <h1>The Tusker<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[291]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One said this to the Monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, when bull or cow or young or baby elephant,<br/>

    browsing on the grass-tops,<br/>

    forestalls some forest tusker about to take his feed,<br/>

    so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed;<br/>

    when bull or cow or young or baby elephant<br/>

    devouring the bunches<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of broken boughs<br/>

    forestalls some forest tusker about to take his feed,<br/>

    so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed;<br/>

    when bull or cow or young or baby elephant,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span> stirring up the water with his trunk,<br/>

    forestalls the forest tusker,<br/>

    gone down to the water-hole<br/>

    so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed;<br/>

    when cow elephants go and rub against the body of the tusker, gone down to the water-hole,<br/>

    so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed:<br/>

    then, monks, the forest tusker thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I'faith, I live now in a crowd of bull elephants,<br/>

    cow elephants,<br/>

    young elephants,<br/>

    baby elephants;<br/>

    I eat merely grass-stubble;<br/>

    they eat my bunches of broken boughs;<br/>

    I drink muddied water;<br/>

    and cow elephants come and rub against my body<br/>

    when I've gone to the water-hole!</p>

    <p class="f4">What if I dwell alone,<br/>

    withdrawn from the herd?'</p>

    <p class="f4">And presently, monks, he dwells alone,<br/>

    withdrawn from the herd;<br/>

    and he eats uncropped grass,<br/>

    and none devours his bunches of boughs;<br/>

    he drinks unmuddied water,<br/>

    and cow elephants come not and rub against him in the water-hole.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And at that time he thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'In the past I dwelt in a crowd of bull elephants,<br/>

    cow elephants,<br/>

    young elephants,<br/>

    baby elephants;<br/>

    I ate merely grass-stubble;<br/>

    they ate my bunches of broken boughs;<br/>

    I drank muddied water;<br/>

    and cow elephants came and rubbed against my body<br/>

    when I went to the water-hole;<br/>

    but now I dwell alone,<br/>

    withdrawn from the herd;<br/>

    and I eat uncropped grass,<br/>

    and none devours my bunches of boughs;<br/>

    and I drink unmuddied water,<br/>

    and cow elephants come not and rub against me in the water-hole.'</p>

    <p class="f4">and breaking off a bunch of boughs with his trunk,<br/>

    he rubs his body with it and joyfully allays the itch.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And it is just so, monks,<br/>

    when a monk lives in a crowd of monks, nuns, lay-disciples,<br/>

    both men and women,<br/>

    rajahs, their ministers,<br/>

    course-setters and their disciples;<br/>

    he thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Truly I now live in a crowd of monks, nuns, lay-disciples,<br/>

    both men and women,<br/>

    rajahs, their ministers,<br/>

    course-setters and their disciples!</p>

    <p class="f4">What if I were to live alone,<br/>

    withdrawn from the horde?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And he resorts to some secluded dwelling:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> forest,<br/>

    tree-root,<br/>

    mountain,<br/>

    glen,<br/>

    cliff-cave,<br/>

    cemetery,<br/>

    wooded upland,<br/>

    open space<br/>

    or heap of straw -<br/>

    and come to forest,<br/>

    tree-root<br/>

    or empty hut,<br/>

    he sits crossed legged,<br/>

    holds his body erect<br/>

    and sets mindfulness before him.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And putting away worldly coveting,<br/>

    he abides with mind freed therefrom;<br/>

    he purges his mind of coveting:<br/>

    putting away ill-will and hatred,<br/>

    he abides with mind free therefrom;<br/>

    kindly, compassionate towards all creatures,<br/>

    he purges his mind of ill-will and hatred;<br/>

    putting away sloth and torpor,<br/>

    he abides freed therefrom;<br/>

    conscious,<br/>

    alert,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    mindful,<br/>

    self-possessed,<br/>

    he purges his mind of sloth and torpor:<br/>

    putting away flurry and worry,<br/>

    he abides unflurried;<br/>

    with mind inwardly calmed,<br/>

    he <span class="f2 g"><b>[293]</b></span> purges his mind of flurry and worry;<br/>

    putting away doubt,<br/>

    he abides with doubt passed by;<br/>

    no 'how? how?' questioner,<br/>

    he purges his mind of doubt as to right things.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And putting away these five hindrances,<br/>

    weakening the mind's corruptions<br/>

    by wisdom,<br/>

    aloof from sense desires,<br/>

    aloof from evil ideas,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>

    wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>

    which is born of solitude<br/>

    and is full of zest and ease.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>

    which is self-evolved,<br/>

    born of concentration,<br/>

    full of zest and ease,<br/>

    free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br/>

    mindful and self-possessed,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>

    and experiences in his being<br/>

    that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">By putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>

    by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>

    which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br/>

    and is free of ease and ill.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br/>

    by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br/>

    unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br/>

    'Space is infinite'.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br/>

    'Consciousness is infinite'.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br/>

    'There is nothing'.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the ending of perception and feeling<br/>

    and seeing by wisdom that the cankers are completely destroyed, he rejoices greatly at having allayed the irritant."</p>
