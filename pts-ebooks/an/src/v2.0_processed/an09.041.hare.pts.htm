    <h1>Tapussa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[293]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One dwelt among the Mallas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> near their market-town called Uruvelakappa<br/>

    and had one morning robed early,<br/>

    taken bowl and cloak,<br/>

    entered Uruvelakappa for alms,<br/>

    gone his rounds,<br/>

    returned and eaten his meal,<br/>

    he called the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Prithee wait here, Ānanda,<br/>

    while I am gone into Mahavana for the midday rest."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," he rejoined;<br/>

    and the Exalted One entered Mahavana for the midday rest<br/>

    and sat down at the foot of a tree.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the goodman, Tapussa, visited the venerable Ānanda,<br/>

    saluted him and sat down at one side;<br/>

    and so seated, he said thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"We householders, reverend Ānanda,<br/>

    are pleasure-seekers,<br/>

    pleasure-fond,<br/>

    pleasure-doting,<br/>

    pleasure-mad<br/>

    and, being so,<br/>

    it seems a real precipice to us,<br/>

    this giving up of all;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    yet I've heard, reverend sir,<br/>

    that in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>

    the heart of every young monk<br/>

    leaps up at this giving up,<br/>

    becomes <span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span> calm, steadfast and inclined<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> thereto,<br/>

    seeing it is the peace.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And just there, reverend sir,<br/>

    is the difference in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>

    'twixt monk and the many folk,<br/>

    I mean in this giving up.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This, indeed, is a topic for a talk, goodman!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let us go and see the Exalted One;<br/>

    we will visit him<br/>

    and tell him the matter,<br/>

    and as the Exalted One explains,<br/>

    so we will bear it in mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Very well, sir,'<br/>

    replied the goodman to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda went<br/>

    with the goodman, Tapussa,<br/>

    and visited the Exalted One,<br/>

    saluted and sat down at one side;<br/>

    and the venerable Ānanda told the Exalted One all the goodman had said ...</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is verily so, Ānanda,<br/>

    it is verily so!</p>

    <p class="f4">When I was but a being awakening, Ānanda,<br/>

    and not wholly awakened,<br/>

    ere there was full awakenment,<br/>

    I thought thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Good is the giving up of all;<br/>

    good it is to go apart<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> —<br/>

    but my mind leapt not up,<br/>

    became not calm,<br/>

    steadfast,<br/>

    nor inclined to this giving up<br/>

    though I saw:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is the peace."'</p>

    <p class="f4">And I thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what's the cause, the reason <i>my mind leaps not up,<br/>

    becomes not calm,<br/>

    steadfast,<br/>

    nor inclined to this giving up<br/>

    though I saw:</i></p>

    <p class="f4"><i>"It is the peace."'?</i></p>

    <p class="f4">Then I thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The peril of pleasures is not seen by me,<br/>

    its not made much of by me;<br/>

    the advantage of this giving up<br/>

    is not won,<br/>

    is not enjoyed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> by me;<br/>

    so my mind leaps not up,<br/>

    becomes calm,<br/>

    steadfast,<br/>

    nor inclined to this giving up<br/>

    though I see it is the peace.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And I thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'If, seeing the peril of pleasures,<br/>

    I were to make much of it;<br/>

    if, winning the advantage of this giving up,<br/>

    I were to enjoy it;<br/>

    it would surely happen<br/>

    that my mind would leap up,<br/>

    become calm,<br/>

    steadfast<br/>

    and inclined to this giving up<br/>

    on seeing it to be the peace.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And presently, Ānanda,<br/>

    on seeing the peril<br/>

    I made much <span class="f2 g"><b>[295]</b></span> of it;<br/>

    on winning the advantage<br/>

    I enjoyed it;<br/>

    and my mind leapt up,<br/>

    became calm,<br/>

    steadfast<br/>

    and inclined to this giving up<br/>

    on seeing it was the peace.</p>

    <p class="f4">And presently, Ānanda,<br/>

    aloof from sense desires,<br/>

    <i>aloof from evil ideas,</i><br/>

    I entered and abode in the first musing;<br/>

    but as I abode in this abiding,<br/>

    thoughts and distractions<br/>

    of a sensuous kind beset me;<br/>

    and it was for me a disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as some ill,<br/>

    amounting to a disease,<br/>

    might arise in some happy person, Ānanda,<br/>

    even so such thoughts and distractions<br/>

    of a sensuous kind beset me<br/>

    and it was for me a disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what's the cause,<br/>

    the reason my mind leaps not up,<br/>

    becomes not calm,<br/>

    steadfast,<br/>

    nor inclined to this giving up of thoughts and distractions<br/>

    of a sensuous kind,<br/>

    though I saw:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is the peace."'?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">What if I were to suppress applied and sustained thought ... and enter and abide in the second musing ...</p>

    <p class="f4">the third ...</p>

    <p class="f4">the fourth musing ...</p>

    <p class="f4">the sphere of infinite space ...</p>

    <p class="f4">of infinite consciousness ...</p>

    <p class="f4">of nothingness ...</p>

    <p class="f4">of neither perception nor non-perception<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> ... in the ending of perception and feeling?</p>

    <p class="f4">And presently, Ānanda,<br/>

    passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br/>

    I entered and abode in the ending of perception and feeling<br/>

    and I saw by wisdom<br/>

    that the cankers were completely destroyed.</p>

    <p class="f4">And so long, Ānanda,<br/>

    as I attained not to,<br/>

    emerged not from<br/>

    these nine attainments of gradual abidings,<br/>

    both forwards and backwards,<br/>

    I realized not completely,<br/>

    as one wholly awakened,<br/>

    the full perfect awakening,<br/>

    unsurpassed in the world<br/>

    with its gods,<br/>

    Maras and Brahmas,<br/>

    on earth with its recluses,<br/>

    godly men,<br/>

    devas and men;<br/>

    but when I attained to<br/>

    and emerged from<br/>

    these abidings,<br/>

    both forwards and backwards,<br/>

    then, wholly awakened,<br/>

    I realized completely<br/>

    the full perfect awakening<br/>

    unsurpassed in the world<br/>

    with its gods,<br/>

    Maras and Brahmas,<br/>

    on earth with its recluses,<br/>

    godly men,<br/>

    devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then knowledge and vision<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> rose up within me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Mind's release for me is unshakable,<br/>

    this birth is final,<br/>

    there is now no becoming again.'"</p>
