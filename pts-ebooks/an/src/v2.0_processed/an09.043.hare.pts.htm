    <h1>The Seer-in-Body<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[297]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][olds]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once, when the venerable Ānanda was dwelling near Kosambī<br/>

    in Ghosita Park,<br/>

    the venerable Udāyin visited him<br/>

    and, after exchanging the usual polite talk,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">And so seated, he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Seer-in-body, seer-in-body, he is called, sir;<br/>

    and as to what<br/>

    has the seer-in-body been declared by the Exalted One?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>

    aloof from sense desires,<br/>

    aloof from evil ideas,<br/>

    enters and abides in the first musing,<br/>

    wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br/>

    which is born of solitude<br/>

    and is full of zest and ease<br/>

    and to the extent of that sphere<br/>

    abides with body attuned<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to it -<br/>

    thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>

    has the seer-in-body been declared by the Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the second musing,<br/>

    which is self-evolved,<br/>

    born of concentration,<br/>

    full of zest and ease,<br/>

    free from applied and sustained thought,<br/>

    wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed<br/>

    and to the extent of that sphere<br/>

    abides with body attuned to it -<br/>

    thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>

    has the seer-in-body been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>

    free from the fervour of zest,<br/>

    mindful and self-possessed,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the third musing,<br/>

    and experiences in his being<br/>

    that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br/>

    "He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease,"<br/>

    and to the extent of that sphere<br/>

    abides with body attuned to it -<br/>

    thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>

    has the seer-in-body been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>

    by putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br/>

    by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br/>

    which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br/>

    and is free of ease and ill<br/>

    and to the extent of that sphere<br/>

    abides with body attuned to it -<br/>

    thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>

    has the seer-in-body been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>

    by passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br/>

    by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br/>

    unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br/>

    'Space is infinite'<br/>

    and to the extent of that sphere<br/>

    abides with body attuned to it -<br/>

    thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>

    has the seer-in-body been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>

    passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br/>

    'Consciousness is infinite'<br/>

    and to the extent of that sphere<br/>

    abides with body attuned to it -<br/>

    thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>

    has the seer-in-body been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>

    passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br/>

    'There is nothing'<br/>

    and to the extent of that sphere<br/>

    abides with body attuned to it -<br/>

    thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>

    has the seer-in-body been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>

    passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception<br/>

    and to the extent of that sphere<br/>

    abides with body attuned to it -<br/>

    thus far, sir, in one particular<br/>

    has the seer-in-body been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br/>

    passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br/>

    he enters and abides in the ending of perception and feeling<br/>

    and seeing by wisdom that the cankers are completely destroyed<br/>

    and to the extent of that sphere<br/>

    abides with body attuned to it -<br/>

    thus far, sir, and with no (further) particular<br/>

    has the seer-in-body been declared by the Exalted One.</p>
