    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five which are a source of weakness to training.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Taking life;<br/>

    taking what is not given;<br/>

    lustful, evil practices;<br/>

    lying;<br/>

    and indulging in spirituous liquors,<br/>

    which cause idleness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the five which are a source of weakness to training.</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>Throughout this chapter Hare has this as "When these five ... then;" but it should be "To let go of these five ... the four should be made to become." Some of the preceding clauses cannot be let go prior to establishing the Satipaṭṭhānas.</p>
