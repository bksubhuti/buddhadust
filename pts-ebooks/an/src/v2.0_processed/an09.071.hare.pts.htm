    <h1>Mental Barrenness</h1>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five forms of mental barrenness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk has doubts and is perplexed about the Teacher,<br/>

    is not certain nor<br/>

    sure concerning him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso doubts and is perplexed about the Teacher,<br/>

    is not certain<br/>

    nor sure concerning him,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the first mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So, too, when a monk has doubts and is perplexed about	Dhamma,<br/>

    is not certain<br/>

    nor sure concerning the Dhamma,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the second mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So, too, when a monk has doubts and is perplexed about the Order,<br/>

    is not certain<br/>

    nor sure concerning the Order,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the third mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So, too, when a monk has doubts and is perplexed about the training,<br/>

    is not certain<br/>

    nor sure concerning the training,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the fourth mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So too, when	he	is	angry with his fellows in the godly life,<br/>

    displeased with them,<br/>

    upset about them,<br/>

    is as a barren waste<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> for them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso is <span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span> angry with his fellows,<br/>

    displeased with them,<br/>

    upset about them<br/>

    and is as a barren waste for them,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the fifth mental barrenness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the five forms of mental barrenness.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>Throughout this chapter Hare has this as "When these five ... then;" but it should be "To let go of these five ... the four should be made to become." Some of the preceding clauses cannot be let go prior to establishing the Satipaṭṭhānas.</p>
