    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five forms of mental bondage.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk as regards the lusts<br/>

    is not completely free of passion,<br/>

    nor of desire,<br/>

    nor of fondness,<br/>

    nor of thirst,<br/>

    nor of fever,<br/>

    nor of craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br/>

    nor of desire,<br/>

    nor of fondness,<br/>

    nor of thirst,<br/>

    nor of fever,<br/>

    nor of craving<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the first mental bondage.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So, too, when a monk as regards the body<br/>

    is not completely free of passion,<br/>

    nor of desire,<br/>

    nor of fondness,<br/>

    nor of thirst,<br/>

    nor of fever,<br/>

    nor of craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br/>

    nor of desire,<br/>

    nor of fondness,<br/>

    nor of thirst,<br/>

    nor of fever,<br/>

    nor of craving<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the second mental bondage.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So, too, when a monk as regards shapes<br/>

    is not completely free of passion,<br/>

    nor of desire,<br/>

    nor of fondness,<br/>

    nor of thirst,<br/>

    nor of fever,<br/>

    nor of craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br/>

    nor of desire,<br/>

    nor of fondness,<br/>

    nor of thirst,<br/>

    nor of fever,<br/>

    nor of craving<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the third mental bondage.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So, too, when a monk if,<br/>

    after eating as much as his belly can hold,<br/>

    he give himself over to the ease of bed,<br/>

    of (lying on his) back,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    of slumber<br/>

    is not completely free of passion,<br/>

    nor of desire,<br/>

    nor of fondness,<br/>

    nor of thirst,<br/>

    nor of fever,<br/>

    nor of craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br/>

    nor of desire,<br/>

    nor of fondness,<br/>

    nor of thirst,<br/>

    nor of fever,<br/>

    nor of craving<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the fourth mental bondage.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So, too, when a monk if he live the godly life<br/>

    set on gaining some celestial body,<br/>

    thinking by virtue,<br/>

    practice,<br/>

    austerity<br/>

    or chastity<br/>

    to become a deva,<br/>

    or one of the retinue of a deva,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br/>

    nor of desire,<br/>

    nor of fondness,<br/>

    nor of thirst,<br/>

    his heart inclines not to ardour,<br/>

    devotion,<br/>

    perseverance,<br/>

    nor to exertion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br/>

    it is the fifth mental bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the five forms of mental bondage.</p>

    <p>Throughout this chapter Hare has this as "When these five ... then;" but it should be "To let go of these five ... the four should be made to become." Some of the preceding clauses cannot be let go prior to establishing the Satipaṭṭhānas.</p>
