    <h1>The Training</h1>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five which are a source of weakness to training.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Taking life;<br/>

    taking what is not given;<br/>

    lustful, evil practices;<br/>

    lying;<br/>

    and indulging in spirituous liquors,<br/>

    which cause idleness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the five which are a source of weakness to training.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, when these five sources of weakness to training are put away,<br/>

    four bases of psychic<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> power<br/>

    should be made to become.</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>Throughout this chapter Hare has this as "When these five ... then;" but it should be "To let go of these five ... the four should be made to become."</p>
