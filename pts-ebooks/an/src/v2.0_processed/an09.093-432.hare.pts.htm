    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied;<br/>

    and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, for the complete understanding of passion nine states must be made to become.</p>

    <p class="f4">What nine?</p>

    <p class="f4">The thought of foulness,<br/>

    of the repulsiveness of food,<br/>
