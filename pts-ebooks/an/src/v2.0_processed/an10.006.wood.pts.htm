    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][olds][bodh]</span> Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    saluted him and sat down at one side.<br/>

    So seated he said this to the Exalted One: </p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray sir, may it be<br/>

    that a monk's winning of concentration<br/>

    is of such a sort<br/>

    that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>

    in water unaware of water,<br/>

    in heat unaware of heat,<br/>

    in air unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>

    that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>

    in the world beyond unaware of it<br/>

    and yet at the same time does perceive?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"It may be so, Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">A monk's winning of concentration may be of such a sort<br/>

    that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>

    in water unaware of water,<br/>

    in heat unaware of heat,<br/>

    in air unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>

    that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>

    in the world beyond unaware of it<br/>

    and yet at the same time he may perceive."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, sir, in what way<br/>

    may a monk's winning of concentration<br/>

    be of such a sort<br/>

    that still he does perceive?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2">[8]</span> "Herein, Ānanda, a monk has this perception:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the real,<br/>

    this is the best, namely,<br/>

    the calming of all activities,<br/>

    the rejection of all substrate,<br/>

    the ending of craving,<br/>

    the fading of <span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span> interest, stopping, nibbāna.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">In such a way, Ānanda, a monk's winning of concentration may be of such a sort<br/>

    that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>

    in water unaware of water,<br/>

    in heat unaware of heat,<br/>

    in air unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>

    that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>

    in the world beyond unaware of it<br/>

    and yet at the same time he does perceive."</p>
