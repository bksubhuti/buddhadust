    <p><span class="f2">[8]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh][olds]</span> Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    greeted him courteously, and after the exchange of greetings and reminiscent talk,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the venerable Ānanda said this to the Venerable Sāriputta: </p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray Sāriputta, your reverence, may it be<br/>

    that a monk's winning of concentration<br/>

    is of such a sort<br/>

    that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>

    in water unaware of water,<br/>

    in heat unaware of heat,<br/>

    in air unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>

    that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>

    in the world beyond unaware of it<br/>

    and yet at the same time does perceive?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2">[9]</span> "Yes Ānanda, your reverence, a monk's winning of concentration may be of such a sort<br/>

    that in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>

    in water unaware of water,<br/>

    in heat unaware of heat,<br/>

    in air unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>

    that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>

    in the world beyond unaware of it<br/>

    and yet at the same time he may perceive."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, Sāriputta, your reverence, in what way<br/>

    may that be?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Once on a time, Ānanda, your reverence,<br/>

    I myself was staying near this same Sāvatthī in Dark Wood,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    and on that occasion I attained to concentration of such a sort<br/>

    that in earth I was unaware of earth,<br/>

    in water unaware of water,<br/>

    in heat unaware of heat,<br/>

    in air unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>

    that in this world I was unaware of this world,<br/>

    in the world beyond unaware of it<br/>

    and yet at the same time I did perceive."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray what did you perceive on that occasion, Sāriputta, your reverence?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"One perception arose in me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'To end becoming is nibbāna.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Another perception faded out in me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'To end becoming<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is nibbāna.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, your reverence,<br/>

    from a fire of splinters<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    one spark arises<br/>

    and another sprak fades out,<br/>

    even so in me<br/>

    one perception arose:</p>

    <p class="f4">'To end becoming is nibbāna',<br/>

    and another perception,<br/>

    that to end becoming is nibbāna,<br/>

    faded out in me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet at the same time, your reverence,<br/>

    I consciously perceived."</p>
