    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Complete in five factors, monks,<br/>

    a monk who follows after and resorts to<br/>

    the lodging-place<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> which is complete in five factors<br/>

    in no long time,<br/>

    by destroying the cankers,<br/>

    realizes in this same visible existence<br/>

    the heart's release,<br/>

    the release by insight,<br/>

    thoroughly comprehending it of himself,<br/>

    and having attained it<br/>

    abides therein.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">How is a monk complete in five factors?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk is a believer;<br/>

    he believes:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He that Exalted <span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span> One, Arahant,<br/>

    is a perfectly Enlightened One,<br/>

    perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>

    a Welfarer,<br/>

    a world-knower,<br/>

    trainer unsurpassed of men to be trained,<br/>

    teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>

    Awakened One,<br/>

    Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover he is little troubled by sickness and disease;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he is furnished with digestive power<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    not too hot or too cold,<br/>

    but even<br/>

    and suitable for striving;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he is honest,<br/>

    no deceiver,<br/>

    he is one who shows himself as he really is<br/>

    to the Teacher,<br/>

    to his discerning co-mates in the brahma-life;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he dwells resolute in energy,<br/>

    ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br/>

    stout and strong to acquire good qualities,<br/>

    not shirking the burden in good qualities;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">he is a man of insight,<br/>

    possessed of insight<br/>

    for tracing the rise and fall of things,<br/>

    insight that is Ariyan,<br/>

    penetrating,<br/>

    going on to the utter destruction of ill.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">In this way, monks,<br/>

    a monk is complete in five factors.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is one's lodging-place complete in five factors?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a lodging-place<br/>

    is not too far<br/>

    and not too near (a village),<br/>

    but suitable for coming and going,<br/>

    by day not frequented,<br/>

    by night quiet and undisturbed by noise,<br/>

    not plagued with contact of flies,<br/>

    mosquitoes,<br/>

    wind,<br/>

    rain<br/>

    and creeping things.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, for one dwelling in such a lodging-place<br/>

    the supply of robes and alms-food,<br/>

    of bed and lodging,<br/>

    comforts in sickness<br/>

    and medicaments<br/>

    comes about with little trouble;</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">further in that lodging-place<br/>

    dwell elder monks who have heard much,<br/>

    who are versed in the sayings,<br/>

    who know the teachings thoroughly,<br/>

    <span class="f2">[16]</span> who know the discipline and summaries by heart.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Consorting with them from time to time<br/>

    he inquires of them<br/>

    and questions them <span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How is this, your reverence?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the meaning of this?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Those worthies then open up to him<br/>

    what was sealed,<br/>

    make clear what was obscure,<br/>

    and on divers doubtful points of doctrine<br/>

    they resolve his doubts.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is how one's lodging-place is complete in five factors.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, monks, complete in five factors,<br/>

    a monk who follows after<br/>

    and resorts to the lodging-plaee<br/>

    complete also in five factors<br/>

    in no long time,<br/>

    by destroying the cankers,<br/>

    realizes in this same visible existence<br/>

    the heart's release,<br/>

    the release by insight,<br/>

    thoroughly comprehending it of himself,<br/>

    and having attained it abides therein."</p>
