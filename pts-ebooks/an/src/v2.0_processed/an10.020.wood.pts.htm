    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Kurus at Kammasadhamma,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> a township of the Kurus.</p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these ten ways of Ariyan living,<br/>

    according to which Ariyans have lived,<br/>

    do live<br/>

    and shall live.</p>

    <p class="f4">What ten?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk has abandoned five factors,<br/>

    is possessed of six factors,<br/>

    guards one factor,<br/>

    observes the four bases,<br/>

    has shaken off individual belief,<br/>

    has utterly given up longings,<br/>

    his thoughts are unclouded,<br/>

    his body-complex is tranquillized,<br/>

    he is well released in heart,<br/>

    he is well released by insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the ten ways of Ariyan living,<br/>

    according to which Ariyans have lived,<br/>

    do live<br/>

    and shall live.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is a monk one who has abandoned five factors?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk has abandoned sensual desires,<br/>

    malevolence,<br/>

    sloth-and-torpor,<br/>

    worry-and-flurry,<br/>

    doubt-and-wavering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is one who has abandoned five factors.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is a monk one who is possessed of six factors?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk, seeing an object with the eye,<br/>

    is not elated or depressed,<br/>

    but lives indifferent,<br/>

    mindful<br/>

    and composed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the ear,<br/>

    is not elated or depressed,<br/>

    but lives indifferent,<br/>

    mindful<br/>

    and composed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

    <p class="f4">Smelling a scent with the <span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span> nose,<br/>

    is not elated or depressed,<br/>

    but lives indifferent,<br/>

    mindful<br/>

    and composed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

    <p class="f4">Tasting a savour with the tongue,<br/>

    is not elated or depressed,<br/>

    but lives indifferent,<br/>

    mindful<br/>

    and composed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

    <p class="f4">Contacting an object with the body,<br/>

    is not elated or depressed,<br/>

    but lives indifferent,<br/>

    <p class="f4">With mind cognizing mental states,<br/>

    is not elated or depressed,<br/>

    but lives indifferent,<br/>

    mindful<br/>

    and composed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is a monk possessed of six factors.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how does a monk guard one factor?</p>

    <p class="f4">By guarding mindfulness<br/>

    he is composed in mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he guards one factor.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how does a monk observe the four bases?</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>Bhk. Bodhi's translation is much clearer:<br/>

    "<i>...four supports? Here, having reflected, a bhikkhu uses some things, patiently endures other things, avoids still other things, and dispels still other things.</i>" It is a generic instruction. For details see: MN 2</p>
