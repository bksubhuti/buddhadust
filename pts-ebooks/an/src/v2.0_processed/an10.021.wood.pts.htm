    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, the lion, king of beasts, at eventide comes forth from his lair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having come forth from his lair he stretches himself.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having done so, he surveys the four quarters in all directions.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having done that he utters thrice his lion's roar.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thrice having uttered his lion's roar<br/>

    he sallies forth in search of prey.</p>
