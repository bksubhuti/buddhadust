    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side<br/>

    and the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever things, Ānanda,<br/>

    conduce to realizing the truth<br/>

    of this or that statement of doctrine,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    confidently do I claim,<br/>

    after thorough comprehension of it,<br/>

    to teach dhamma about them<br/>

    in such a way that,<br/>

    when proficient,<br/>

    a man shall know of the real that it is,<br/>

    of the unreal that it is not;<br/>

    of the mean that it is mean,<br/>

    of the exalted that it is exalted;<br/>

    of that which has something beyond it,<br/>

    that it has something beyond it;<br/>

    of that which is unsurpassed,<br/>

    that it is unsurpassed.</p>

    <p class="f4">For there is the possibility<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of his knowing<br/>

    or seeing<br/>

    or realizing that which can be known,<br/>

    seen or realized.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is knowledge unsurpassable,<br/>

    the knowledge of this or that thing<br/>

    as it really is.</p>

    <p class="f4">Than this knowledge, Ānanda,<br/>

    there is no other knowledge surpassing it<br/>

    or more excellent,<br/>

    I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ānanda, there are these ten Wayfarer's powers<br/>

    of the Wayfarer<br/>

    possessed of which powers<br/>

    the Wayfarer claims leadership,<br/>

    roars his lion's roar in the companies<br/>

    and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the ten?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, the Wayfarer knows,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    causal occasion (of a thing) as such,<br/>

    he claims leadership,<br/>

    roars his lion's roar<br/>

    and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, Ānanda, the Wayfarer knows,<br/>

    as it really is,<br/>

    the fruit of actions<br/>

    past, future and present,<br/>

    both in their causal occasion<br/>

    and in their conditions.</p>
