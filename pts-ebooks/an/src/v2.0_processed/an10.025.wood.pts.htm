    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these ten ranges of the devices.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What ten?</p>

    <p class="f4">One person perceives the earth-device<br/>

    as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Another person perceives the water-device<br/>

    as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Another person perceives the heat-device<br/>

    as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Another person perceives the air-device<br/>

    as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Another person perceives the blue-green<br/>

    as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Another person perceives the yellow<br/>

    as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Another person perceives the red<br/>

    as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Another person perceives the white<br/>

    as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Another person perceives the space-device<br/>

    as above, below, across, undivided, immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Another person perceives the intellection-device<br/>

    as above, below, across, as undivided, as immeasurable.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the ten ranges of the devices."</p>

    Using the thought 'unending is consciousness' as a basis and attaining the sphere of consciousness is the development of the consciousness device, it is said.<br/>

    Which doesn't help much. 'Feats in 4-dimensional matter' may refer to the phenomena of being outside time, where one is able to focus consciousness at any point past, future, or present their being no past, future or present (other than consciousness itself) in that state.</p>
