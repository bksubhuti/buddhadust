    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a great number of monks,<br/>

    robing themselves in the forenoon<br/>

    and taking bowl and robe,<br/>

    set out for Sāvatthī<br/>

    questing for alms-food.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now it occurred to those monks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is full early yet to range Sāvatthī for alms-food.<br/>

    Suppose we visit the park of the Wanderers holding other views."</p>

    <p class="f4">Accordingly they did so,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span>  and on getting there greeted them courteously, and,<br/>

    after the exchange of greetings and reminiscent talk,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated those Wanderers of other views said this to them:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Your reverences, Gotama the recluse thus teaches dhamma:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come ye, monks,<br/>

    do ye thoroughly grasp all dhamma,<br/>

    do ye dwell ever and always thoroughly grasping all dhamma.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, your reverences,<br/>

    we also thus teach dhamma to ourfollowers:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, your reverences,<br/>

    do ye thoroughly grasp all dhamma;<br/>

    do ye ever and always dwell thoroughly grasping all dhamma.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, your reverences,<br/>

    pray what is the distinction,<br/>

    what is the specific feature,<br/>

    what is the difference between Gotama the recluse and ourselves,<br/>

    <span class="f2">[49]</span>that is, between his teaching of dhamma and ours,<br/>

    or his way of instruction and ours?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon those monks made no reply,<br/>

    either of approval or of disapproval<br/>

    to those Wanderers holding other views;<br/>

    but without expressing either approval or disapproval<br/>

    they rose up and went away, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"We will learn the meaning of this saying<br/>

    in the company of the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So those monks,<br/>

    after ranging Sāvatthī for alms-food,<br/>

    on returning from their alms-round<br/>

    and after eating their meal,<br/>

    went tosee the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated they said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, here in the forenoon we robed ourselves<br/>

    and taking bowl and robe,<br/>

    set out for Sāvatthī<br/>

    questing for alms-food.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now it occurred to us thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is full early yet to range Sāvatthī for alms-food.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, your reverences,<br/>

    we also thus teach dhamma to ourfollowers:</p>
