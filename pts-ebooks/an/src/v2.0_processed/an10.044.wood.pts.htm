    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Kusinara in the Wood of Offerings.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, sir," replied those monks to the Exalted One, who said this:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[56]</b></span> "Monks, a monk who desires to admonish another<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    should do so after investigation<br/>

    of five conditions in his own self,<br/>

    after setting up<br/>

    five conditions in his own self.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the five conditions<br/>

    he should investigate in his own self?</p>

    <p class="f4">A monk who desires to admonish another<br/>

    must thus investigate:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Am I or am I not<br/>

    one who practises utter purity in body;<br/>

    am I or am I not<br/>

    possessed of utter purity in body<br/>

    flawless and untainted?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Is this quality manifest in me<br/>

    or is it not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">If he be not so,<br/>

    there are found folk who say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come now, let your reverence practise<br/>

    conduct as to body.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Folk are found to speak thus.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, a monk who desires to admonish another<br/>

    should thus investigate:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Am I or am I not<br/>

    one who practises utter purity in speech,<br/>

    flawless and untainted?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is this quality manifest in me<br/>

    or is it not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">If he be not so,<br/>

    there are found folk who say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come now, let your reverence practise<br/>

    conduct as to speech.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Folk are found to speak thus.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, a monk who desires to admonish another<br/>

    should thus investigate:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is a heart of goodwill<br/>

    free from malice<br/>

    established in me<br/>

    towards my fellows in the Brahma-life?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is this quality manifest in me<br/>

    or is it not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">If it be not so,<br/>

    there are found folk to say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come now, let your reverence practise<br/>

    the heart of goodwill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Folk are found to speak thus.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monks, a monk who desires to admonish another<br/>

    should thus investigate:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Am I or am I not<br/>

    one who has heard much,<br/>

    who bears in mind what he has heard,<br/>

    who hoards up what he has heard?</p>

    <p class="f4">Those teachings which,<br/>

    lovely alike at the beginning,<br/>

    the middle<br/>

    and the end (of life)<br/>

    proclaim in the spirit<br/>

    and in the letter<br/>

    the all-fulfilled,<br/>

    utterly purified Brahma-life -<br/>

    have such teachings been much heard by me,<br/>

    borne in mind,<br/>

    practised in speech,<br/>

    pondered in the heart<br/>

    and rightly penetrated by view?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is this quality manifest in me<br/>

    or is it not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, if he be not one who has heard much,<br/>

    who bears in mind what he has heard,<br/>

    who hoards up what he has heard;</p>

    <p class="f4">those teachings which,<br/>

    lovely alike at the beginning,<br/>

    the middle<br/>

    and the end (of life)<br/>

    proclaim in the spirit<br/>

    and in the letter<br/>

    the all-fulfilled,<br/>

    utterly purified Brahma-life -<br/>

    if such teachings have not been much heard by him,<br/>

    borne in mind,<br/>

    practised in speech,<br/>

    pondered in the heart<br/>

    and rightly penetrated by view,<br/>

    then folk are found to say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span> 'Come now, let your reverence complete knowledge of the Sayings.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Folk are found to speak thus.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, a monk who desires to admonish another<br/>

    should thus investigate:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Are-the obligations in full<br/>

    thoroughly learned by heart,<br/>

    well analysed<br/>

    with thorough knowledge of the meaning,<br/>

    clearly divided<br/>

    sutta by sutta<br/>

    and in minute detail by me?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is this condition manifest in me<br/>

    or is it not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">For if not there are found folk to say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'But where was this said by the Exalted One, your reverence?'</p>

    <p class="f4">When thus questioned he cannot explain.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then there will be those who say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come now, let your reverence<br/>

    train himself in the discipline.'</p>

    <p class="f4">There will be found folk to speak thus.</p>

    <p class="f4">These five conditions<br/>

    must be investigated in his own self.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what five conditions<br/>

    must be set up in his own self?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">(He considers:)</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do I speak in season or not?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Do I speak of facts or not,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">do I speak gently or harshly,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">do I speak words fraught with profit or not,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">do I speak with a kindly heart</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">or inwardly malicious?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">These five conditions<br/>

    he must set up in his own self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these five conditions<br/>

    are to be investigated in his own self,<br/>

    and these other five conditions<br/>

    are to be set up in his own self<br/>

    by a monk who desires to admonish another."</p>
