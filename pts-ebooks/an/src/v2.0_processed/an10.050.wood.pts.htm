    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[63]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion a number of monks<br/>

    after returning from their alms-round<br/>

    and eating their meal,<br/>

    as they sat assembled together in the service-hall,<br/>

    remained in strife and uproar and dispute,<br/>

    abusing each other<br/>

    with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One at eventide,<br/>

    rising from his solitude,<br/>

    approached the service-hall,<br/>

    and on reaching it<br/>

    sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had sat down<br/>

    the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, monks, in what talk were ye engaged<br/>

    as ye sit here,<br/>

    and what was the topic of your talk<br/>

    left unfinished?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Here, sir, after returning from our alms-round<br/>

    and eating our meal,<br/>

    we sat assembled together in the service-hall<br/>

    and remained in strife, uproar and dispute,<br/>

    abusing each other<br/>

    with the weapons of the tongue."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, it is not seemly for you clansmen,<br/>

    who in faith went forth from home to the homeless,<br/>

    thus to abide in strife, uproar and dispute,<br/>

    abusing each other<br/>

    with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, there are these ten conditions to be re- <span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span> membered,<br/>

    <span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> which, as they make for affection and respect,<br/>

    do conduce to fellow-feeling,<br/>

    to not-quarrelling,<br/>

    to concord<br/>

    and unity.</p>

    <p class="f4">What ten?</p>

    <p class="f4">3. Herein a monk is virtuous,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    restrained with the restraint of the obligation,<br/>

    proficient in following the practice of right conduct,<br/>

    seeing ground for fear in the minutest faults,<br/>

    and takes upon him<br/>

    and trains himself<br/>

    in the rules of morality.</p>

    he bears in mind what he has heard,<br/>

    he hoards up what he has heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">Those teachings which,<br/>

    alike lovely at the beginning,<br/>

    midway<br/>

    and at the end (of life),<br/>

    proclaim in spirit and in letter<br/>

    the all-fulfilled,<br/>

    utterly purified Brahma-life -<br/>

    suchlike are the teachings he has much heard,<br/>

    borne in mind,<br/>

    practised in speech,<br/>

    pondered in the heart<br/>

    and rightly penetrated by view.</p>
