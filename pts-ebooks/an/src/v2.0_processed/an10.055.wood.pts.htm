    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, your reverences."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence," replied those monks to the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    who then said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Your reverences, there is the frequent saying</p>

    <p class="f4">'A person whose nature is to wane.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now to what extent has a person been called by the Exalted One</p>

    <p class="f4">'a person whose nature is to wane,'</p>

    <p class="f4">and to what extent has a person been called</p>

    <p class="f4">'A person whose nature is to wax'?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"We would come from far, your reverence,<br/>

    to know the meaning of this<br/>

    in the presence of the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">It were well if the meaning of this saying<br/>

    were to occur to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2">[103]</span> Hearing it from the venerable Sāriputta<br/>

    the monks would bear it in mind."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, your reverences, do ye listen.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pay attention carefully<br/>

    and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"We will, your reverence,"<br/>

    replied those monks to the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    who then said:</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now to what extent was a person called<br/>

    'of a nature to wane'<br/>

    by the Exalted One?</p>

    <p><i>what is unintelligible:</i> <i>viññātañ and aviññātañ.</i> Intuitively understood/not intuitively understood. He has that ability or not. What is unintelligible is unintelligible. One cannot understand what is unintelligible. Some things can be objectively unintelligible (as, for example, a rock) other things are unintelligible to some but not to others. <i>Viññāta</i> was apparently unintelligible to Woodward.</p>
