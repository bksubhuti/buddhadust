    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying among the Magadhese at Nālakagāmaka.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Wanderer Sāmaṇḍakāni came to see the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    and on coming to him greeted him courteously and,<br/>

    after the exchange of courtesies and reminiscent talk,<br/>

    sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, Sāriputta, your reverence,<br/>

    in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>

    what is weal and what is woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Your reverence, when there is discontent<br/>

    this woe may be looked for:</p>

    <p class="f4">Whether one goes,<br/>

    stands,<br/>

    sits,<br/>

    or lies,<br/>

    he reaches not happiness and pleasure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whether he has gone to the forest,<br/>

    to the root of a tree,<br/>

    to a lonely place,<br/>

    to life in the open air,<br/>

    to life amid the monks,<br/>

    he reaches not happiness and pleasure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where there is discontent,<br/>

    this woe may be looked for.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Where there is content, your reverence,<br/>

    this weal may be looked for:</p>

    <p class="f4">Whether one goes,<br/>

    stands,<br/>

    sits<br/>

    or lies,<br/>

    he reaches happiness and pleasure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whether he has gone to the forest,<br/>

    to the root of a tree,<br/>

    to a lonely place,<br/>

    to a life in the open air<br/>

    or life amid the monks,<br/>

    he reaches happiness and pleasure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where there is content, your reverence,<br/>

    this weal may be looked for."</p>
