    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Vesāli in Great Grove,<br/>

    at the House with the Peaked Roof,<br/>

    together with a number of senior monks who were his disciples-namely,<br/>

    the venerable Cāla,<br/>

    Upacāla,<br/>

    Kakkaṭa,<br/>

    Kaḷimbha,<br/>

    Nikaṭa,<br/>

    and Kaṭissaha<br/>

    and other notable monks.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion a crowd of notable Licchavites,<br/>

    riding in their splendid cars<br/>

    in rivalry<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> with din and uproar,<br/>

    were dashing into Great Wood<br/>

    to see the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then those venerable ones thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Here is a crowd of notable Licchavites,<br/>

    riding in their splendid cars<br/>

    in rivalry with din and uproar,<br/>

    were dashing into Great Wood<br/>

    to see the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now it has been said by the Exalted One<br/>

    that noise is a thorn to musing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose we retreat to Gosinga Wood<br/>

    where is the sal grove;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    <span class="f2">[134]</span>there we can stay pleasantly,<br/>

    free from noise and crowds."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So those venerable ones retreated to Gosinga Wood,<br/>

    where is the sal grove,<br/>

    and there they stayed pleasantly,<br/>

    free from noise and crowds.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Later on the Exalted One called to the monks,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, where is  Cāla,<br/>

    Upacāla,<br/>

    Kakkaṭa,<br/>

    Kaḷimbha,<br/>

    Nikaṭa,<br/>

    and Kaṭissaha?</p>

    <p class="f4">Where are those monks,<br/>

    my senior disciples,<br/>

    gone?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span> "As to that, sir, it occurred to those venerable ones:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Here is a crowd of notable Licchavites,<br/>

    riding in their splendid cars<br/>

    in rivalry with din and uproar,<br/>

    dashing into Great Wood<br/>

    to see the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now it has been said by the Exalted One<br/>

    that noise is a thorn to musing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose we retreat to Gosinga Wood,<br/>

    where is the sal grove;<br/>

    there we can stay pleasantly,<br/>

    free from noise and crowds.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So, sir, those venerable ones are gone there.</p>

    <p class="f4">There they are staying pleasantly,<br/>

    free from noise and crowds."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said! Well said, monks!</p>

    <p class="f4">Those who should assert<br/>

    what those great disciples have asserted<br/>

    would rightly do so.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, monks, I have said<br/>

    that noise is a thorn to musing.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these ten thorns.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">What ten?</p>

    <p class="f4"><b>[1]</b> To one who delights in seclusion<br/>

    delight in society is a thorn.</p>
