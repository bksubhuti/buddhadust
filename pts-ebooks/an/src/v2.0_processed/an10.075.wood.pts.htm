    than that other person.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because the ear of dhamma<br/>

    saves this person.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Who save the Wayfarer<br/>

    could know the cause herein?</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda,<br/>

    be ye not measurers of persons,<br/>

    take not the measure of persons.</p>

    <p class="f4">A person is ruined, Ānanda,<br/>

    by taking the measure of other persons.</p>

    <p class="f4">But I myself, Ānanda,<br/>

    and whoso is like unto me,<br/>

    could take the measure of persons.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">In the knowledge of the destiny of others, Ānanda,<br/>

    who is the woman disciple Migasālā -<br/>

    just a foolish, witless female woman,<br/>

    with just a woman's wit -<br/>

    and who are the individuals,<br/>

    the male men who have the knowledge of the destiny of others?</p>

    <p class="f4">So, Ānanda, these ten persons are found existing in the world.</p>

    <p>Bhk. Bodhi [here and at AN 6.44] has made better sense of this than either Woodward or Hare:<br/>

    <i>"...if Isidatta had possessed the same kind of virtuous behavior that Purāṇa had, Purāṇa could not have even known his destination. And if Purāṇa had possessed the same kind of wisdom that Isidatta had, Isidatta could not have even known his destination. In this way, Ānanda, these two persons were each deficient in one respect."</i><br/>

    by "not even known his destination" is meant that had the deficient quality been present, that one would have become Arahant.</p>
