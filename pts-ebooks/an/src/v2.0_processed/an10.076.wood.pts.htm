    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, were not three states found existing in the world,<br/>

    the Wayfarer would not arise in the world,<br/>

    an arahant rightly enlightened;<br/>

    nor would the Dhamma-discipline proclaimed by the Wayfarer<br/>

    be shown in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the three states?</p>

    <p class="f4">Birth, decay and death.</p>

    <p class="f4">Were not these three states found existing in the world, the Wayfarer would not arise in the world,<br/>

    an arahant rightly enlightened;<br/>

    nor would the Dhamma-discipline proclaimed by the Wayfarer<br/>

    be shown in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">But since these three states are found<br/>

    therefore the Wayfarer does arise in the world,<br/>

    an arahant rightly enlightened,<br/>

    and the Dhamma-discipline proclaimed by the Wayfarer<br/>

    is shown in the world.</p>
