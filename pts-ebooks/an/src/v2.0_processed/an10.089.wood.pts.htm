    <h1>The Kokālikan<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[113]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Kokālikan monk came to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires,<br/>

    they are a prey to wicked desires."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

    <p class="f4">Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

    <p class="f4">Calm your heart towards Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of dear virtues are Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then for a second time the Kokālikan monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires,<br/>

    they are a prey to wicked desires."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time the Exalted One reproved him saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

    <p class="f4">Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

    <p class="f4">Calm your heart towards Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of dear virtues are Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then for a third time the Kokālikan monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires,<br/>

    they are a prey to wicked desires."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time the Exalted One <span class="f2 g"><b>[114]</b></span> reproved him saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

    <p class="f4">Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

    <p class="f4">Calm your heart towards Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of dear virtues are Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the Kokālikan monk rose up from his seat,<br/>

    saluted the Exalted One,<br/>

    keeping his right side towards him,<br/>

    and departed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Not long after he had departed<br/>

    the whole body of the Kokālikan monk<br/>

    broke out with pustules<br/>

    of the size of mustard-seed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

    <p class="f4">From being of the size of mustard-seed<br/>

    they grew to the size of lentils,<br/>

    then to that of chick-peas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    then to that of kola-nut stones,<br/>

    then to the size of a jujube,<br/>

    then to that of myrobalan,<br/>

    then to that of unripe vilva fruit,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    then to that of billa fruit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having grown to that size<br/>

    they burst<br/>

    discharging pus and blood.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

    <p class="f4">And there he lay on plantain leaves,<br/>

    just like a poisoned fish.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Tudu, the individual Brahmā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    went to see the Kokālikan monk,<br/>

    and on reaching him<br/>

    stood on a cloud<br/>

    and said this to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Kokālikan,<br/>

    calm your heart towards Sāriputta and Moggallāna!</p>

    <p class="f4">Of dear virtues are Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Who are you, your reverence?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am Tudu,<br/>

    the individual Brahma."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Were you not pronounced a non-returner<br/>

    by the Exalted One?</p>

    <p class="f4">Then how is it that you come here?</p>

    <p class="f4">See how you have erred in this matter."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Tudu the individual Brahmā<br/>

    addressed the Kokālikan monk<br/>

    in these verses:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"In sooth to every man that's born<br/>

    A hatchet grows within his mouth,<br/>

    Wherewith the fool, whene'er he speaks<br/>

    And speaks amiss, doth cut himself.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[115]</b></span> Who praiseth him who should be blamed<br/>

    Or blameth who should praised be,<br/>

    He by his lips stores up ill-luck,<br/>

    And by that ill-luck finds no bliss.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Small is the ill-luck of a man<br/>

    Who gambling loseth all his wealth.<br/>

    Greater by far th' ill-luck of him<br/>

    Who, losing all and losing self,<br/>

    'Gainst the Wellfarers fouls his mind.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Whoso reviles the worthy ones,<br/>

    In speech and thought designing ill,<br/>

    For an hundred thousand periods,<br/>

    For six and thirty, with five more<br/>

    Such periods, to purgatory's doomed."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">But the Kokālikan monk<br/>

    met his end by that same sickness.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had made an end<br/>

    he rose up again in Paduma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> Purgatory,<br/>

    for hardening his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then when the night was far spent,<br/>

    the Brahmā Sahampati<br/>

    shedding radiance<br/>

    lit up Jeta Grove from end to end,<br/>

    and came to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    saluted him and stood at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus standing<br/>

    the Brahmā Sahampati said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, the Kokālikan monk has met his end,<br/>

    and having met his end<br/>

    has risen up again in Paduma Purgatory,<br/>

    for hardening his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>

    and so saying<br/>

    saluted the Exalted One,<br/>

    keeping his right side towards him,<br/>

    and vanished there and then.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">But the Exalted One,<br/>

    when that night had gone,<br/>

    addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, last night<br/>

    when night was waning<br/>

    the Brahmā <span class="f2 g"><b>[116]</b></span> Sahampati<br/>

    shedding radiance<br/>

    lit up Jeta Grove from end to end,<br/>

    and on coming to me<br/>

    saluted me and<br/>

    and stood at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus standing<br/>

    the Brahmā Sahampati said this to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sir, the Kokālikan monk has met his end,<br/>

    and having met his end<br/>

    has risen up again in Paduma Purgatory,<br/>

    for hardening his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>

    and so saying<br/>

    saluted me,<br/>

    keeping his right side towards me,<br/>

    and vanished there and then.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words a certain monk said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, how long is the measure of life in Paduma Purgatory?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Long indeed, monk, is the measure of life in Paduma Purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">It were no easy thing to reckon it thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">So many years<br/>

    or so many centuries<br/>

    or so many thousands of years<br/>

    or so many hundreds of thousands of years."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, sir, can a figure be made?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It can, monk."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One added:</p>
