    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Campā<br/>

    on the bank of the Lotus Pond at Gaggara.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the housefather Vajjiyamāhita left Campa at an early hour to see the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">But it occurred to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is not time to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    he is in retirement.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nor is it time to see the monks<br/>

    who make the mind to grow;<br/>

    those monks are in retirement.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to pay a visit<br/>

    to the Park where dwell<br/>

    the Wanderers who hold other views."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So the housefather Vajjiyamāhita drew near<br/>

    the Park where dwelt<br/>

    the Wanderers holding other views.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>

    the Wanderers holding other views,<br/>

    having come together in a great company,<br/>

    were sitting engaged in divers childish talk,<br/>

    all talking loudly,<br/>

    making a great noise and din.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when they saw the housefather Vajjiyamāhita approaching,<br/>

    while yet he was at some distance,<br/>

    they hushed each other, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Make little noise, your reverence!</p>

    <p class="f4">Make no noise, your reverence!</p>

    <p class="f4">Here comes the housefather Vajjiyamāhita,<br/>

    a disciple of Gotama the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">This housefather Vajjiyamāhita<br/>

    is one of those disciples of Gotama the recluse,<br/>

    householders clad in white,<br/>

    who live at Campā.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now those worthies are fond of little noise,<br/>

    they are schooled to little noise,<br/>

    they speak in praise of little noise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Maybe, if he sees our company making little noise,<br/>

    he will think it worth his while to draw near."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2">[190]</span> So those Wanderers kept silence.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">So the housefather Vajjiyamāhita drew near to those Wanderers,<br/>

    and on coming to them<br/>

    greeted them courteously,<br/>

    and after courteous greetings<br/>

    and reminiscent talk<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[131]</b></span> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>

    those Wanderers holding other views said this to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is it true, housefather,<br/>

    as it is said,<br/>

    that Gotama the recluse blames all ascetic ways,<br/>

    that he downright upbraids and reproaches<br/>

    every ascetic who lives the hard life?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"No indeed, sirs,<br/>

    the Exalted One blames not all ascetic ways,<br/>

    nor does he downright upbraid and reproach<br/>

    every ascetic who lives the hard life.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One, sirs,<br/>

    blames the blameworthy,<br/>

    praises the praiseworthy.</p>

    <p class="f4">In so doing the Exalted One is a particularizer;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    that Exalted One is not one<br/>

    who makes sweeping assertions herein."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words a certain Wanderer said this to the housefather Vajjiyamāhita:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Stay thou, housefather!</p>

    <p class="f4">That Gotama the recluse,<br/>

    whose praises you utter,<br/>

    is a nihilist,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    one who defines nothing as certain."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Nay, sir, herein I speak with good reason.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One has thus defined:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is good;<br/>

    that is bad.'</p>

    <p class="f4">By thus defining good and bad<br/>

    the Exalted One is a definer.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is no nihilist,<br/>

    not one who defines nothing as certain."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2">[191]</span>At these words those Wanderers were silent,<br/>

    were confounded,<br/>

    hung the head,<br/>

    looked downwards,<br/>

    were disappointed,<br/>

    and sat unable to make reply.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the housefather Vajjiyamāhita,<br/>

    seeing that those Wanderers were confounded,<br/>

    hung the head,<br/>

    looked downwards,<br/>

    were disappointed,<br/>

    and sat unable to make reply,<br/>

    rose up from his seat<br/>

    rose up from his seat<br/>

    and went to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him,<br/>

    saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he related<br/>

    all the conversation he had had<br/>

    with the Wanderers holding other views.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well done, housefather!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well done, housefather!</p>

    <p class="f4">Even <span class="f2 g"><b>[132]</b></span> thus reasonably<br/>

    are infatuated people<br/>

    from time to time<br/>

    to be confuted and rebuked by you.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, housefather,<br/>

    I say not that all ascetic ways are to be pursued.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet do I not say<br/>

    that all ascetic ways are not to be pursued.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">I say not that every undertaking,<br/>

    that every effort in training<br/>

    should be undertaken and made.</p>

    that every effort in training<br/>

    should not be undertaken and made.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">I say not, housefather,<br/>

    that every renunciation should be made,<br/>

    nor yet that it should not be made.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">I say not that every form of release<br/>

    is to be regarded as such,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    nor yet that it should not be so regarded.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">If, housefather, in one practising austerities<br/>

    <p class="f4">If in one who regards himself as released<br/>

    by a certain form of release,<br/>

    unprofitable states wax<br/>

    such release should not be regarded as such, I declare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the housefather Vajjiyamāhita,<br/>

    being thus instructed,<br/>

    stirred,<br/>

    fired<br/>

    and gladdened by the Exalted One,<br/>

    rose up from his seat,<br/>

    saluted the Exalted One by keeping his right side towards him<br/>

    and departed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Not long after he had gone<br/>

    the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, any monk who had been for a long time<br/>

    stained with but few faults<br/>

    in this Dhamma-discipline<br/>

    might reasonably<br/>

    from time to time<br/>

    confute and rebuke<br/>

    the Wanderers holding other views,<br/>

    even as they have been confuted<br/>

    by the housefather Vajjiyamāhita."</p>
