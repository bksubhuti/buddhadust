    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once on a time the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of ten<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> qualities a monk is worshipful,<br/>

    worthy of honour,<br/>

    worthy of offerings,<br/>

    worthy of being saluted with clasped hands,<br/>

    a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">What ten qualities?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk is virtuous,<br/>

    he dwells restrained with the restraint of the obligation,<br/>

    well equipped in range of practice,<br/>

    seeing grounds for fear in minutest faults,<br/>

    he takes up and trains himself<br/>

    in the training of the precepts.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again a monk has heard much;<br/>

    he bears in mind what he has heard,<br/>

    he stores up what he has heard.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2">[199]</span>Whatsoever teachings,<br/>

    lovely at the beginning,<br/>

    lovely midway,<br/>

    lovely at the end (of life),<br/>

    in spirit and in letter<br/>

    do stress the brahma-life<br/>

    in its all-round fullness<br/>

    and utter purity,<br/>

    such teachings are much heard by him,<br/>

    borne in mind,<br/>

    repeated aloud,<br/>

    pondered<br/>

    and well penetrated by vision.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again a monk has a friendship with the lovely,<br/>

    fellowship with the lovely,<br/>

    companionship with the lovely.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is one who has right view,<br/>

    he is possessed of right seeing.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Also he enjoys divers sorts of more-power:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">manifest or invisible<br/>

    he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/>

    through a rampart,<br/>

    through a mountain,<br/>

    as if through air:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

    <p class="f4">he plunges into the earth<br/>

    and shoots up again<br/>

    as if in water;</p>

    <p class="f4">he walks upon the water<br/>

    without parting it,<br/>

    as if on solid ground;</p>

    <p class="f4">he travels through the air<br/>

    sitting cross-legged,<br/>

    like a bird upon the wing;</p>

    <p class="f4">even this moon and sun,<br/>

    though of such mighty power<br/>

    he has power with his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">With the deva-power of hearing,<br/>

    purified and surpassing that of men,<br/>

    he can hear sound both of devas and of humans,<br/>

    whether far or near.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He comes to know the minds of other beings,<br/>

    of other persons,<br/>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He calls to mind his former dwelling in divers ways, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise the divers folding up of aeons,<br/>

    the divers unfolding of aeons,<br/>

    the divers folding-unfolding of aeons.</p>

    <p class="f4">(remembering):</p>

    <p class="f4">'At that time I had such a name,<br/>

    <p class="f4">As that one,<br/>
