    <h1>The Elder Monk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once on a time the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of ten qualities<br/>

    an elder monk, in whatever quarter he may live,<br/>

    lives happily.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the ten?</p>

    <p class="f4">An elder monk has seen many a day pass,<br/>

    has long ago gone forth,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is virtuous,<br/>

    he dwells restrained<br/>

    with the restraint of the obligation,<br/>

    well equipped in range of practice,<br/>

    seeing grounds for fear in minutest faults,<br/>

    he takes up and trains himself<br/>

    in the training of the precepts.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again he has heard much;<br/>

    he bears in mind what he has heard,<br/>

    he stores up what he has heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever teachings,<br/>

    lovely at the beginning,<br/>

    lovely midway,<br/>

    lovely at the end (of life),<br/>

    in spirit and in letter<br/>

    do stress the brahma-life<br/>

    in its all-round fullness<br/>

    and utter purity,<br/>

    such teachings are much heard by him,<br/>

    borne in mind,<br/>

    repeated aloud,<br/>

    pondered<br/>

    and well penetrated by vision.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover by him both of the obligations in full<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    are thoroughly learned by heart<br/>

    and well analyzed,<br/>

    with full knowledge of the meaning,<br/>

    clearly divided sutta by sutta<br/>

    and in minute detail.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is skilled in the rise and settlement of disputes.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He delights in Dhamma,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    is pleasant to converse with,<br/>

    he rejoices exceedingly in further Dhamma<br/>

    and further discipline.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is content with whatsoever supply<br/>

    of robe and alms-food,<br/>

    of seat and lodging,<br/>

    of medicines and comforts in sickness<br/>

    he may get.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is charming<br/>

    and perfectly composed<br/>

    in his goings out<br/>

    and his comings in,<br/>

    and when he sits down in the house.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He wins at pleasure,<br/>

    without effort,<br/>

    without stint,<br/>

    the four stages of musing<br/>

    which are of the clear consciousness,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    which are concerned with the happy life<br/>

    in this same visible state.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">By destroying the cankers<br/>

    in this same visible state,<br/>

    thoroughly comprehending the heart's release,<br/>

    the release by insight,<br/>

    he realizes,<br/>

    attains it<br/>

    and dwells therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">With these ten qualities<br/>

    an elder monk lives happily<br/>

    wherever he may be.</p>
