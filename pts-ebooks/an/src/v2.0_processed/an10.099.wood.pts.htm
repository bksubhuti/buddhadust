    <h1>Upāli</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br/>

    at Jeta Grove,<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Upāli came to see the Exalted One<br/>

    and on coming to him saluted him<br/>

    and sat down at one side<br/>

    seated <span class="f2">[202]</span> at one side he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, I desire to frequent woodland haunts in the forest,<br/>

    to be a lodger in solitude."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Upāli, to frequent woodland haunts in the forest<br/>

    and to be a lodger in solitude<br/>

    are things hard to compass.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">A hard thing it is to dwell secluded;<br/>

    it is hard to find delight in living alone;<br/>

    the woods strain the mind,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> methinks,<br/>

    of a monk who has not won concentration of mind.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso, Upāli, should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Though I have not won concentration of mind,<br/>

    yet I will frequent woodland haunts in the forest,<br/>

    I will be a lodger in solitude,'</p>

    <p class="f4">of him it is to be expected<br/>

    that either he will sink to the bottom<br/>

    or float on the surface.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, Upāli, a great pool of water.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then comes a bull elephant<br/>

    seven<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> or eight cubits<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> in height.</p>

    <p class="f4">He thinks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Suppose I plunge into this pool of water<br/>

    and amuse myself with the sport<br/>

    of squirting water into my ears<br/>

    or over my back.</p>

    <p class="f4">When I have enjoyed this sport<br/>

    and washed<br/>

    and drunk<br/>

    and come out again,<br/>

    suppose I go whithersoever it pleases me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So in he goes and does so,<br/>

    comes out again<br/>

    and goes whithersoever it pleases him.</p>

    <p class="f4">How can he do it?</p>

    <p class="f4">The great bulk of his person, Upāli,<br/>

    finds a footing in deep water.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2">[203]</span> But suppose a hare<br/>

    or a cat<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    should come and say to itself:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What difference is there between myself<br/>

    and a bull elephant?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I plunge into this pool of water<br/>

    and amuse myself with the sport<br/>

    of squirting water into my ears<br/>

    or over my back?</p>

    <p class="f4">When I have enjoyed this sport<br/>

    and washed<br/>

    and drunk<br/>

    and come out again,<br/>

    suppose I go whithersoever it pleases me?'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span> So he springs into that pool of water hastily<br/>

    and without consideration.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then this is to be expected of him:<br/>

    either he will sink to the bottom<br/>

    or float on the surface.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">The smallness of his person, Upāli,<br/>

    finds no footing in deep water.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Just in the same way, Upāli,<br/>

    whoso should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Though I have not won concentration of mind,<br/>

    yet I will frequent woodland haunts in the forest,<br/>

    I will be a lodger in solitude' -</p>

    <p class="f4">of him it is to be expected<br/>

    that either he will sink to the bottom<br/>

    or float on the surface.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Upāli,<br/>

    suppose a tender boy-child,<br/>

    feeble<br/>

    and lying on his back<br/>

    and playing with his own excrements.</p>

    <p class="f4">What think you, Upāli?</p>

    <p class="f4">Does not this childish sport<br/>

    come to completion and fullness?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It does, sir."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, Upāli,<br/>

    that boy-child<br/>

    on another occasion,<br/>

    when he has grown older,<br/>

    following on the ripening of the sense-faculties,<br/>

    plays with whatever may be the playthings of such children,<br/>

    such as a toy-plough,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

    tip-cat,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    somersaults,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> windmills,<br/>

    leaf-pannikins,<br/>

    toy-carts<br/>

    and toy-bows.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, Upāli?</p>

    <p class="f4">Does not this game<br/>

    come to be finer<br/>

    and more valued<br/>

    than the former?</p>

    <p class="f4">"It does, sir."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, Upāli,<br/>

    that child later on,<br/>

    when he has grown older<br/>

    owing to the ripening of his sense-faculties,<br/>

    and has come into possession<br/>

    of the five sense-pleasures<br/>

    and is possessed by them,<br/>

    he becomes a prey to them,<br/>

    to objects cognizable by the eye,<br/>

    objects desirable,<br/>

    agreeable,<br/>

    fascinating,<br/>

    attractive:<br/>

    to sounds cognizable by the ear<br/>

    to odours cognizable by the nose,<br/>

    tastes cognizable by the tongue,<br/>

    <span class="f2">[204]</span> touches cognizable by the body,<br/>

    things concerned with sensual desires<br/>

    and passionate.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what <span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span> think you, Upāli?</p>

    <p class="f4">Does not this game<br/>

    come to be finer<br/>

    and more valuable<br/>

    than the former?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It does, sir."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now look you,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> Upāli.</p>

    <p class="f4">A Wayfarer arises in the world,<br/>

    an arahant,<br/>

    one rightly enlightened,<br/>

    perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>

    a Wellfarer,<br/>

    world-knower,<br/>

    an unsurpassed trainer of men who can be trained,<br/>

    a teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>

    an awakened one,<br/>

    an Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He makes known this world,<br/>

    with its Devas,<br/>

    its Brahmas,<br/>

    its recluses and brahmins,<br/>

    its host of devas and mankind,<br/>

    himself realizing it<br/>

    by his own comprehension.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He teaches dhamma,<br/>

    lovely in the beginning,<br/>

    lovely midway,<br/>

    lovely at the end (of life),<br/>

    both in its meaning<br/>

    and its letter;<br/>

    he shows forth the Brahma-life<br/>

    utterly fulfilled<br/>

    and purified.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a housefather<br/>

    or housefather's son<br/>

    or one reborn in some family or other<br/>

    hears that dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">On hearing that dhamma<br/>

    he wins faith in the Wayfarer.</p>

    <p class="f4">In possession of that faith<br/>

    which he has won<br/>

    he ponders thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Oppressive is the home-life,<br/>

    a way of dust!</p>

    <p class="f4">The way of going forth<br/>

    is of the open air.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is no easy thing<br/>

    for one living the household life<br/>

    to practise the Brahma-life<br/>

    in all its completeness,<br/>

    in utter purity<br/>

    like a polished shell.</p>

    <p class="f4">How if I were to get the hair of my beard shorn and,<br/>

    donning the saffron robe,<br/>

    were to go forth from home<br/>

    to the homeless?'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he, some time later on,<br/>

    abandoning the whole mass of his wealth<br/>

    whether small or great,<br/>

    abandoning his circle of kinsmen<br/>

    whether small or great,<br/>

    gets the hair of his beard shorn,<br/>

    dons the saffron robes<br/>

    and goes forth from home<br/>

    to the homeless.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He, having thus gone forth,<br/>

    having entered upon the way of life<br/>

    in the training followed by the monks,<br/>

    abandoning the slaying of creatures<br/>

    abstains therefrom.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He lives as one<br/>

    who has laid down the rod,<br/>

    who has laid down the knife,<br/>

    who has scruples;<br/>

    he is kind<br/>

    and has compassion<br/>

    for every living thing.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning the taking of what is not given<br/>

    he abstains therefrom.</p>

    <p class="f4">He lives as one<br/>

    who takes only what is given,<br/>

    who waits for what is given;<br/>

    he lives with a self that <span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span> has become pure,<br/>

    not by stealth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning the unchaste life<br/>

    he lives chaste,<br/>

    lives a life aloof,<br/>

    abstaining from the sexual act,<br/>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning falsehood<br/>

    he abstains therefrom;<br/>

    he speaks the truth,<br/>

    joins truth to truth,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>

    unswerving,<br/>

    reliable,<br/>

    no deceiver of the world.</p>

    he abstains therefrom.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he hears something at another place<br/>

    he spreads it not abroad elsewhere<br/>

    to cause dissension among those folk.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he reconciles those who are at variance<br/>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning bitter speech<br/>

    he abstains therefrom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever speech is blameless,<br/>

    pleasing to the ear,<br/>

    affectionate,<br/>

    speech that goes to the heart,<br/>

    is urbane,<br/>

    delights many folk -<br/>

    such speech does he utter.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning idle babble<br/>

    he abstains therefrom.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is one who speaks in season,<br/>

    speaks of facts,<br/>

    speaks according to the discipline.</p>
