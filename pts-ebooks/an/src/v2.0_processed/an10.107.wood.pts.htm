    <h1>The Ablution</h1>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, in the southern districts<br/>

    there is an ablution.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion<br/>

    there are food and drink,<br/>

    food soft and hard,<br/>

    syrups and drinks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    dancing,<br/>

    singing<br/>

    and music of instruments.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, this is just a wiping,<br/>

    not a wiping out,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">For that ablution is low,<br/>

    common,<br/>

    vulgar,<br/>

    unariyan,<br/>

    not bringing profit;<br/>

    it conduces not to revulsion,<br/>

    to fading,<br/>

    to ending,<br/>

    to calming,<br/>

    to comprehension<br/>

    and illumination,<br/>

    it conduces not to nibbāna.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, I will teach you<br/>

    the Ariyan ablution,<br/>

    a washing which conduces to downright revulsion,<br/>

    fading,<br/>

    ending,<br/>

    calming,<br/>

    comprehension,<br/>

    illumination,<br/>

    which conduces to nibbāna -<br/>

    an ablution whereby beings<br/>

    whose nature it is to be reborn<br/>

    are released from rebirth;<br/>

    whereby beings whose nature it is to decay<br/>

    are released from decay;<br/>

    whereby beings whose nature it is to die<br/>

    are released from death;<br/>

    whereby beings to whom belong sorrow and lamentation,<br/>

    woe,<br/>

    dejection<br/>

    and despair,<br/>

    are released from<br/>

    sorrow and lamentation,<br/>

    woe,<br/>

    dejection<br/>

    and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it attentively and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"We will, sir," replied those monks to the Exalted One,<br/>

    who said:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is that Ariyan ablution,<br/>

    a washing which conduces to downright revulsion,<br/>
