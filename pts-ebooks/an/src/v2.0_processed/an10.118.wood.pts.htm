    <h1>Hither and Further Shore (a)</h1>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you the hither shore<br/>

    and the further shore.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen attentively.</p>

    <p class="f4">Apply your minds and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"We will, sir," replied those monks to the Exalted One, who said:</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"And what, monks, is the hither shore<br/>

    and what is the further shore?</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong view, monks, is the hither shore,<br/>

    right view the further shore.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong thinking is the hither shore,<br/>

    right thinking the further shore.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong speech is the hither shore,<br/>

    right speech the further shore.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong action is the hither shore,<br/>

    right action the further shore.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong living is the hither shore,<br/>

    right living the further shore.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong effort is the hither shore,<br/>

    right effort the further shore.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong mindfulness is the hither shore,<br/>

    right mindfulness the further shore.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong concentration is the hither shore,<br/>

    right concentration the further shore.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong knowledge is the hither shore,<br/>

    right knowledge the further shore.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong release is the hither shore,<br/>

    right knowledge the further shore.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the hither shore:<br/>

    that is the further shore."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Few are they of mortal men<br/>

    Who have reached the further shore;<br/>

    But the crowd of other folk<br/>

    On this side fare up and down.<br/>

    When dhamma rightly is revealed,<br/>

    Who by dhamma fare along,<br/>

    They shall reach the shore and pass<br/>

    The realm of death so hard to cross.<br/>

    Giving up the state of darkness<br/>

    Let the wise pursue the light.<br/>

    Giving up home for the homeless,<br/>

    In solitude where joys are rare,<br/>

    Let him long for bliss unbounded.<br/>

    Leaving lusts and owning naught<br/>

    Let the wise man cleanse himself<br/>

    From the passions of the heart.<br/>

    They who in the limbs of wisdom<br/>

    Rightly make the mind to grow,<br/>

    Glad to have surrendered clinging,<br/>

    Glad to be from grasping free,<br/>

    Canker-cured they, all-resplendent<br/>

    I' the world are quenchèd utterly.'</p>
