    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi,<br/>

    the day being the sabbath,<br/>

    having washed his head<br/>

    and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br/>

    holding a handful of wet <i>kusa</i> grass,<br/>

    was standing aside<br/>

    not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One saw the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi<br/>

    this sabbath day,<br/>

    having washed his head<br/>

    and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br/>

    thus standing aside<br/>

    holding a handful of wet hum grass,<br/>

    and on seeing him said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"How is it, brāhmin, that you<br/>

    on this sabbath day,<br/>

    having washed your head<br/>

    and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br/>

    thus stand aside<br/>

    holding a handful of wet hum grass?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Today, Master Gotama,<br/>

    is the (ceremony of) descent<br/>

    of the brāhmin clan."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"In what manner, brāhmin,<br/>

    is this descent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, Master Gotama,<br/>

    it being the sabbath,<br/>

    brāhmins wash the head,<br/>

    put on a fresh pair of cloths,<br/>

    smear the floor with wet cowdung,<br/>

    strew it with wet husa grass,<br/>

    and make their bed<br/>

    between the boundary and the fire-house.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rising up thrice in that night,<br/>

    with clasped hands<br/>

    they do homage to fire,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'We come down to your worship,<br/>

    we come down to your worship!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then they feed the fire<br/>

    with oblation of oil<br/>

    of butter<br/>

    and fresh butter.</p>

    <p class="f4">When the night has passed<br/>

    they feed brāhmins<br/>

    with choice food<br/>

    both hard and soft.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Master Gotama,<br/>

    is the descent of the brāhmins."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brāhmin, the descent (ceremony) of the brāhmins is one thing,<br/>

    the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan<br/>

    is quite another thing."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, Master Gotama,<br/>

    in what way is the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan done?</p>

    <p class="f4">Well for me<br/>

    if the worthy Gotama would teach me dhamma<br/>

    as to the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, brāhmin, do you listen."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will, master,"<br/>

    replied the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to the Exalted One,<br/>

    who said:</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"In this matter, brāhmin, the Ariyan disciple thus ponders:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Of the act of taking life<br/>

    the ripening is evil<br/>

    both in this same visible state<br/>

    and in that to come.'</p>

    he descends from taking what is not given.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Of wrong conduct in things sexual<br/>

    the ripening is evil<br/>

    <p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>

    he abandons wrong conduct in things sexual,<br/>

    he descends from wrong conduct in things sexual.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Of falsehood<br/>

    the ripening is evil<br/>

    he descends from falsehood.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Of spiteful speech<br/>

    the ripening is evil<br/>

    both in this same visible state<br/>

    <p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>

    he abandons spiteful speech,<br/>

    he descends from spiteful speech.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Of bitter speech<br/>

    the ripening is evil<br/>

    both in this same visible state<br/>

    <p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>

    he abandons bitter speech,<br/>

    he descends from bitter speech.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Of idle babble<br/>

    the ripening is evil<br/>

    both in this same visible state<br/>

    and in that to come.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>

    he abandons idle babble,<br/>

    he descends from idle babble.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Of coveting<br/>

    the ripening is evil<br/>

    both in this same visible state<br/>

    <p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>

    he abandons coveting,<br/>

    he descends from coveting.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Of harmfulness<br/>

    the ripening is evil<br/>

    both in this same visible state<br/>

    <p class="f4">Thus pondering<br/>

    he abandons wrong view,<br/>

    he descends from wrong view.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, brāhmin, is the descent<br/>

    by the discipline of the Ariyan."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed, Master Gotama,<br/>

    one thing is the descent of the brāhmins,<br/>

    quite another thing is the descent<br/>

    by the discipline of the Ariyan.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why, Master Gotama,<br/>

    compared with the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan<br/>

    that of the brāhmins is not worth one sixteenth part of it.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span> It is excellent, Master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is excellent, Master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is as if one should raise the fallen,<br/>

    open up the hidden,<br/>

    point out the way<br/>

    to one gone astray,<br/>

    hold up a shining light<br/>

    so that they who have eyes<br/>

    may see objects.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus has dhamma been expounded in divers ways by the worthy Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">I myself, worthy Gotama,<br/>

    do go for resort to the awakened one,<br/>

    to dhamma<br/>

    and to the order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let the worthy Gotama reckon me as a lay-follower<br/>

    from this day forth,<br/>

    so long as life shall last,<br/>

    as one who has gone to him as resort."</p>
