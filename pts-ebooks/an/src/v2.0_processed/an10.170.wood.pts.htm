    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you the hither shore<br/>

    and the further shore.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen attentively.</p>

    <p class="f4">Apply your minds and I will speak."</p>

    Who have reached the further shore;<br/>

    But the crowd of other folk<br/>

    On this side fare up and down.<br/>

    When dhamma rightly is revealed,<br/>

    Who by dhamma fare along,<br/>

    They shall reach the shore and pass<br/>

    The realm of death so hard to cross.<br/>

    Giving up the state of darkness<br/>

    Let the wise pursue the light.<br/>

    Giving up home for the homeless,<br/>

    In solitude where joys are rare,<br/>

    Let him long for bliss unbounded.<br/>

    Leaving lusts and owning naught<br/>

    Let the wise man cleanse himself<br/>

    From the passions of the heart.<br/>

    They who in the limbs of wisdom<br/>

    Rightly make the mind to grow,<br/>

    Glad to have surrendered clinging,<br/>

    Glad to be from grasping free,<br/>

    Canker-cured they, all-resplendent<br/>

    I' the world are quenchèd utterly.'</p>
