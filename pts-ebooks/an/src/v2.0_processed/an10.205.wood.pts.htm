    <h1>Dhamma-Teaching on Crookedness</h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p><span class="f2">[288]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bodh]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you dhamma-teaching,<br/>

    dhamma-teaching on crookedness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pay attention carefully and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span> "We will, sir," replied those monks to the Exalted One,<br/>

    who said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"And what, monks, is dhamma-teaching which teaches about crookedness?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, beings are responsible for their deeds,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    heirs to their deeds,<br/>

    they are the womb of their deeds,<br/>

    kinsmen of their deeds,<br/>

    to them their deeds come home again.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever deed they do,<br/>

    be it lovely or ugly,<br/>

    of that thing they are the heirs.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">In this connexion, monks,<br/>

    a certain one takes life,<br/>

    he is a hunter,<br/>

    bloody-handed,<br/>

    given over to killing and slaying,<br/>

    void of compassion to all living creatures.</p>

    <p class="f4">He goes crookedly<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> in body,<br/>

    crookedly in speech,<br/>

    crookedly in mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">His action with body is crooked,<br/>

    so is that with speech and mind;<br/>

    crooked is his bourn<br/>

    and crooked his rising up again in birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks,<br/>

    for one whose bourn is crooked,<br/>

    whose rebirth is crooked,<br/>

    for him there is one of two bourns,<br/>

    either downright woe in purgatory<br/>

    or to be born in the womb of an animal,<br/>

    one that creeps crookedly along.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>

    is that birth in the womb of an animal,<br/>

    one that creeps crookedly along?</p>

    <p class="f4">A snake,<br/>

    a scorpion,<br/>

    a centipede,<br/>

    a mongoose,<br/>

    a cat,<br/>

    a mouse,<br/>

    an owl<br/>

    or whatsoever other animal<br/>

    goes stealthily on seeing human beings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">A certain one takes what is not given;<br/>

    he takes with thievish intent<br/>

    things not given to him,<br/>

    the property of another person,<br/>

    situated in jungle<br/>

    or in village.</p>

    <p class="f4">In sexual desires<br/>

    he is a wrong-doer;<br/>

    he has intercourse with girls in ward of mother or father,<br/>

    brother,<br/>

    sister<br/>

    or relatives (or clan);<br/>

    with girls lawfully guarded,<br/>

    already pledged to a husband<br/>

    and protected by the rod,<br/>

    even with girls crowned with the flower-garland (of betrothal).</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is a liar.</p>

    <p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br/>

    or a company<br/>

    or amid his relatives<br/>

    or guild-men<br/>

    or before the royal family<br/>

    and asked to bear witness<br/>

    with the words:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, good fellow!<br/>

    Say what you know.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he knows not, he says, 'I know';<br/>

    though he knows, he says, 'I know not';<br/>

    though he has not seen, he says 'I saw';<br/>

    though he saw, he says 'I saw not'.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus for his own sake<br/>

    or that of others<br/>

    or to get some carnal profit or other<br/>

    he deliberately utters falsehood.</p>

    <p class="f4">a slanderer,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Also he is a slanderer.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing something at one place<br/>

    he proclaims it somewhere else<br/>

    to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br/>

    what he has heard here<br/>

    he repeats there<br/>

    to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he breaks up harmony,<br/>

    foments strife between those discordant,<br/>

    discord is his delight;<br/>

    exulting in<br/>

    and passionately fond of discord,<br/>

    he utters speech<br/>

    that makes for discord.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Also he is of harsh speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is rough,<br/>

    cutting,<br/>

    bitter about others,<br/>

    abusive of others,<br/>

    provoking wrath<br/>

    and conducive to distraction -<br/>

    such speech does he utter.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is given to idle babble,<br/>

    he speaks out of season,<br/>

    speaks unrealities;<br/>

    he speaks things unprofitable,<br/>

    what is not-dhamma<br/>

    and not-discipline;<br/>

    he utters speech not worth treasuring up,<br/>

    speech unreasonable<br/>

    and not worth listening to,<br/>

    undiscriminating<br/>

    and unconcerned with profit.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is covetous,<br/>

    he is one who covets the property of another,<br/>

    thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'O that what is another's were mine!'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He is malevolent of heart,<br/>

    the thoughts of his heart are corrupt, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let these beings be slain,<br/>

    come to destruction,<br/>

    be destroyed,<br/>

    not exist at all.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Also he has wrong view,<br/>

    he is perverse in outlook,<br/>

    holding:</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no gift,<br/>

    no offering,<br/>

    no sacrifice;<br/>

    there is no fruit or ripening of deeds<br/>

    well done or ill done;<br/>

    this world is not,<br/>

    the world beyond is not;<br/>

    there is no mother,<br/>

    no father,<br/>

    no beings supernaturally born;<br/>

    there are no recluses and brāhmins in the world<br/>

    who have gone right,<br/>

    who fare rightly,<br/>

    men who by their own comprehension<br/>

    have realized this world<br/>

    and the world beyond<br/>

    and thus declare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He goes crookedly in body,<br/>

    crookedly in speech,<br/>

    crookedly in mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">His action with body is crooked,<br/>

    so is that with speech and mind;<br/>

    crooked is his bourn<br/>

    and crooked his rising up again in birth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks,<br/>

    <p class="f4">A snake,<br/>

    a scorpion,<br/>

    a centipede,<br/>

    a mongoose,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span> a cat,<br/>

    a mouse,<br/>

    goes stealthily on seeing human beings.</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, beings are responsible for their deeds,<br/>

    heirs to their deeds,<br/>

    the kinsmen of their deeds,<br/>

    to them their deeds come home again.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever deed they do,<br/>

    be it lovely or ugly,<br/>

    of that they are the heirs.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a certain one abandons taking life,<br/>

    abstains therefrom;<br/>

    he has laid aside the rod,<br/>

    has laid aside the knife;<br/>

    he dwells modest,<br/>

    charitable,<br/>

    feeling compassion towards every living creature.</p>

    <p class="f4">He goes not crookedly in body,<br/>

    speech and mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">His action with body,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and mind is straight;<br/>

    straightforward is his bourn<br/>

    and straight his rebirth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, for one whose bourn and rebirth are straight<br/>

    I declare one of two bourns,<br/>

    either those heaven-worlds<br/>

    that are utter bliss<br/>

    or (rebirth in) whatsoever families are exalted,<br/>

    such as the families of nobles<br/>

    or brāhmins,<br/>

    or housefathers of a great household,<br/>

    wealthy,<br/>

    of great resources,<br/>

    of great property,<br/>

    with great store of gold and silver,<br/>

    with great store of possessions,<br/>

    with great store of wealth and grain.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus become, monks,<br/>

    is the rebirth of one who has come to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">What he does,<br/>

    by that he is reborn;<br/>

    when reborn (appropriate) contacts<br/>

    contact such an one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus I declare that beings are the heirs of their deeds.</p>

    delightful to many folk,<br/>

    of such speech he is a speaker.</p>

    he utters speech worth treasuring up,<br/>
