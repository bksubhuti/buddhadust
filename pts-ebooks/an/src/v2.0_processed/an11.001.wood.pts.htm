    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"><b>[311]</b> [1][than][olds]</span> Now the venerable Ānanda came to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>

    what is the profit<br/>

    of good conduct?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, Ānanda, freedom from remorse<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is the object,<br/>

    freedom from remorse is the profit<br/>

    of good conduct."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>

    what is the profit<br/>

    of freedom from remorse?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Joy, Ānanda, is the object,<br/>

    joy is the profit<br/>

    of freedom from remorse."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>

    what is the profit<br/>

    of joy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Rapture, Ānanda, is the object,<br/>

    rapture is the profit<br/>

    of joy."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>

    what is the profit<br/>

    of rapture?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Calm, Ānanda, is the object,<br/>

    calm is the profit<br/>

    of rapture."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Happiness, Ānanda, is the object,<br/>

    happiness is the profit<br/>

    of calm."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>

    what is the profit<br/>

    of happiness?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Concentration,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> Ānanda, is the object,<br/>

    concentration is the profit<br/>

    of happiness."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>

    what is the profit<br/>

    of concentration?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Knowing and seeing things as they really are, Ānanda, is the object<br/>

    knowing and seeing things as they really are is the profit<br/>

    of concentration."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>

    what is the profit<br/>

    of knowing and seeing things as they really are?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revulsion, Ānanda, is the object<br/>

    revulsion is the profit<br/>

    of knowing and seeing things as they really are."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>

    what is the profit<br/>

    of revulsion?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fading of interest, Ānanda, is the object<br/>

    fading of interest is the profit<br/>

    of revulsion."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, what is the object,<br/>

    what is the profit<br/>

    of fading of interest?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Release by knowing and seeing, Ānanda, is the object<br/>

    relese by knowing and seeing is the profit<br/>

    of fading of interest.</p>

    <p class="f4">So you see, Ānanda, good conduct<br/>

    has freedom from remorse as object and profit;<br/>

    freedom from remorse has joy;<br/>

    joy has rapture;<br/>

    rapture has calm;<br/>

    calm has happiness;<br/>

    happiness has concentration;<br/>

    concentration has seeing things as they really are;<br/>

    seeing things as they really are has revulsion;<br/>

    revulsion has fading interest;<br/>

    and fading of interest has release by knowing and seeing as their object and profit.</p>

    <p class="f4">So you see, Ānanda, good conduct leads gradually up to the summit."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Nissāya</i> is the name given to this chapter, from the frequent occurrence of the word in §9. Text wrongly prints <i>nissaya</i> (pupillage), the name of a sutta of the Tens, No. 34.</p>

    <p class="f2">The following footnotes from AN 10.1</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Kim-atthiyaṇ.</i> It is not easy to translate this, the adjective of <i>attha</i> (<i>cf.</i> <i>G.S.</i> iv, pp. vii, x, xix). The root-idea is 'thing-sought,' or '-needed,' and so 'aimed at.' This is well shown in the much-used parable of the man <i>sār-atthiko (-ika=iya),</i> 'seeking (or needing) timber': see below again, p. 201 [here]; also five times in the <i>Majjhima</i> and four times in <i>K.S.</i> The 'forward view' in the contexts makes such a term as 'of what use' not quite so suitable.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Sīlāni</i> (good conduct) is more literally habits, then, moral habits. The English words have too wide and deep a range.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Avippaṭisāro;</i> cf. <i>D.</i> i, 73; <i>S.</i> iv, 351; <i>A.</i> iii, 21 = <i>G.S.</i> iii, 16. In the Elevens [Here} the same set is made into eleven by taking revulsion-and-fading as two terms.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Samādhi.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Anupubbena aggāya parenti; cf.</i> <i>S.</i> ii. 20, <i>ucchedaṇ pareti;</i> below, pp. 139, 312 of text (<i>hānāya</i>). Comy. <i>arahattāya gacchanti.</i> Cf. with this sequence that in <i>K.S.</i> ii. 26 (XII, § 27), and p. viii.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Adapted from AN 10 1. Woodward notes: "This sutta is exactly the same as No. 1 of this volume [GS V], except that one of the ten qualities <i>'nibbidā-virāga'</i> is here divided so as to make eleven."</p>
