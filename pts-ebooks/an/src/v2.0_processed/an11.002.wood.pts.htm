    freedom from remorse arises.</p>

    — that for one who is joyous<br/>

    rapture arises. </p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, for one whose heart is enraptured<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    there is no need for the purposeful thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'May my body be calmed.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is in accordance with nature<br/>

    — that for one whose heart is enraptured<br/>

    the body is calmed.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is in accordance with nature<br/>

    — that one whose body is calmed<br/>

    feels happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, for one who is happy<br/>

    there is no need for the thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">It follows that the happy man's mind<br/>

    is concentrated.</p>

    there is no need for the thought:</p>

    that one concentrated does so.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, for one who knows and sees things as they really are<br/>

    there is no need for the thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I feel revulsion.'</p>

    <p class="f4">It follows naturally<br/>

    that one who knows and sees things as they really are<br/>

    feels revulsion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, for one who feels revulsion<br/>

    there is no need for the thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Interest fades in me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">It follows naturally<br/>

    that interest fades<br/>

    in ohe who feels revulsion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, for one in whom interest has faded,<br/>

    there is no need for the thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I realize release by knowing and seeing.'</p>

    <p class="f4">It follows naturally<br/>

    that he in whome interest has faded<br/>

    realizes release by knowing and seeing.</p>

    <p class="f4">So you see, monks,<br/>

    revulsion has fading of interest<br/>

    as object and profit;<br/>

    fading of interest has release by knowing and seeing<br/>

    as object and profit;<br/>

    seeing and knowing (things) as they really are,<br/>

    has fading interest<br/>

    as object and profit;<br/>

    concentration has knowing and seeing things as they really are<br/>

    as object and profit;<br/>

    happiness has concentration<br/>

    as object and profit;<br/>

    calm has happiness;<br/>

    rapture has calm;<br/>

    joy has rapture;<br/>

    freedom from remorse has joy;<br/>

    good conduct has freedom from remorse<br/>

    as its object,<br/>

    freedom from remorse as its profit.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"><b>[4]</b></span> Thus, monks, one state<br/>

    just causes another state to swell,<br/>

    one state just causes the fulfilment<br/>

    of another state,<br/>
