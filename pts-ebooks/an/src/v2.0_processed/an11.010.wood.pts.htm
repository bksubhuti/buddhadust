    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span> <span class="f2">[323]</span> Once the Exalted One was staying at Natika<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in the Brick Hall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sandha came to see the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>

    the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span> "Sandha, do you muse with the musing<br/>

    <p class="f4">Muse not with the musing<br/>

    <p class="f4">And what is the musing<br/>

    of the unbroken colt?</p>

    <p class="f4">The unbroken colt, Sandha,<br/>

    when tied up by the feeding-trough muses:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Fodder! Fodder!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">When thus tied up by the feeding-trough<br/>

    it never occurs to him:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'I wonder what task the trainer will set me today?</p>

    <p class="f4">What can I do for him in return?'</p>

    <p class="f4">But tied up there by the feeding-trough<br/>

    he just muses of fodder.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the same way, Sandha,<br/>

    a certain one here,<br/>

    an untrained man-colt,<br/>

    who has gone to the forest<br/>

    or the root of a tree<br/>

    or a lonely dwelling-place,<br/>

    lives with a heart obsessed by desire and lust,<br/>

    overwhelmed by desire and lust,<br/>

    the way out of desire and lust when they arise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Keeping desire and lust within him<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    <p class="f4">He lives with a heart obsessed by malice,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>

    overwhelmed by malice,<br/>

    and he has not come to know<br/>

    <p class="f4">Keeping malice within him<br/>

    he muses,<br/>

    he is bemused,<br/>

    he is im-mused,<br/>

    he is de-mused.</p>

    <p class="f4">He lives with a heart obsessed by sloth-and-torpor,<br/>

    overwhelmed by sloth-and-torpor,<br/>

    and he has not come to know<br/>

    the way out of sloth-and-torpor when it arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">Keeping sloth-and-torpor within him<br/>

    he muses,<br/>

    he is bemused,<br/>

    he is im-mused,<br/>

    he is de-mused.</p>

    <p class="f4">He lives with a heart obsessed by worry-and-flurry,<br/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Sandha, is the musing<br/>

    of the thoroughbred?</p>

    <p class="f4">The goodly, trained thoroughbred,<br/>

    when tied up near the feeding-trough,<br/>

    muses not thus:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span> When the goodly, trained thoroughbred, Sandha,<br/>

    <p class="f4">What return can I make to him?'</p>

    <p class="f4">He muses not on fodder always<br/>

    <p class="f4">The goodly, trained thoroughbred, Sandha,<br/>

    looks (with dread) upon the application of the goad<br/>
