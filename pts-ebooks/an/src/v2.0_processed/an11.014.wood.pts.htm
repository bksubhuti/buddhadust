    <h1>Nandiya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></h1>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds]</span> On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br/>

    at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that <span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span> occasion<br/>

    the Exalted One was desirous<br/>

    of taking up residence<br/>

    during the rainy season<br/>

    at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Nandiya the Sakyan heard it said<br/>

    that the Exalted One so desired.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2">[335]</span> Then it occurred to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose I also were to take up residence<br/>

    at Sāvatthī during the rainy season.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I could both apply myself<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to my business<br/>

    and at the same time<br/>

    get a chance of seeing the Exalted One<br/>

    from time to time."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Exalted One took up residence at Sāvatthī<br/>

    during the rainy season<br/>

    and Nandiya the Sakyan did the same.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he applied himself to his business<br/>

    and from time to time<br/>

    got a chance of seeing the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>

    a number of monks were busy<br/>

    making robes for the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"For," said they, "when the rains are over<br/>

    the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds."</p>

    <p class="f4">And Nandiya the Sakyan heard it said<br/>

    that a number of monks were busy<br/>

    making robes for the Exalted One,<br/>

    and that when the rains were over<br/>

    the Exalted One would set forth on his rounds,<br/>

    so he went to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him<br/>

    saluted the Exalted One<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard it said, sir,<br/>

    that a number of monks are busy<br/>

    making robes for the Exalted One,<br/>

    and that when the rains are over<br/>

    the Exalted One will set forth on his rounds.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, sir, among those who live in various ways,<br/>

    in whose way of living should we live?"</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well asked, Nandiya!<br/>

    Well asked, Nandiya!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is a fit thing for you clansmen<br/>

    to come to see the Wayfarer<br/>

    and ask such a question.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who means business, Nandiya,<br/>

    is a believer, not an unbeliever.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He who means business is virtuous, not immora1.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He who means business<br/>

    is of ardent energy, no sluggard.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He who means business<br/>

    has mindfulness fixed, not distracted.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He who means business<br/>

    is composed, not discomposed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He who means business<br/>

    is strong in insight, not weak in insight.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">When you have established yourself<br/>

    in these six qualities, Nandiya,<br/>

    you should set up mindfulness<br/>

    in the inner self<br/>

    in five<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> qualities.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Nandiya, you should recollect the Wayfarer thus: <span class="f2">[336]</span></p>

    <p class="f4">'The Exalted One is an arahant,<br/>

    fully enlightened,<br/>

    perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>

    a Welfarer, a world-knower,<br/>

    an unsurpassed trainer of men to be trained,<br/>

    teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>

    an awakened one,<br/>

    Exalted One is he.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on the Wayfarer<br/>

    you should set up mindfulness<br/>

    in the inner self.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect Dhamma thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well <span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span> declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma<br/>

    that is of this visible life,<br/>

    unhindered by time,<br/>

    that bids one come to see it,<br/>

    that leads onward,<br/>

    to be understood by the discerning,<br/>

    each for himself.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on Dhamma<br/>

    you should set up mindfulness<br/>

    in the inner self.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect lovely friends thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A gain to me it is indeed!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well gotten indeed by me it is,<br/>

    that I have lovely friends,<br/>

    compassionate,<br/>

    desirous of my welfare,<br/>

    who encourage and exhort me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on lovely friends<br/>

    you should set up mindfulness<br/>

    in the inner self.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect your own liberality thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A gain it is to me indeed!<br/>

    Well gotten indeed it is by me,<br/>

    that amid folk overgrown<br/>

    with the blight of stinginess<br/>

    I live at home cleansed<br/>

    of the blight of stinginess,<br/>

    openhanded, pure-handed,<br/>

    delighting in self-surrender,<br/>

    one to ask a favour of,<br/>

    rejoicing in dispensing charitable gifts.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on liberality<br/>

    you should set up mindfulness<br/>

    in the inner self.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Once more, Nandiya, you should recollect the devas thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whatsoever devas,<br/>

    passing beyond the company of those devas<br/>

    who subsist on food material,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    do rise up again in a certain mind-made body<br/>

    — such devas observe in the self<br/>

    nothing more to do,<br/>

    no need for repeating what is done.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, Nandiya,<br/>

    a monk who is definitely released<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

    observes in the self no more to do,<br/>

    observes no need for repeating <span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span> what is done,<br/>

    even so, Nandiya,<br/>

    whatsoever devas,<br/>

    passing beyond the company of those devas<br/>

    who subsist on food material,<br/>

    do rise up again in a certain mind-made body,<br/>

    — such devas observe in the self<br/>

    nothing more to do,<br/>

    no need for repeating what is done.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, fixed upon the devas<br/>

    you should cause mindfulness to arise<br/>

    in the inner self.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">So, Nandiya,<br/>

    possessing these eleven qualities<br/>

    the Ariyan disciple<br/>

    just abandons evil, unprofitable states,<br/>

    he clings not to them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, Nandiya,<br/>

    a pot upset<br/>

    pours out its water<br/>

    and cannot take it in again;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    or just as fire<br/>

    let loose in a dry grass-jungle<br/>

    goes blazing on<br/>

    and turns not back to what is burnt out,<br/>

    even so, Nandiya,<br/>

    the Ariyan disciple<br/>

    possessed of these eleven qualities<br/>

    just abandons evil, unprofitable states<br/>

    and clings not to them."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Similar advice is given to Nandiya at <i>K.S.</i> v, 340.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Text should read <i>adhiṭṭhahissāmi</i> for <i>adiṭṭha-</i>.</p>
