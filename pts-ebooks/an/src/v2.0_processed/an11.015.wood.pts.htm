    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds]</span> Now the venerable Subhūti<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    came along with a believing monk<br/>

    to see the Exalted One,<br/>

    and on coming to him saluted the Exalted One<br/>

    and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/>

    the Exalted One said this to the venerable Subhūti:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray who is this monk, Subhūti?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"He is a believer, sir.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is the son of a believing disciple<br/>

    and went forth from a believer's home<br/>

    to the homeless."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, Subhūti, does this believing monk,<br/>

    the son of a believing disciple<br/>

    who went forth from a believer's home<br/>

    to the homeless<br/>

    — does he conform<br/>

    to the traditional marks of the believer?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now is the time for this, 0 Exalted One!<br/>

    Now is the time for this, 0 Welfarer,<br/>

    for the Exalted One to tell<br/>

    the traditional marks of belief in a believer.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now I shall understand<br/>

    whether this monk does conform<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    to the traditional marks or not."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span> "Then, Subhūti, do you listen.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pay attention carefully<br/>

    and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will, sir,"<br/>

    replied the venerable Subhūti<br/>

    to the Exalted One, who said:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2">[338]</span> 'In this connexion, Subhūti,<br/>

    a monk is virtuous,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
