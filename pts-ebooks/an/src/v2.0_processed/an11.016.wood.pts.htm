    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than][piya][olds]</span> Monks, eleven advantages are to be looked for<br/>

    from the release of heart<br/>

    by the practice of amity,<br/>

    by making amity to grow,<br/>

    by making much of it,<br/>

    by making amity a vehicle and basis,<br/>

    by persisting in it,<br/>

    by becoming familiar with it,<br/>

    by well establishing it.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the eleven?</p>

    <p class="f4"><b>[1]</b> One sleeps happy<br/>

    <b>[2]</b> and wakes happy;<br/>

    <b>[3]</b> he sees no evil dream;<br/>

    <b>[4]</b> he is dear to human beings<br/>

    <b>[5]</b> and non-human beings alike;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    <b>[6]</b> the devas guard him;<br/>

    <b>[7]</b> fire, poison or sword affect him not;<br/>

    <b>[8]</b> quickly he concentrates his mind;<br/>

    <b>[9]</b> his complexion is serene;<br/>

    <b>[10]</b> he makes an end without bewilderment;<br/>

    <b>[11]</b> and if he has penetrated no further (to Arahantship)<br/>

    he reaches (at death) the Brahma-worId.</p>

    <p class="f4">These eleven advantages<br/>

    are to be looked for<br/>

    from the release of the heart<br/>

    by the practice of amity,<br/>

    by making amity to grow,<br/>

    by making much of it,<br/>

    by making amity a vehicle and basis,<br/>
