    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span> Now the venerable Sāriputta, addressed the monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"May it be the case, monks,<br/>

    that a monk's winning of concentration is of such a sort that<br/>

    in earth he is unaware of earth,<br/>

    in water unaware of water,<br/>

    in heat unaware of heat,<br/>

    in air unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br/>

    in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br/>

    that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br/>

    in the world beyond unaware of it,<br/>

    in whatsoever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br/>

    attained, searched into, pondered over by mind<br/>

    unaware of the seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br/>

    attained, searched into, pondered over by mind<br/>

    and yet at the same time he may be aware?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"We would come a long way, your reverence,<br/>

    to learn the meaning of this saying<br/>

    from the venerable Sāriputta.<br/>

    Well for us, sir, if the meaning of this saying<br/>

    were to occur to the venerable Sāriputta.<br/>

    Hearing it from the venerable Sāriputta<br/>

    the monks would bear it in mind."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">"It may be the case, monks,<br/>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, monks, a monk is conscious thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the real,<br/>
