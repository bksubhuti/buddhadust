					<p class="f4">xl. Three uprisings of desires connected with sense: (1) There are beings, friends, whose sense-desires are bound up with the objects thereof, and they are in subjection to such desire. Such are human beings, <span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span> some devas and some reborn to [one of the four] evil destinies. (2) There are beings who have desires for that which [they have] creates; such are the devas so called (Nimmānarati), who having created one thing after another are in subjection to such desires. (3) There are beings who have desires for the creations of others; and get these into their power; such are the devas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a></sup></span> so called (Paranimmita-vāsavatti).</p>

					<p class="f4">xli. Three happy rebirths:—(1) There are beings, friends, who [in a former birth] having continually produced, dwell now in happiness; such are the devas of the Brahmā group. (2) There are beings who are soaked and steeped in happiness, full of it, pervaded by it. They from time to time pour forth ecstatic utterance saying: 'Oh the bliss of it!' Ah what happiness!' Such are the Radiant Devas.<span class="f3"><sup>30</sup></span> (3) There are beings who are similarly filled with happiness ... pervaded by it; they, serenely blissful, experience only sublime <span class="f2">[219]</span> happiness. Such are the Luminous Devas.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">xliii. Other three kinds of knowledge: — knowledge that is thought out, knowledge that is learned (from another), knowledge that is gained by [cultural] development.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">xliv. Three kins of armour: — that of doctrine learnt, that of detachment,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a></sup></span> that of knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">xlix. Three supreme things, to wit, that of vision, that of procedure, that of freedom.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">l. Three species of concentration:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a></sup></span> — that of mental application followed by sustained thought, that of sustained thought without mental application, that of concentration without either.</p>

					<p class="f4">li. Other three species of concentration: — concentrative insight into 'emptiness,' 'signlessness,' 'end of baneful longing.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">lii. Three purities, to wit, of action, speech and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[220]</span> liii. Three factors of the anchorite,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a></sup></span> to wit, a certain attitude respecting conduct, respecting speech, respecting thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">lvi. Three dominant influences [on effort]: to wit, the influence of self-[criticism], the influence of the community, the influence of spiritual things.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span> lvii. Three bases of discourse, to wit (1) discourse may be concerned with the past: — 'Such things were in the past'; (2) discourse may be concerned with the future: — 'So will it be in time to come,' or (3) with the present: — 'So has it come to pass at the present day.'</p>

					<p class="f4">lviii. Three branches of wisdom, to wit, knowledge of one's former lives, knowledge of the decease and rebirth of beings, knowledge in the destruction of the 'intoxicants.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>These, friends, are the Triple Doctrines perfectly set forth by the Exalted One who knows, who sees.

					<hr class="demi"/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Literally, the negatives of the three in 1. They are invested, in Pali, with a positive force; they are contraries, logically speaking, not contradictories. B. allows an alternative reading: <i>akusalamūlaṁ</i> means either 'bad root' or 'root of all that is bad.' 'Bad,' for a Buddhist, means 'productive of painful result,' 'demeritorious.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Vitakkā: an unspecialised expression in the Nikāyas; in Abidhamma, inception of cogitative activity. Cf. p. 213, i.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Nekkhamma. B. does not analyse this term. By the context it is the contrary of <i>kāma</i> (sense-desire). 'All good states are <i>nekkhamma-dhātu.</i>' Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Sankappa. 'There is no difference in the meaning (content, attha) of sankappa and vitakka.' Comy. Cf. Compendium, p.238.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Arūpadhātu. Here dhātu is used to mean the place reached in rebirths (āagataṭṭhānasmiṅ bhavena), says B., and describes the three in the terms used in Dhs. (Bud. Psy. Eth.), §§1281-6. It will be seen that the lowest (5) spheres are included in the universe of sense desire (Kāma; below, 3.40, 3.41.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> Nibbāna is here referred to. Comy. Cf. below, 3.18</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> I.e., the twelve classes of bad thoughts (Bud. Psy. Eth., § 365, f.), all other worldly (secular) thoughts, and (3) the nine spiritual thoughts. Comy. In the 'Bahudhātuka Sutta' (M.III,61 f.), dhātu's are enumerated in one category of 18, three of 6, one of 3, and one of 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> Here taken in the sense of 'for life to end' (3.16), the Uccheda or Annihilationist view. See Vibhanga, 365 f., where the 3 threes are defined, and which B. quotes. B. concludes: 'What did he teach in this section (3.16-3.18)? That under the aspect of lusting, all ideas of life are based on [what is termed] taṇhā, and as all taṇhā is permeated (pariyāditvā) by sensuous craving, he shows the other two forms as deduced (niharitvā) from that.' Cf. above, 3.16.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> See Expositor i, 65. B.'s note on the first runs: belief in the actual existence of a kāya consisting in body and mind — i.e., of a soul (attā) in either of them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> 'Āsava, in the sense of surrounding, or of flowing up to ... e.g., from the eye (or sight) a flowing, percolating, rolling on into the object ... Abhidhamma, adding diṭṭhi (erroneous opinion), gives four.' Comy. Cf. Dhs., §§ 1096-1100, and above, p. 175, <i>n.</i>1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> Brahmacariyesanā — i.e., eschatological problems, concerning the soul and its beginning, nature, and ending (antagāhikā diṭṭhi). See Vibh., p.366.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> See Vibh. 367; S. I, 12 (2); III, 48. The first form, says B., besets kings and recluses; the second, the king's officials; the third form is characteristic of servants (?).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> Addhā. The Four Nikāyas use addhānaṅ, e.g., A. V. 32; S. I, 140. B. distinguishes between the religious and philosophical denotation of addhā (Suttanta-, Abhidhamma-pariyāyuā). In the former, 'the present' refers to one span of life; 'the past' is time prior to this span of life; 'the future' is time after decease from this life. In the latter, the present is any threefold instant (nascent, static, cessant); past and future precede and follow that.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> Sakkāyo. 'The five aggregates (body and mind) of grasping.' Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a></sup> 'The discontinuance, extinction (nibbāna) of both.' Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a></sup> The first dukkhatā is painful feeling, the second is neutral feeling, but is our oppressed awareness of the tyranny of birth, old age, and dissolution. The third is pleasant feeling, but with the accompanying sense of liability to be plunged into sorrow. Such is the substance of B.'s comment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a></sup> <i>Niyata:</i> certain, fixed. The first are the crimes enumerated in Points, 80, n. 5; df. p. 177, n.1; the second, the fourfold Path and its fruits. On 'heap' see op. cit. XXI, 7</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a></sup> B. reads tamā for kankhā: 'obfuscations.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a></sup> Tathāgata, here clearly meaning a Buddha, at least according to commentarial tradition, since B. proceeds to show the little difference in the case of 'other Arahants,' who needed to take care. He instances the conduct of Sāriputta in the 'Cātuma-sutta,' M. I, 459, explaining the latter's motive. Cf. Ang. IV, 82, where the 'friends' is omitted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a></sup> Literally, 'somewhats.' The secondary meaning is paraphrased by 'palibodho.' Cf. B. here, and Comy. on Dup. 200 (III, 258).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a></sup> I.e., the ministry due to parents, to children, wife and dependants, and to the religious world. Ang IV, 45; cf. II, 70.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a></sup> Or non-reacting. A psycho-physical category. See Bud. Psy. Eth., §§ 754-6. The third kind is also applicable to very subtle matter. Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a></sup> Sankhāra: — because 'they compound co-existent states and states of future-life-results; they make a heap (rāsiṁ).' Comy. But cf. above, p.204, <i>n.</i>2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a></sup> Aneñjabhisankhāro: — it compounds what is immovable ... has become result, is immaterial ... a synonym for will for rebirth in the Arūpa heavens. Comy. Cf. S. II, 82 f.; Vibh. 135, 340.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a></sup> I.e., the puthujjana, or 'man in the street,' average person.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a></sup> Whom the novices speak of as 'thera.' Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a></sup> Grounds for profit, advantages.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a></sup> To be consulted in detail in the Sāmanta pāsādikā (B.'s Comy. on the Vinaya). Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a></sup> These two curiously named groups are the highest stages of life in the 'sensuous universe.' Cf. below, p.241</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a></sup> Devā Ābhassarā. Cf. Kindred Sayings, p. 144, and Compendium, p. 138.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a></sup> Subhakiṇha devas; ninth in the Rūpa worlds. For tesan taṅ yeva the Comy. reads te santam eva, santam meaning paṇitaṅ.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a></sup> Cf. Bud. Psy., p. 130.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a></sup> Detachment of body (solitude), of mind (purity), and from the conditions of rebirth. Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a></sup> Cf. Bud. Psy. Eth., §§ 296, 364a, 555; Vibh., p. 124; P.P., p.2; Yam. II, 61.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a></sup> Cf. Iti-vuttaka, § 61.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a></sup> Cf. A. I, 235; Buddhism (by Mrs. Rhys Davids), 1912, p. 199 f.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a></sup> Kāyo, usually, in Abidhamma, referring to the psycho-physical mechanism of sense. Culture is literally making to become, developing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a></sup> B. refers these to categories of Path, Fruit, and Nibbaāna, with alternative assignments.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a></sup> Samādhi. Cf. M. III, 162; S. IV, 360; A. IV, 300; Compendium 95.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a></sup> Cf. Bud. Psy. Eth., p. 91 f.; Compendium 216.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a></sup> Moneyyāni: munibhāvakarā dhammā. Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a></sup> Ayo, apāyo, upāyo; derivatives from i, to go. The second more usually covers all evil rebirth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a></sup> Or Āsava's. On the annexation, with the meaning above given, of the adjective te-vijjo, see Psalms of the Sisters, 26, n. 2. B. exegetically paraphrases vijjā as tamaṅ vijjhati, pierces the gloom, i.e., of the unknown.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a></sup> The first is the conscious experience of the 'Eight Attainments' or Jhānas, the second that of the Four Exercises in sublime emotion (cf. I, p. 317 f.), the third is that of the Fruitions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a></sup> See I, p. 277f.</p>
