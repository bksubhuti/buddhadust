					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[221]</span> 11. <i>Fourfold doctrines, friends, have been perfectly set forth by the Exalted One who knows, who sees, the Arahant, Buddha supreme. Here should be a chanting in concord by all, not a wrangling...for...the happiness of devas and of men. Which are these?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Four applications of mindfulness,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> to wit: — Herein, friends, let a brother as to the body ... as <span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span> to feelings ... as to thoughts ... as to ideas continue so to look on these [severally and in order], that he remains ardent, self-possessed and mindful, overcoming both the hankering and the dejection common in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four supreme efforts,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to wit: — Herein, friends, a brother, in order that unrisen wrong and wicked ideas may not arise ... in order that wrong and wicked ideas if arisen, may be put away ... in order that unrisen good ideas may arise ... in order that good ideas, if arisen, may persist, may be clarified, multiplied, expanded, developed, perfected, generates will endeavours, stirs up energy, makes firm his mind, struggles.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four stages to efficiency (iddhi).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> Herein, friends, a brother develops the stage which is characterized by (1) the mental co-efficient of an effort of purposive concentration; (2) by the mental co-efficient of an effort of intellectual concentration; (3) by the mental co-efficient of an effort of energized <span class="f2">[222]</span>concentration; (4) by the mental co-efficient of an effort of investigating concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four Jhānas. Herein, friends, a brother, aloof from sensuous appetites, aloof from evil ideas, enters into and abides in the First Jhāna, wherein there is initiative and sustained thought, which is born of solitude, and is full of zest and ease.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> Secondly, when suppressing initiative and sustained thought, he enters into and abides in the Second Jhāna, which is self-evoked, born of concentration, full of zest and ease, in that, set free from initial and sustained thought, the mind grows calm and sure, dwelling on high. Thirdly, when a brother, no longer fired with zest, abides calmly contemplative, while mindful and self-possessed he feel in his body that ease whereof Ariyans declare: He that is calmly contemplative and aware, he dwelleth at ease, so does he enter into and abide in the Third Jhāna. Fourthly, by putting aside ease and by putting aside malaise, by the passing away of the joy and the sorrow he used to feel, he enters into and abides in the Fourth Jhāna, rapture of utter purity of mindfulness and equanimity, wherein neither ease is felt nor any ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four developments of concentration,<span class="f3"><sup>5</sup></span> to wit, that which when practised and expanded, conduces to (1) pleasure in this life; (2) acquisition of intuition and insight; (3) mindfulness and well-awareness; (4) destruction of 'spiritual intoxicants. Which are these severally? (1) is the Fourfold Jhāna. <span class="f2">[223]</span>(2) is when a brother attends to the sensation of light,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> sustains the perception of daylight, and attends to light <span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span> no less in the night-time, and thus, with open and unmuffled consciousness, creates a radiant luminous mind. (3) is the understanding of each feeling, or perception or thought, as they severally arise, remain present and vanish. (4) is the keeping watch over the five aggregates of grasping, as they rise and cease:--'This is material ... this is the appearance of something material ... this is the vanishing, and so on.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Four 'infinitudes,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> to wit: — Herein, brethren, a brother lets his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of love ... pity ... sympathy ... in joy ... equanimity, and so the second quarter, and so the third, and so the fourth. And thus <span class="f2">[224]</span> the whole wide world, above, below, around and everywhere does he continue to pervade with heart ... far-reaching, grown great and beyond measure, free from anger and ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four Jhānas of Arūpa-consciousness, to wit:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> — Herein, brethren, a brother, by passing beyond the consciousness of matter, by the dying out of the sensation of resistance, by paying no heed to the idea of difference, at the thought: 'space is infinite!' attains to and abides in the conceptual sphere of space as infinite. (2) Having wholly transcended this, at the thought: 'Infinite is consciousness!' he attains to and abides in the conceptual sphere of consciousness as infinite. (3) Having wholly transcended this, at the thought: 'It is nothing!' he attains to and abides in the conceptual sphere of nothingness. (4) Having wholly transcended this, he attains to and abides in the sphere of neither consciousness nor unconsciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four Bases of Conduct:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> — Herein, brethren, a brother judges that a certain thing is to be habitually pursued, another thing is to be endured, another to be avoided, another to be suppressed.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span>  Four Ariyan lineages. Herein, brethren, a brother is content with whatever robes [he may have], commends contentment of this kind, and does not try togain robes in improper unsuitable ways. And he is not dismayed if he gain no robe, but when he has gained one,he is not greedy, nor infatuated nor overwhelmed; he wears it heedful lest he incur evil and understanding its object. Finally, by this contentment as to any garment, he neither is puffed up nor disparages others. Now he that is expert, not slothful, heedful, mindful, <span class="f2">[225]</span> is called, brethren, a brother who is true to the ancient distinguished lineage of the Ariyans.<br/>
					The same is he who is similarly content with his alms, and with his lodging.<br/>
					Lastly, brethren, the brother who, having the love both of eliminating on the one hand, and of developing on the other, loves both to eliminate and to develop, in loving both, neither is puffed up, nor disparages others. He that is herein expert, not slothful, heedful, mindful, is called a brother who is true to the ancient distinguished lineage of the Ariyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four exertions, to wit, self-control, eliminating, developing, safe-guarding. What is the first? Herein, brethren, when a brother sees an object with the eye, and is not entranced by the general appearance or the details of it, <span class="f2">[226]</span> but sets himself to restrain that which might give occasion for bad, wicked states, covetousness, dejection to flow in over him were he to dwell unrestrained as to the faculty of sight, and to keep watch over that faculty, and attains to mastery over it ... and similarly as to the other four senses and mind, such an effort is called exertion in self-control.<span class="f3"><sup>10</sup></span> (2) What is exertion in elimination? Herein, brethren, a brother, when a sensual, malign, or cruel thought has arisen, will not endure it, but puts it away, suppresses, exterminates it and makes it non-existent. Such an <span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span> exertion is called exertion in elimination. (3) What is exertion in developing? Herein, brethren, a brother cultivates each of the seven factors of enlightenment<span class="f3"><sup>11</sup></span> which are based upon detachment, upon passionlessness, upon cessation, and wherein is maturity<span class="f3"><sup>12</sup></span> of self-surrender.<span class="f3"><sup>13</sup></span> This is called exertion in development. (4) What is exertion in safe-guarding? Herein, brethren, a brother keeps pure and genuine<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> an auspicious object of concentrated imagination when it has arise, [such as] one of the contemplations of foul things. This is called exertion in safe-guarding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four knowledges,<span class="f3"><sup>15</sup></span> to wit, knowledge of the Doctrine, knowledge in its corollaries, knowledge of what is in another's consciousness,<span class="f3"><sup>16</sup></span> and popular knowledge.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[227]</span> Other four knowledges, to wit: knowledge regarding suffering, genesis, cessation, path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four factors in 'Stream-attainment,' to wit, intercourse with the good, hearing the good doctrine, systematized<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span> attention, practice in those things that lead up to the doctrine and its corollaries.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four factors of his state who has attained the stream. Herein, brethren, the Ariyan disciple has an <span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span> unshakeable faith (1) in the Buddha:--'So he too, the Exalted One, is Arahant, supremely enlightened, full of wisdom and goodness, Blessed One, world-knower, peerless driver and tamer of men, teacher of devas and men, Buddha, Exalted One!' (2) in the Norm:--Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm, effective in this life and without delay, bidding us come and see, leading us onward, to be known by the wise as a personal experience. (3) in the Order:-- Well practised is the Order of the Exalted One's disciples, in uprightness, method and propriety, namely, the four pairs of persons, the eight classes of individuals. Thi is the Order of the Exalted One's disciples, to whom offerings and ministering should be made, and gifts and reverent greeting as unto the supreme field of merit throughout the world. (4) Endowed is it with virtues lovely to the Ariyans, unbroken and flawless, consistently practised, unblemished, making men free, commended by the wise, unperverted and conducing to rapt concentration.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Four fruits of the life of a recluse, to wit, the fruit of [the fourfold path, i.e. of] Stream-attainment, of the Once-returner, of the Never-returner, of Arahantship.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Four stations of consciousness. Brethren, when consciousness gaining a foothold persists, it is <span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span> either in connection with material qualities, or with [a co-efficient of] feeling, or perception or volitional complexes. In connection with any of these as an instrument, as an object of thought, as a platform, as a set of enjoyment, it attains to growth, increase, abundance.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Four matters to be realized,<span class="f3"><sup>32</sup></span> to wit, former lives, to be realized by clear mentality;<span class="f3"><sup>33</sup></span> decease and rebirth, to be realized by the 'heavenly eye'; the eight deliverances, to be realized by all the mental factors;<span class="f3"><sup>33</sup></span> destruction of intoxicants, to be realized by insight.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a></sup></span></p>
