					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[234]</b></span> <i>There are Sevens in the Doctrine, friends, which have been perfectly set forth by the Exalted One who <span class="f2 g"><b>[235]</b></span> knows, who sees ... Here should there be chanting by all in concord, not wrangling ... for the happiness of devas and men. Which are they?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Seven treasures,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> to wit, the treasure of faith, of morals, of conscientiousness, of discretion, of learning, of self-denial, of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven factors of enlightenment, to wit, the factor of mindfulness, <span class="f2">[252]</span>of study of doctrines, of energy, of zest, of serenity, of concentration, of equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven requisites of concentration,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to wit, right views, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven vicious qualities, to wit, want of faith, unconscientiousness, indiscretion, want of doctrinal knowledge, slackness, muddleheadedness, want of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven virtuous qualities, to wit, the opposites of the foregoing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven qualities of the good, to wit, knowledge of the Dhamma, of the meaning [contained in its doctrines], knowledge of self, knowledge how to be temperate, how to choose and keep time, knowledge of groups of persons, and of individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven bases of Arahantship.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					Herein, friends, a brother is keenly desirous of entering the training,<br/>
					and longs to continue doing so.<br/>
					He feels similarly with regard to insight into the doctrine,<br/>
					to the suppression of hankerings,<br/>
					to [the need of] solitude,<br/>
					to evoking energy,<br/>
					to mindfulness and perspicacity,<br/>
					<span class="f2">[253]</span>to intuition of the truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven perceptions, to wit, that of impermanence, of soullessness, of ugliness, of evil [in the world], of elimination, of passionlessness, of cessation.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[236]</b></span> Seven powers, to wit, the power of faith, energy, conscientiousness, discretion, mindfulness, concentration, insight.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Seven stations of consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup>6</sup></span> There are beings, brethren, who are diverse both in body and in mind, such as mankind, certain devas and some who have gone to an evil doom. This is the first station (or persistence) for [re-born] consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> Other beings are diverse of body, but uniform in mind, such as the devas of the Brahma-world, reborn there from [practice here of] first [Jhāna].<br/>
					Others are uniform in body, diverse in intelligence, such as the Radiant Devas. Others are uniform both in body and in intelligence, such as the All-Lustrous Devas.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> Others there are who, by having passed wholly beyond all consciousness of matter, by the dying out of the consciousness of sense-reaction, by having turned the attention away from any consciousness of the manifold and become conscious only of 'space as infinite' are dwellers in the realm of infinite space. Others there are who, by having passed wholly beyond the realm of infinite space and become conscious only of consciousness as infinite are dwellers in the realm of infinite consciousness. Others there are who, having passed wholly beyond the realm of infinite consciousness, and become conscious only that 'there is nothing whatever,' are dwellers in the realm of nothingness. Such are the remaining stations of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven [types of] persons worthy of offerings, to wit, the freed-both-ways, <span class="f2">[254]</span> the freed by insight, they who have bodily testimony, they who have won <span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span> the view, they who are freed by confidence, the followers of wisdom, and the followers of confidence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Seven kinds of latent bias,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> to wit, the bias of sensual passion, of enmity, of false opinion, of doubt, of conceit, of lust for rebirth, of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven fetters, to wit, compliance, opposition, false opinion, doubt, conceit, lust for rebirth, ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven rules for the pacifying and suppression of disputed questions that have been raised,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> to wit, the proceeding face-to-face must be performed, the proceeding for the consciously innocent must be performed, the proceeding in the case of those who are no longer out of their mind must be performed, the proceeding on confession of guilt must be carried out, the proceeding by a majority of the Chapter, or the proceeding for the obstinate, or the proceeding by covering over as with grass.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>These, friends, are the Sevens in the Doctrine perfectly set forth by the Exalted One who knows, who sees. Hereon there should be a chanting by all in concord, not a wrangling, that thus this holy life may persist and be long maintained. That may be for the welfare and happiness of many folk, for compassion on the world, for the good, the welfare, the happiness of devas and of men.</i></p>
