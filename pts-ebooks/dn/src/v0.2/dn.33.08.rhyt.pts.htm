					<p class="f4">Eight bases of giving gifts:--One gives (1) because [an object of hospitality] has approached; (2) from fear;<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> (3) because 'he gave to me'; (4) because <span class="f2 g"><b>[240]</b></span> 'he will give to me'; (5) because one thinks 'giving is blessed'; (6) because one thinks 'I cook; these do not cook; it is not fit that I who cook should give nothing to those who do not cook'; (7) because one thinks: 'from the giving of this gift by me an excellent report will spread abroad'; (8) because one wishes to adorn and equip one's heart.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">14</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Eight rebirths due to giving gifts. Herein, friends, (1) a certain person gives a gift to a recluse or brahmin in the shape of food, drink, raiment, vehicle, wreaths,perfumes and ointments, bedding, dwelling and lights. That which he gives, he hopes to receive in his turn. He sees a wealthy noble or brahmin or householder surrounded and attended by, and enjoying the five forms of sensuous pleasures. And he thinks: 'Ah! if only I may be reborn at the dissolution of the body after death as one amongst wealthy nobles, or brahmins, or householders!" This thought he holds fixed, firmly established, and expands it. This thought set free in a lower range, and not expanded to anything higher, conduces to rebirth within that range. <span class="f2">[259]</span> And this, I affirm, only in the case of a moral person, not of one who is vicious. The mental aspiration, friends, of a moral person succeeds because of its purity.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					(2) Another person giving similar gifts, and similarly hoping, may have learnt thus: 'Devas in the realm of the four kings of the firmament<span class="f3"><sup>6</sup></span> are long-lived, splendid in appearance and lead a blissful existence.' He aspires to be reborn among them, and holds the thought fixed....This...conduces to rebirth within that [lower] range. And this, I affirm, only in the case of a moral person. ... The mental aspiration, brethren, of a moral person<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> succeeds because of its purity.<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[241]</b></span> (3-7) Or one so giving may have learnt similar lore about other heavens:--the Three-and Thirty gods, the Yāma, the Tusita, the Nimmānarati, the Paranimmita-vasavatti gods, or (8) about the gods of the Brahma world he may have learnt in similar terms. He thinks: 'Ah! would that after death I might be reborn as one among them!' That thought he holds fixed, that thought he firmly establishes, that thought he expands. That thought set free in a lower range,<span class="f3"><sup>8</sup></span> and not expanded to anything higher, conduces to rebirth within that range. And this, <span class="f2">[260]</span> I affirm, only in the case of a moral person, not of one who is vicious, in the case of one who has got rid of the passions, not of one still beset by them. The mental aspiration, friends, of a moral person succeeds because it is void of lustful passion.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Eight assemblies, to wit, those of nobles, brahmins, householders, religious orders, four-king devas, Three-and-Thirty devas, Māra devas and Brahma devas.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Eight matters of worldly concern, to wit, gains and losses, fame and obscurity, blame and praise, pleasures and pains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Eight positions of mastery.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					(1) When anyone pictures to himself some material feature of his person <span class="f2 g"><b>[242]</b></span> and sees [corresponding] features in others,<br/>
					lovely or ugly,<br/>
					as small,<br/>
					transcending this [object] he is aware of doing so,<br/>
					[thinks] 'I know, I see!'<br/>
					(2) Or when he has the same experience,<br/>
					but sees those features not as small,<br/>
					but as infinitely great,<br/>
					and nevertheless transcending this [object],<br/>
					and is aware of doing so [thinks]:<br/>
					'I know, I see!'<br/>
					(3) Or when he sees the features in others<br/>
					lovely or ugly,<br/>
					as small,<br/>
					without first picturing any material feature of his own<br/>
					transcending this [object] he is aware of doing so,<br/>
					[thinks] 'I know, I see!'<br/>
					(4) Or when he sees the features in others<br/>
					but sees those features not as small,<br/>
					but as infinitely great,<br/>
					and nevertheless transcending this [object],<br/>
					and is aware of doing so [thinks]:<br/>
					'I know, I see!'<br/>
					(5) Or when without the personal preliminary,<br/>
					he sees external shapes of indigo,<br/>
					<span class="f2">[261]</span> indigo in colour,<br/>
					indigo in visible expanse,<br/>
					indigo in lustre,<br/>
					as is the ummā flower,<br/>
					or a Benares muslin delicately finished on both sides<br/>
					transcending this [object] he is aware of doing so,<br/>
					[thinks] 'I know, I see!'<br/>
					(6) or shapes of yellow<br/>
					yellow in colour,<br/>
					yellow in visible expanse,<br/>
					yellow in lustre,<br/>
					as is the kaṇikāra flower,<br/>
					or Benares muslin delicately finished on both sides<br/>
					transcending this [object] he is aware of doing so,<br/>
					[thinks] 'I know, I see!'<br/>
					(7) or shapes of red<br/>
					red in colour,<br/>
					red in visible expanse,<br/>
					red in lustre,<br/>
					as is the bandhujīvaka flower,<br/>
					or Benares muslin delicately finished on both sides<br/>
					transcending this [object] he is aware of doing so,<br/>
					[thinks] 'I know, I see!'<br/>
					(8) or shapes of white,<br/>
					white in colour,<br/>
					white in visible expanse,<br/>
					white in lustre<br/>
					as is the morning star,<br/>
					or Benares muslin delicately finished on both sides<br/>
					transcends this [object] and is aware of doing so,<br/>
					[thinks]: 'I know, I see!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Eight deliverances,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> to wit,<br/>
					(1) He, picturing any material feature of himself,<br/>
					sees such material features [as they really are].<br/>
					(2) Not picturing any such,<br/>
					<span class="f2">[262]</span> he sees material features external to his own.<br/>
					(3) He decides that it is beautiful.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/>
					(4) By passing wholly beyond all consciousness of material qualities,<br/>
					by the dying out of the awareness of sensory reaction,<br/>
					by the unheeding of any awareness of difference,<br/>
					he enters into and abides<br/>
					in that rapt ecstasy<br/>
					which is a consciousness of infinite space.<br/>
					(5) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere of consciousness,<br/>
					he enters into and abides<br/>
					in that rapt ecstasy<br/>
					which is a consciousness of infinitude of consciousness itself.<br/>
					(6) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere of consciousness,<br/>
					he enters into and abides<br/>
					in that rapt <span class="f2 g"><b>[243]</b></span> ecstasy<br/>
					which regards consciousness itself as nothing whatever,<br/>
					a sphere of nothingness.<br/>
					(7) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere,<br/>
					he enters into and abides<br/>
					in that rapt consciousness<br/>
					which neither is,<br/>
					nor yet is not<br/>
					to be called conscious.<br/>
					(8) By passing wholly beyond such a sphere,<br/>
					he enters into and abides<br/>
					in a state of unconsciousness,<br/>
					wherein awareness and feeling cease.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Lit. 'wrongnesses' and in (ii.) 'rightnesses' (the 'Ariyan Eightfold Path'), elsewhere called magga, kummagga (wrong path), paṭipadā and paṭipatti. Cf. S., V, 18,23: Vibh. 373, etc., etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Sometimes rendered 'aspiration'; a synonym  of vitakka. Application of the mind to an object or mental 'contriving' must be understood.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> RD has 'unrealizable.' which must be a typo.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Either from fear of blame, or of future retribution. Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Namely, in studying for calm and insight, for giving softens the heart in both donor and recipient. Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> I.e., its being unmixed, single-minded.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> Cf. preceding Suttanta passim.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Omitted in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> All rebirth in other worlds, from the Nibbāna or Arahant point of view, was low in range. But the Brahma world was also lowest in the Rūpa heavens. Only in the upper Rūpa worlds could Parinibbāna be obtained, when not accomplished on earth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Got rid of, remarks B., either by the Paths or by the Attainments (Jhāna). Charitable giving alone cannot secure rebirth in Brahma world. But as an adornment to the mind studying calm and insight, they make thought tender, and then, exercise in the Brahma-vihāara emotions (I, 317, f., § 76) can lead to such a rebirth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> There is no comment on the absence of parisā's in other worlds. Presumably it is because no such assemblies are recorded in the Suttas, nor mention of any hierarchy or government, as e.g., in Dial. I, 282; II, 242 f., 293 (21), etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> See II, 118. The 'positions' refer to induction of the Jhāna consciousness. Cf. Bud. Psy. Eth., §§ 204-246; Expositor, ch. xi.</p>
