					<p class="f4">Nine bases of quarrelling, thus: —<br/>
					quarrelling is stirred up<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> at the thought:<br/>
					'he has done me an injury,'<br/>

					<p class="f4">Nine spheres inhabited by beings. <i>The first four are described in terms verbatim of the first</i> four stations of consciousness [<b>2.</b> 3, x.]<span class="f3"><sup>ed1</sup></span>. (5) There are beings without perception or feeling. These live in <span class="f2 g"><b>[244]</b></span> the sphere of the 'unconscious devas.'<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> (6) There are beings who having passed wholly beyond awareness of material qualities, by the dying out of sensory reaction, by unheeding the awareness of difference, have attained to the sphere of infinite space with a consciousness thereof. (7-9) Similarly other beings have attained to the sphere of infinite consciousness, of nothingness, of neither consciousness nor yet unconsciousness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Nine untimely unseasonable intervals for life in a religious order,<br/>
					<span class="f2">[264]</span> (1) A Tathāgata, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions],<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer.<br/>
					And this person is reborn at that time in purgatory.<br/>
					This is the first untimely,<br/>
					unseasonable period<br/>
					for living in a religious order.<br/>
					(2) A Tathāgata, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer.<br/>
					And this person is reborn at that time in the animal kingdom.<br/>
					This is the second untimely,<br/>
					unseasonable period<br/>
					for living in a religious order.<br/>
					(3) A Tathāgata, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer.<br/>
					And this person is reborn at that time among the Petas.<br/>
					This is the third untimely,<br/>
					unseasonable period<br/>
					for living in a religious order.<br/>
					(4) A Tathāgata, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer.<br/>
					And this person is reborn at that time among the Asuras.<br/>
					This is the fourth untimely,<br/>
					unseasonable period<br/>
					for living in a religious order.<br/>
					(5) A Tathāgata, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer.<br/>
					And this person is reborn at that time among some long-lived deva community.<br/>
					This is the fifth untimely,<br/>
					unseasonable period<br/>
					for living in a religious order.<br/>
					(6) A Tathāgata, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer.<br/>
					And this person is reborn at that time in the border countries among unintelligent barbarians, where there is no opening for members of the Order or lay-brethren.<br/>
					This is the sixth untimely,<br/>
					unseasonable period<br/>
					for living in a religious order.<br/>
					(7) A Tathāgata, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer.<br/>
					And this person is reborn at that time in the middle countries, but he holds wrong opinions and has perverted vision, holding that gifts,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> offerings, oblations are as naught, for there is no fruit nor result of deeds well or ill done; <span class="f2">[265]</span> there are no parents nor birth without them; there are no recluses or brahmins in the world who have attained the highest, leading perfect lives, and who, having known and realized each for himself the truth as to this and the next world, do reveal it.<br/>
					This is the seventh untimely,<br/>
					unseasonable period<br/>
					for living in a religious order.<br/>
					(8) A Tathāgata, friends, is born into the world, Arahant Buddha Supreme. The Norm is taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, declared by the Well-Farer.<br/>
					And though reborn at the time in the Middle countries, he is stupid, dull, or deaf and dumb, unable to know whether a matter has been well said or ill said.<br/>
					This is the eighth untimely,<br/>
					unseasonable period<br/>
					for living in a religious order.<br/>
					(9) Or finally, friends, a Tathāagata has not arisen in the world as Arahant Buddha Supreme, the <span class="f2 g"><b>[245]</b></span> Norm is not taught, quenching [the passions], extinguishing [the passions], leading to enlightenment, as revealed by the Well-Farer; and this person is [in that interval] reborn in the Middle country, is intelligent, bright of wit, nor deaf-mute, able to know whether a matter has been well said or ill said.<br/>
					This is the ninth untimely,<br/>
					unseasonable period<br/>
					for living in a religious order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nine successional states, to wit, the Four Jhānas [of Rūpa-world consciousness], the Four Jhānas of Arūpa-world consciousness <span class="f2">[266]</span> and complete trance.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Nine successional cessations, thus:--Taking each of the foregoing nine in order, by the attainment of (1) First Jhāna, sensuous perceptions cease, (2) Second Jhāna, applied and sustained thought ceases, (3) Third Jhāna zest ceases, (4) Fourth Jhāna, respiration ceases, (5) by the perception of infinite space, perception of material things ceases, (6) by the perception of infinite consciousness, perception of infinite space ceases, (7) by the perception of nothingness, perception of infinite consciousness ceases, (8) by the perception that is neither conscious nor yet unconscious, perception of nothingness ceases, (9) by the cessation of perception and feeling, perception that is neither conscious nor yet unconscious ceases.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> I have not broken the code in which this reference was written, these four do exist at Vol.2:#15:33: 'There are beings differing in body and differing in intelligence, for instance, human beings and certain of the gods and some of those in purgatory.

					'There are beings differing in body but of uniform intelligence, for instance, the gods of the Brahma-heaven who are there reborn by means of the First [Jhāna]. This is the second resting-place for Cognition.<br/>
					'There are beings uniform in body and differing in intelligence, for instance, the Luminous Gods. This is the third resting place for Cognition.<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Assuming as the Buddhist does, that in Jhāna ecstasy, terrestrial consciousness was exchanged for other-world consciousness, he was logically driven to assume also a source for the abnormal state of mind supervening in complete trance.</p>
