					<p class="f4"><i>These Tens in the Doctrine, friends, have been perfectly set forth by the Exalted One, who knows, who sees. Here should there be chanting by all in concord, not wrangling, in order that the holy life may live and be long established. Thus will it be for the welfare, for the happiness of multitudes, a kindness to the world, for the good, the welfare, the happiness of devas and men.</i></p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p class="f4">Now when the Exalted One had arisen he addressed the venerable Sāriputta saying: 'Excellent, Sāriputta, excellent! Excellently, Sāriputta, have you uttered the scheme of chanting together<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> for the brethren.'<br/>
					These things were spoken by the venerable Sāriputta. The Master signified his assent. The brethren were pleased and delighted with the venerable Sāriputta's discourse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Lit. protector-making. For (1) cf. Dial.I, 317. 'Self-control prescribed,'etc., is pātimokkha-saṁvara.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> See Vin. Texts III, 50, on these qualifications for a bhikkhu juryman, and the footnote.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Piya-samudāhāro, concerning which term Childers was doubtful, is thus expanded by B.: 'he listens intently (sakkaccaṁ) when another discourses and longs to teach others.' Cf. Mil. II, 237.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Abhidhamme Abhivinaye. B., by alternative exegeses, shows these terms are used vaguely, The former may mean the third Piṭake(?), or the doctrine of the Paths and Fruits. The latter may mean the Khandhaka-Parivāra, or the <i>end</i> of the vinaya--self-mastery. Cf. Sumagala Vilāsinī I, 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Kasiṇa,</i> 'in the sense of <i>entire</i> (sakala).' Comy. Cf. Bud. Ps. Eth., pp. 43 f., <i>n.</i> 4; 57 f., <i>n.</i> 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> On the varying number of these 'objects' in Buddhist literature see B.P.E., p.57, n.2. Buddhaghosa also comments thereon in The Expositor, p. 249 f., but not here, nor in the Visuddhimagga, though he refers to fuller treatment there. There he drops the 'consciousness' object altogether, substituting āloka, or brightness. He identifies the former with the second of the Eight Deliverances (or second Arūpa-jhāna). See above (mo: follow links).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Kindred Sayings I, 124</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> Cf. above, 216, viii</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> A curious use of <i>sacca</i> (fact or truth). 'This view, that view is true! Thus <i>pātiyekkam gahitāni</i> ..." Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> Cf. above, p. 209, xxii</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>11 [<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> The distinctive replies given in the case of citta and paññā should be noted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> This No. v., which is a Sutta in the Aṅguttara (v., 29), is presumably the Ariya-vasāni, one of the five Dhamma-teachings recommended for study in Asoka's Bhabra edict. Cf. Rh. Davids, Buddhist India, 169.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> That is, these factors in their case are 'connected with fruition.' The 'views' and 'insight' are understanding (or intellect, paññā) exercised on two sorts of occasion (ṭhāna). To avoid multiplying footnotes, references have not been given to all the parallels in the other Nikāyas, of the foregoing summarized doctrines. References, especially to one Nikāya, the Aṅguttara, will be found in Dr. J.E. Carpenters edition of the text.</p>
