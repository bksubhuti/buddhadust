					<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_69">Introduction</h2>

					<p>On this Suttanta we have already commented incidentally in the preceding and the Mahā-Samaya Suttantas (II, 283). Here we wish very briefly to consider the position of these <i>rakkhan's, parittās</i> or prayers for safety in the Buddhist cult. <i>Parittā (pari-trā)</i> means protection, from a root <i>trā,</i> to rescue. It is a different word from the <i>parittaṁ</i> (<i>parītra,</i> limited, little) on which we have commented elsewhere.<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> And it is more often used than its synonym <i>rakkhaṁ,</i> the term used here. A list of <i>parittās</i> is given in the <i>Questions of King Milinda</i> (trs. I, 231), and the sanction of their use is there made one of the horns of a dilemma, thus: — 'The <i>Parittās</i> were promulgated by the Blessed One, that is to say, the <i>Ratana Sutta,</i> the <i>Khandha, Peacock, Banner-crest, Āṭānāṭiya</i> and <i>Angulimāla Parittās.</i> Now if a man may not escape death, the Paritta is useless; if the <i>Parittā</i> saves him, it is not true that he cannot escape death.' All of these <i>Parittās</i> are translated into English. The <i>Ratana</i> is in the <i>Khuddakapatha,</i> translated by Childers,<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> and the Sutta-Nipāta;<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> the Peacock is the <i>Jātaka</i> verses so called;<span class="f3"><sup>4</sup></span> the Banner-crest is in the Sakka-Saṁyutta;<span class="f3"><sup>5</sup></span> and the Angulimāla may be read in the <i>Theragātha</i> and the <i>Majjhima-Nikāya.</i><span class="f3"><sup>6</sup></span> The Khandha <i>parittā</i> is in the <i>Aṅguttara-Nikaya</i> (II., 72) and in the Cullavagga of the Vinaya.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> In the last-named works it is said to be 'allowed' by the Buddha 'as a watch, a guard, a protection for one's self for the use of the Order.' The occasion for this general injunction was the death of a member through snake-bite. The formula consists of a profession of amity towards the four tribes of snakes, an entreaty against injury from beasts, a prayer for the welfare of all beings. The profession of amity, according to Buddhist doctrine, was no mere matter of pretty speech.</p>

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span> It was to accompany and express a psychic suffusion of the hostile man or beast or spirit with benign, fraternal emotion — with <i>mettā.</i> For strong was the conviction, from Sutta and Vinaya to Buddhaghosa's Visuddhi-Magga,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> that 'thoughts are things,' that psychical action, emotional or intellectual, is capable of working like a force among forces. Europe may yet come round further to this Indian attitude.</p>

					<p>The belief in the effective power to heal, or protect, of the <i>saccakiriyā,</i> or asseveration of something quite true, is but another aspect of the work ascribed to the <i>parittā."</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p>It may well be that Buddhism was compelled to adopt and then adapt, in the <i>parittā,</i> the <i>rakshamantras</i> dear to its converts. There was wisdom shown by the teachers of the new successful Dhamma in making friends out of certain traditions and prejudices very hard to overcome. In moments of vital peril any conceivable means are clutched at that may avail to save. And it is chiefly as a cry for help in sickness that the <i>parittā</i>-rite or <i>pirit</i> survives yet in Ceylon. The simple ritual is described in Spence Hardy's <i>Eastern Monarchism,</i> p. 240, and in Gogerly's <i>Ceylon Buddhism,</i> edited by A. S. Bishop, p. 327 ff.</p>

					<p>But on the other hand there is an aspect under which these guarding runes are not alien to Buddhist doctrine, but are as much in harmony with it as is prayer with a theistic religion. This is not altogether because the agencies whose power to harm is deprecated are not, as in other cults, cursed and anathematized, but are blessed with good wishes, and suffused with an outgoing love. Though, for that matter, we cannot but linger for a moment to render homage to this wonderful vista of faith, wherein even the most malignant spirits and beasts were looked upon, not as hopelessly and eternally damned, but as erring unfortunates upon their agelong upward way, and capable of being doctored and softened by the lovely power of love. What we mean here is that the Buddhist's idea of the moral order reigning in the universe — an order or law which he called Dhamma — justifies him in the practice of the <i>parittā.</i> The kernel of Buddhist doctrine is insight into the moral cosmic order — into the eternal truth of Ill and of its arising and passing, and of the Path whereby it may be overpassed. But this order is not a finished, rigid, alien measure which may be <span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span> applied from without to life and conduct. It is not like an iron gallon jar which may be filled and emptied innumerable times with changing contents. It is more like an infinite web that living creatures themselves are ever weaving. The results of our actions are the web. The pattern that comes out as the web progresses is by us interpreted as moral law. It is a growing induction based on faith, namely, that good brings happiness, evil, unhappiness. And the actions with such pregnant results are acts not only of deed and speech, but also of feeling, thinking, and will. Each thread of the web is the result of some person's karma. Whether that karma be good or bad, the eternal shuttle weaves in the result. And at any given moment it requires, in making up the pattern, which is the fulfilling of the moral law, an act 'of mind, word, or deed from some being or beings. The Hebrew prophet in a fine inspiration conceived the Lord as 'waiting to be gracious.' So the Buddhist, his world teeming with the life and power of beings seen and unseen, all making their own karma, conceives the moral order as, so to speak, waiting for the action of this or that human or non-human being, contributing to the progress of its sempiternal fulfilment. Nāgasena, in the <i>Milinda</i> question, likens this, that we have called a 'waiting' for the human intercession in the <i>Parittā,</i> to the sick man's turning to the physician's remedies. Either means may avail if the patient's karma for this life be not exhausted. The fervent utterances of the <i>Parittā,</i> as synergy of thought sent forth by the utterers, are judged to be a possibly effective medicine no less than the muscular and material appliances of medical art. They are intended to range benign agencies on the side of the patient, and to keep far off those that may harm. Deities as conceived in other creeds were no longer invoked. Short of this, the parittas have yet much of the force of prayer. Balaam's aspiration: 'Let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his!' would be accounted as a prayer by both theist and Buddhist. Even Aaron's benediction of Israel: 'May the Lord bless thee and keep thee,' etc., is a votive uttering — a <i>voeu</i> — an invocation on the lines of the <i>parittās</i>. In these the power and goodness of the wonderful Teacher and Saviour, the truth of the Dhamma, the help of all holy ones — these are made present to the mind and give strength. The heart of unbounded love converts foes to friends, or else to powerlessness, and so drives out fear. So that whether it is to be a prolonged span of safety here, or whether life elsewhere is once more imminent, great allies have been called to aid and are standing by, and all is well.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha on Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Four Kings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
					having set a guard,<br/>
					a screen,<br/>
					a patrol<br/>
					over the four quarters<br/>
					with a great army of Yakkhas,<br/>
					of Gandhabbas,<br/>
					of Kumbhaṇḍas,<br/>
					went to Vulture's Peak when night was far spent,<br/>
					lighting up the whole mountain<br/>
					with their effulgent beauty.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And there they saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

						

					<p class="f4">And of the [attendant] fairies<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>
					some saluted only and sat down at one side,<br/>
					some exchanged greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy,<br/>
					and took their seats on one side;<br/>
					some saluted him with clasped hands,<br/>
					then sat down on one side;<br/>
					some called out their name and family,<br/>
					then sat down on one side;<br/>
					some sat down in silence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

						

					<p class="f4">2. Then King Vessavana<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span><br/>
					so seated<br/>
					spake thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord! there are eminent fairies<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/>
					who do not believe in the Exalted One,<br/>
					and there are eminent fairies who do.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also fairies of middle<br/>
					and of inferior rank<br/>
					who do not believe in him,<br/>
					and there are <span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span> fairies of middle and of inferior rank who do.</p>

					<p class="f4">But for the most part, lord,<br/>
					fairies do not believe in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One teaches a code<br/>
					of abstaining from the taking of life,<br/>
					from theft,<br/>
					inchastity,<br/>
					lying<br/>
					and intemperance.</p>

					<p class="f4">But for the most part, lord,<br/>
					fairies do not abstain<br/>
					from any one of these things.</p>

					<p class="f4">To them such a code<br/>
					is distasteful and disagreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, lord, there are disciples of the Exalted One<br/>
					who haunt the lonely and remote recesses of the forest,<br/>
					where noise,<br/>
					where sound<br/>
					there hardly is,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/>
					where breezes from the pastures blow,<br/>
					hidden from men,<br/>
					suitable for meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">There do eminent fairies dwell,<br/>
					who have no faith in the word of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">That they may find faith,<br/>
					may the Exalted One learn<span class="f3"><sup>17</sup></span> the Āṭānāṭa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span> ward-rune<br/>

					and laymen and laywomen<br/>
					may dwell at ease<br/>
					guarded,<br/>
					protected<br/>
					and unscathed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One by his silence gave consent.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then King Vessavana,<br/>
					noting the Exalted One's consent,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then the Four King's arose from their seat,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Last night<br/>
					while staying near Vulture's Peak<br/>
					the Four Kings<br/>
					having set a guard,<br/>
					a screen,<br/>
					a patrol<br/>
					over the four quarters<br/>
					with a great army of Yakkhas,<br/>

					of Kumbhaṇḍas,<br/>
					went to Vulture's Peak when night was far spent,<br/>
					lighting up the whole mountain<br/>
					with their effulgent beauty.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there they saluted the me<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of the [attendant] fairies<br/>
					some saluted only and sat down at one side,<br/>
					some exchanged greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy,<br/>
					and took their seats on one side;<br/>
					some saluted me with clasped hands,<br/>
					then sat down on one side;<br/>
					some called out their name and family,<br/>
					then sat down on one side;<br/>
					some sat down in silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Vessavana so seated spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord! there are eminent fairies<br/>
					who do not believe in the Exalted One,<br/>
					and there are eminent fairies who do.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also fairies of middle<br/>
					and of inferior rank<br/>
					who do not believe in him,<br/>
					and there are fairies of middle and of inferior rank who do.</p>

					<p class="f4">But for the most part, lord,<br/>
					fairies do not believe in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One teaches a code<br/>
					of abstaining from the taking of life,<br/>
					from theft,<br/>
					inchastity,<br/>
					lying<br/>
					and intemperance.</p>

					<p class="f4">But for the most part, lord,<br/>
					fairies do not abstain<br/>
					from any one of these things.</p>

					<p class="f4">To them such a code<br/>
					is distasteful and disagreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, lord, there are disciples of the Exalted One<br/>
					who haunt the lonely and remote recesses of the forest,<br/>
					where noise,<br/>
					where sound<br/>
					there hardly is,<br/>
					where breezes from the pastures blow,<br/>
					hidden from men,<br/>
					suitable for meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">There do eminent fairies dwell,<br/>
					who have no faith in the word of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">That they may find faith,<br/>
					may the Exalted One learn the Āṭānāṭa ward-rune<br/>

					and laymen and laywomen<br/>
					may dwell at ease<br/>
					guarded,<br/>
					protected<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then I, by silence gave consent.</p>
