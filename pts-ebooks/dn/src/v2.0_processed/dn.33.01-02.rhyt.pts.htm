					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once making a tour in the country of the Mallas,<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> accompanied by a great company of the brethren, numbering about five hundred.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he arrived at Pāvā the Malla capital.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he resided in the mango-grove of Cunda the smith.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a new mote-hall of the Pāvā Mallas named Ubbhaṭaka<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> had not long been built, and had not been occupied by recluse or brahmin or any human being whatever.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Pāvā Mallas heard that the Exalted One on his tour had arrived with his following at Pāvā and was staying in Cunda's mango-grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they went to visit him, and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated they said to him: --</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, a new mote-hall named Ubbhaṭaka has lately been built by us Mallas of Pāvā, and no recluse or brahmin or any human being whatever has yet occupied it.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[208]</span>Let, lord, the Exalted One be the first to make use of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is has first been used by the Exalted One will be for the lasting good and happiness of the Pāvā Mallas."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One by his silence assented.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. When they marked his assent, they rose and saluted him, passing round by his right, and went to the mote-hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">They spread the whole hall with carpets, arranged seats, put a bowl of water ready, hung up an oil lamp, and returned to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Saluting <span class="f2 g"><b>[202]</b></span> him and standing at one side they said:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"The whole mote-hall, lord, is spread with carpets, seats are arranged, a bowl of water has been placed ready, a lamp is hung up.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now, lord, whenever the Exalted One deems the time is fit. ... "</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Then the Exalted One dressed himself and taking bowl and robe he went with the company of brethren to the mote-hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arriving he bathed his feet, and entered the hall, and took his seat facing the east, leaning against the central pillar.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brethren also bathed their feet and entered the hall ranging themselves against the western wall and facing the east, <span class="f2">[209]</span> behind the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Pāvā Mallas also bathed their feet and entered the hall, ranging themselves against the eastern wall and facing the west with the Exalted One before them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One far into the night discoursed on the doctrine to the Pāvā Mallas, instructing, enlightening, inciting and inspiring them.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And then he dismissed them saying:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lovely, Vāseṭṭhas<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> is the night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye deem it time?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"We do, lord," responded the Pāvā Mallas.</p>

					<p class="f4">And rising they saluted the Exalted One by the right and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And presently the Exalted One, surveying the company of brethren wrapped in silence wherever they sat,<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> called to the venerable Sāriputta:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is an absence, Sāriputta, of sloth and torpor in the company of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let a religious discourse occur to thee, My back is aching, I will stretch it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord," replied Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, letting his robe be folded in four, took up the lion-posture on his right side, placing his feet <span class="f2 g"><b>[203]</b></span> one in the curve of the other, mindful and deliberate,<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> having mentally noted a time for arousing himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha, Nātha's son, <span class="f2">[210]</span> had just died at Pāva.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">After his death the Nigaṇṭhas became divided, falling into opposite parties and into strife, disputes broke out and they went on wounding each other with wordy weapons: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thou dost not confess this Norm and Discipline!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do confess it!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wilt <i>thou</i> confess it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thou are in the wrong!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am practising it rightly!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am speaking to the point;<br/>
					thou art off the point!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thou sayest last what should be said first,<br/>
					and first what should come last!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"What thou hast so long excogitated is quite upset!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thy challenge is taken up;<br/>
					thou'rt proved to be wrong!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Begone to get rid of thy opinion, or disentangle thyself if thou canst!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly the Nigaṇṭhas, followers of Nāthaputta, were out methinks to kill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even the lay disciples of the white robe, who followed Nāthaputta, showed themselves shocked,<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> repelled and indignant at the Nigaṇṭhas, so badly was their doctrine and discipline set forth and imparted, so ineffectual was it for guidance, so little conducive to peace, imparted as it had been by one who was not supremely enlightened, and now wrecked as it was of his support and without a protector.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Then the venerable Sāriputta addressed the brethren:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Nigaṇṭha, Nāthaputta, friends, has just died at Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since his death the Nigaṇṭhas have become divided and have fallen into opposite parties and into strife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disputes have broken out and they go on wounding each other with wordy weapons: —</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thou dost not confess this Norm and Discipline!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do confess it!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wilt <i>thou</i> confess it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am practising it rightly!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am speaking to the point;<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Thou sayest last what should be said first,<br/>
					and first what should come last!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What thou hast so long excogitated is quite upset!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thy challenge is taken up;<br/>
					thou'rt proved to be wrong!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Begone to get rid of thy opinion, or disentangle thyself if thou canst!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly the Nigaṇṭhas, followers of Nāthaputta, were out methinks to kill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even the lay disciples of the white robe, who followed Nāthaputta, showed themselves shocked, repelled and indignant at the Nigaṇṭhas, so badly was their doctrine and discipline set forth <span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span> and imparted, so ineffectual was it for guidance, so little conducive to peace, imparted as it had been by one who was not supremely enlightened, and now wrecked as it was of his support and without a protector.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[211]</span> But to us, friends, the Norm has been well set forth and imparted by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is effectual for guidance, conducive to self-mastery, and is imparted by one perfectly enlightened.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Apparently a leading family name among the Mallas both of Pāvā and the neighbouring village, Kusinārā. See II, 181.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Recorded in the same terms of Gotama, <i>e.g.</i> II, 149, <i>S.</i> I, 107; but <i>cf.</i> Devadatta in <i>Vinaya Texts</i> III, 258.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> This episode forms the occasion for Suttanta XXIX, above, p.111, and for the <i>Samāgama Sutta, M.</i> II, 243 f. (MN#104, same as DN#29)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Only the Burmese Mandalay MS, and Rangoon edition and the Siamese edition here read also <i>virattaṛūpā,</i> 'repelled,' as on p.111.</p>

'Cause'; <i>āhāra,</i> usually meaning 'food,' is literally a thing 'adduced,''brought up.' Four kinds of <i>āhāra</i> are specified. e.g., <i>S.</i> II, ii f.; below, 219 — food, contact, purpose, consciousness (in connection with rebirth), all considered as so many causes, conditions, antecedents of 'result' or fruit. Hence <i>āhāra</i> in general can always be rendered by <i>paccaya.</i> So B. 'Condition' = <i>saṅkhāra:</i> the <i>karana</i> or doing, action, that leads to the result. <i>Comy.</i></p>
