					<p class="f4"> Five impossibles, to wit,<br/>

					<p class="f4"> Five points, friends, should be present inwardly to a brother who is desirous of chiding another.<br/>
					'I will speak at a timely moment, not at an untimely moment.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					I will utter what is true, not what is fictitious,<br/>
					I will speak mildly, not roughly.<br/>
					I will speak from a desire <span class="f2">[237]</span> for his good, not for his hurt.<br/>
					I will speak with love in my heart, not enmity.'</p>

					<p class="f4"> Five factors in spiritual wrestling.<br/>
					Herein, <span class="f2 g"><b>[227]</b></span> friends, a brother has confidence, believing in the Tathāgata's enlightenment: —<br/>
					'Thus is the Exalted One: he is Arahant fully awakened, wisdom he has, and righteousness; he is the Well-Farer; he has knowledge of the worlds; he is the supreme driver of men willing to be tamed; the teacher of devas and men; the Awakened and Exalted One' —<br/>
					he is in good health, exempt from suffering, endowed with a smoothly assimilating digestion, neither overheated nor too chilly, but medium, suited for exertion.<br/>
					He is not deceitful nor crafty, honestly making known himself for what he is to the Teacher, or to wise persons among his fellow-disciples.<br/>
					He maintains a flow of energy in eliminating wrong states of mind and evoking good states, vigorous, strongly reaching out, not shirking toil with respect to good states of mind.<br/>
					He has insight, being endowed with understanding which goes to the rise and cessation of all things. Ariyan, penetrating, going to the perfect destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Five Pure Abodes, to wit, the heavens called<br/>
					<i>Avihā,</i><br/>
					<i>Atappā,</i><br/>
					<i>Sudassā,</i><br/>
					<i>Sudassī,</i><br/>
					<i>Akaniṭṭha.</i><span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"> Five classes of persons become Never-returners: —<br/>
					one who passes away before middle age in that world in which he has been reborn,<br/>
					one who so passes after middle age,<br/>
					one who so passes without much toil, with ease,<br/>
					one who so passes with toil and difficulty,<br/>
					one who striving 'upstream' is reborn in the <i>Akaniṭṭha</i> world.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"> Five spiritual barrennesses.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> <span class="f2">[238]</span>Herein, friends, a brother doubts, is perplexed about the Master, comes to no definite choice, is not satisfied. He being thus, his mind does not incline (lit. bend) towards ardour, devotion, perseverance, exertion: — this is the first barrenness.<br/>
					When he doubts, is perplexed about the Doctrine, comes to no definite choice, is not satisfied. He being thus, his mind does not incline (lit. bend) towards ardour, devotion, perseverance, exertion: — this is <span class="f2 g"><b>[228]</b></span> the second barrennesses.<br/>
					When he doubts, is perplexed about the Order, comes to no definite choice, is not satisfied. He being thus, his mind does not incline (lit. bend) towards ardour, devotion, perseverance, exertion: — this is the third barrennesses.<br/>
					When he doubts, is perplexed about the Training, comes to no definite choice, is not satisfied. He being thus, his mind does not incline (lit. bend) towards ardour, devotion, perseverance, exertion: — this is the fourth barrennesses.<br/>
					When he is offended with his fellow-disciples, vexed, agitated, sterile towards them, he being thus, his mind does not incline towards ardour, devotion, perseverance, exertion: — this is the fifth barrenness.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"> Five bondages of the mind.<br/>
					Herein, brethren, when a brother has not got rid of the passion for sense-desires, of desire, fondness, thirst, fever, craving for them, he being thus, his mind does not incline towards ardour, devotion, perseverance, exertion.<br/>
					In the same way, when a brother has not got rid of the passion, desire, fondness, thirst, fever, craving for his own person,<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> he being thus, his mind does not incline towards ardour, devotion, perseverance, exertion.<br/>
					In the same way, when a brother has not got rid of the passion, desire, fondness, thirst, fever, craving for external objects, he being thus, his mind does not incline towards ardour, devotion, perseverance, exertion.<br/>
					Fourthly, if a brother have eaten as much as his stomach can hold,<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> and then abides given over to the ease of repose, of turning from this side to that,<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> of sloth, he being thus, his mind does not incline towards ardour, devotion, perseverance, exertion.<br/>
					Fifthly, <span class="f2">[239]</span> if a brother have adopted the religious life with the aspiration of belonging to some one or other of the deva-groups, thinking: — 'By these rules or by these rites or by these austerities or by this religious life I shall become a greater, or a lesser deva;<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> he being thus, his mind does not incline towards ardour, devotion, perseverance, exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Five faculties,<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> to wit,<br/>
					the faculty of the eye;<br/>
					the faculty of the ear;<br/>
					the faculty of the nose;<br/>
					the faculty of the tongue;<br/>
					the faculty of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Other five faculties, to wit,<br/>
					that of pleasure,<br/>
					of pain,<br/>
					joy,<br/>
					grief,<br/>
					indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Other five faculties, to wit,<br/>
					that of faith,<br/>
					energy,<br/>
					mindfulness,<br/>
					concentration,<br/>
					insight.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Five elements tending to deliverance.<br/>
					Herein, <span class="f2 g"><b>[229]</b></span> friends, when a brother is contemplating sensuous desires, his heart does not leap forward to them, nor rest complacent in them, does not choose them.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> But when he is contemplating renunciation of them, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it. <span class="f2">[240]</span> This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from sense desires. And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of sense-desires, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling. This is pronounced to be the first deliverance.<br/>
					When a brother is contemplating ill will, his heart does not leap forward to that, nor rest complacent in that, does not choose that. But when he is contemplating renunciation of that, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it. This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from ill will. And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of ill will, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling. This is pronounced to be the second deliverance.<br/>
					When a brother is contemplating cruelty, his heart does not leap forward to that, nor rest complacent in that, does not choose that. But when he is contemplating renunciation of that, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it. This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from cruelty. And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of cruelty, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling. This is pronounced to be the third deliverance.<br/>
					When a brother is contemplating external objects, his heart does not leap forward to that, nor rest complacent in that, does not choose that. But when he is contemplating renunciation of that, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it. This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from external objects. And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of external objects, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling. This is pronounced to be the fourth deliverance.<br/>
					When a brother is contemplating individuality, his heart does not leap forward to that, nor rest complacent in that, does not choose that. But when he is contemplating renunciation of that, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it. This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from individuality. And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of individuality, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling. This is pronounced to be the fifth deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[241]</span>  Five occasions of emancipation.<br/>
					Herein, friends, when the Master, or a reverend fellow-disciple teaches the Norm to a brother, according as the teaching is given, the listener comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm.<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> This is the first occasion.<br/>
					In the next place, a brother, while himself is teaching others the Norm in detail, as he has learnt and got it by memory, comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. This is the second occasion.<br/>
					In the third place, a brother, when he is reciting the doctrines of the Norm in detail as he has learnt and got them by memory, comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. <span class="f2">[242]</span> This is the third occasion.<br/>
					In the fourth place, a brother, when he applies his thought to the Norm as he has <span class="f2 g"><b>[230]</b></span> learnt and got it by memory, and sustains protracted meditation on it and contemplates it in mind, comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. This is the fourth occasion.<br/>
					Finally, a brother, when he has well grasped some given clue to concentration,<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span> has well applied his understanding, has well thought it out, has well penetrated it by intuition,<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span>  comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. <span class="f2">[243]</span> This is the fifth occasion.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Five thoughts by which emancipation<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span> reaches maturity, to wit,<br/>
					the notion of impermanence,<br/>
					the notion of suffering in impermanence,<br/>
					the notion of no-soul in suffering,<br/>
					the notion of elimination,<br/>
					the notion of passionlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>These fivefold doctrines, friends, have been perfectly set forth by the Exalted One who knows, who sees.</i></p>
