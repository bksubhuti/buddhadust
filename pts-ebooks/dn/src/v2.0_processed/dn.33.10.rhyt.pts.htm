					<span class="f2 g"><b>[248]</b></span> <span class="f2">[270]</span> (4) What are the four bases of observance? Herein a brother judges that something is to be (i) habitually pursued, (ii) endured, (iii) avoided, (iv) suppressed.<br/>
					(5) How does he become 'one who has put away sectarian opinions?<span class="f1"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> All those many opinions of the mass of recluses and brahmins which are held by individuals as dogmas: — all these he has dismissed, put away, given up, ejected, let go, eliminated, abandoned.<br/>

					(7) How is he candid in his thoughts? He has eliminated occupying his mind with sensual or malicious or cruel ideas.<br/>
					(8) How does he tranquillize the activity of the body?

					<p class="f4">These things were spoken by the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Master signified his assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brethren were pleased and delighted with the venerable Sāriputta's discourse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Lit. protector-making. For (1) <i>cf.</i> Dial. I, 317. 'Self-control prescribed,' etc., is <i>pātimokkha-saṃvara.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> See <i>Vin. Texts</i> III, 50, on these qualifications for a <i>bhikkhu</i> juryman, and the footnote.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Piya-samudāhāro,</i> concerning which term Childers was doubtful, is thus expanded by B.: 'he listens intently <i>(sakkaccaṃ)</i> when another discourses and longs to teach others.' <i>Cf.</i><i> Mil.</i> II, 237.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Abhidhamme Abhivinaye.</i> B., by alternative exegeses, shows these terms are used vaguely, The former may mean the third <i>Piṭake</i>(?), or the doctrine of the Paths and Fruits. The latter may mean the <i>Khandhaka-Parivāra,</i> or the <i>end</i> of the <i>vinaya</i> — self-mastery. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Sumagala Vilāsinī</i> I, 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Kasiṇa,</i> 'in the sense of <i>entire</i> <i>(sakala).</i>' <i>Comy. Cf.</i> <i>Bud. Ps. Eth.,</i> pp. 43 f., <i>n.</i> 4; 57 f., <i>n.</i> 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> On the varying number of these 'objects' in Buddhist literature see <i>B.P.E.,</i> p.57, n.2. Buddhaghosa also comments thereon in <i>The Expositor,</i> p. 249 f., but not here, nor in the <i>Visuddhimagga,</i> though he refers to fuller treatment there. There he drops the 'consciousness' object altogether, substituting <i>āloka,</i> or brightness. He identifies the former with the second of the Eight Deliverances (or second Arūpa-jhāna). See above. (Ed.: follow links)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>Kindred Sayings</i> I, 124</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> above, 216, viii</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> A curious use of <i>sacca</i> (fact or truth). 'This view, that view is true! Thus <i>pātiyekkam gahitāni</i> ..." <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> above, p. 209, xxii</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>] [<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> The distinctive replies given in the case of <i>citta</i> and <i>paññā</i> should be noted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> This No. v., which is a Sutta in the <i>Aṇguttara</i> (v., 29), is presumably the <i>Ariya-vasāni,</i> one of the five Dhamma-teachings recommended for study in Asoka's Bhabra edict. <i>Cf.</i> Rh. Davids, <i>Buddhist India,</i> 169.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> That is, these factors in their case are 'connected with fruition.' The 'views' and 'insight' are understanding (or intellect, <i>paññā</i>) exercised on two sorts of occasion <i>(ṭhāna).</i> To avoid multiplying footnotes, references have not been given to all the parallels in the other <i>Nikāyas,</i> of the foregoing summarized doctrines. References, especially to one <i>Nikāya,</i> the <i>Aṇguttara,</i> will be found in Dr. J.E. Carpenter's edition of the text.</p>
