					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence," these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, these four kinds of persons<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> are found existing in the world.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Your reverences, there is here some person with a blemish<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> who thinks:</p>

						

					<p class="f4">'I have a subjective blemish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">but who does not comprehend it as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there is the person with a blemish who, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have a subjective blemish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">comprehends it as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is here the person without a blemish who thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have no subjective blemish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">but who does not comprehend it as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there is the person without a blemish who, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have no subjective blemish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">comprehends it as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where, your reverences,<br/>
					there is this person with a subjective blemish who thinks,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have a subjective blemish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">but does not comprehend it as it really is,<br/>
					this one, of these two persons with a blemish,<br/>
					is shown to be the inferior man.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Where, your reverences,<br/>
					there is a person with a subjective blemish who thinks,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have a subjective blemish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and comprehends it as it really is,<br/>
					this one, of these two persons with a blemish,<br/>
					is shown to be the best man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where, your reverences,<br/>
					there is a person without a subjective blemish who thinks,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have no subjective blemish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">but does not comprehend it as it really is,<br/>
					this one, of these two persons without a blemish,<br/>

					<p class="f4">and comprehends it as it really is,<br/>
					this one, of these two persons without a blemish,<br/>
					is shown to be the best man."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					the venerable Moggallāna the Great spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, reverend Sāriputta, what is the cause,<br/>
					what the reason why,<br/>
					of these two persons with a blemish,<br/>
					one is shown as being the inferior man,<br/>
					while the other is shown as being the best man?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Where, your reverence,<br/>
					there is this person with a blemish who thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have a subjective blemish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">but who does not comprehend it as it really is,<br/>
					this may be expected for him:<br/>
					that he will not generate desire,<br/>
					or strive,<br/>
					or stir up energy<br/>
					for getting rid of that blemish;<br/>
					he will pass away while he has attachment,<br/>
					aversion,<br/>
					and confusion,<br/>
					while he has the blemish,<br/>
					while his mind is tarnished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your reverence, it is like a bronze bowl,<br/>
					brought back from a shop or smithy<br/>
					covered with dust and dirt<br/>
					and that the owners would not make use of or clean,<br/>
					but would throw away in the dust.</p>

					<p class="f4">In consequence, your reverence,<br/>
					would that bronze bowl<br/>
					become more tarnished with dirt after a time?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, your reverence,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence."</p>
