					<p class="f4">But this situation occurs, monks,<br/>
					when wanderers belonging to other sects<br/>

					void of recluses are other (systems teaching) alien views?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if there are wanderers belonging to other sects who speak thus,<br/>

					<p class="f4">It is, your reverences,<br/>

					that we speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are these four (kinds of) grasping.</p>
