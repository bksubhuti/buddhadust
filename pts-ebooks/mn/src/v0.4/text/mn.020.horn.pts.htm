					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anathapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk is intent on the higher thought,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					from time to time<br/>
					he should attend to five characteristics.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, whatever may be the characteristic which a monk attends to,<br/>
					if there arise evil unskilled thoughts associated with desire<br/>
					and associated with aversion<br/>
					and associated with confusion,<br/>
					that monk should attend,<br/>
					instead of to that characteristic,<br/>
					to another characteristic<br/>
					which is associated with what is skilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">By-attending to this other characteristic<br/>
					which is associated with what is skilled<br/>
					instead of to that characteristic,<br/>
					those evil unskilled thoughts<br/>
					associated with desire<br/>
					and associated with aversion<br/>
					and associated with confusion<br/>
					are got rid of,<br/>
					they come to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">From getting rid of these,<br/>
					his mind subjectively steadies,<br/>
					calms,<br/>
					is one-pointed,<br/>
					concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">As, monks, a skilled carpenter<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					or a carpenters apprentice<br/>
					might knock out,<br/>
					drive out,<br/>
					draw out<br/>
					a large peg with a small peg —<br/>
					even so, monks, whatever may be the characteristic which a monk attends to,<br/>
					if there arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/>
					associated with desire<br/>
					and associated with aversion<br/>
					and associated with confusion,<br/>
					that monk should attend,<br/>
					instead of to that characteristic,<br/>
					to another characteristic<br/>
					which is associated with what is skilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">By attending to this other characteristic<br/>
					which is associated with what is skilled<br/>
					instead of to that characteristic,<br/>
					those evil unskilled thoughts<br/>
					associated with desire<br/>
					and associated with aversion<br/>
					and associated with confusion —<br/>
					these are got rid of,<br/>
					these come to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">From getting rid of these,<br/>
					his mind subjectively steadies,<br/>
					calms,<br/>
					is one-pointed,<br/>
					concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if while the monk is attending,<br/>
					instead of to that characteristic,<br/>
					to this other characteristic<br/>
					which is associated with what is skilled,<br/>
					there still arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/>
					associated with desire<br/>
					and associated with aversion<br/>
					and associated with confusion,<br/>
					then the peril of these thoughts should be scrutinised by that monk, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed these are unskilled thoughts,<br/>
					indeed these are thoughts that have errors,<br/>
					indeed these are thoughts that are of painful results.'</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is scrutinising the peril of these thoughts,<br/>
					those evil unskilled thoughts that are associated with desire,<br/>
					associated with aversion,<br/>
					associated with confusion,<br/>
					these are got rid of,<br/>
					these come to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of these,<br/>
					his mind subjectively steadies,<br/>
					calms,<br/>
					is one-pointed,<br/>
					concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is like<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> a woman or a man,<br/>
					young,<br/>
					in the prime of life,<br/>
					fond of adornment,<br/>
					who, if the carcase of a snake<br/>
					or the carcase of a dog<br/>
					or the carcase of a human being<br/>
					were hanging round the neck,<br/>
					would be revolted,<br/>
					ashamed,<br/>
					disgusted —<br/>
					even so, monks, while the monk is attending,<br/>

					there still arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is like a man with vision<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, even as it might occur to a man<br/>
					who is walking quickly:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, why do I walk quickly?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to walk slowly?'</p>

					<p class="f4">It might occur to him<br/>
