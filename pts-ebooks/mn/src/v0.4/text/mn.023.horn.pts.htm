					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthi in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Kassapa the Boy<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> was staying in the Blind Men's Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the night was far spent<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> a certain deva<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> with a glorious skin,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> having illuminated the whole of the Blind Men's Grove, approached the venerable Kassapa the Boy; and having approached stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">While standing at one side this deva spoke thus to the venerable Kassapa the Boy:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'Monk, monk,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> this ant-hill smokes by night, blazes up by day.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">A brahman speaks thus:<br/>
					'Bringing a tool, clever one, dig it up.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The clever one, digging when he had brought a tool<br/>
					saw a bolt and said:<br/>
					'A bolt, revered one.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The brahman spoke thus:<br/>
					'Take out the bolt, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool,<br/>
					saw a frog,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> and said:<br/>
					'A frog, revered one.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The brahman spoke thus:<br/>
					'Take out the frog, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool,<br/>
					saw a forked path, and said:<br/>
					'A forked path, revered one.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The brahman spoke thus:<br/>
					'Take out the forked path, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The clever one, digging on when he had brought <span class="f3"><i>[184]</i></span> a tool,<br/>
					saw a strainer,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> and said:<br/>
					'A strainer, revered one.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The brahman spoke thus:<br/>
					<span class="f3"><b>[143]</b></span> 'Take out the strainer, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool,<br/>
					saw a tortoise, and said:<br/>
					'A tortoise, revered one.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The brahman spoke thus:<br/>
					'Take out the tortoise, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool,<br/>
					saw a slaughter-house,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> and said:<br/>
					'A slaughter-house, revered one.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The brahman spoke thus:<br/>
					'Take out the slaughter-house, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool,<br/>
					saw a piece of flesh, and said:<br/>
					'A piece of flesh, revered one.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The brahman spoke thus:<br/>
					'Take out the piece of flesh, dig on, clever one, bringing a tool.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The clever one, digging on when he had brought a tool,<br/>
					saw a cobra,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> and said:<br/>
					'A cobra, revered one.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The brahman spoke thus:<br/>
					'Let the cobra be,<br/>
					do not touch the cobra,<br/>
					do reverence to the cobra.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If you, monk, having approached the Lord, were to ask him about these questions, then you could remember as the Lord explains to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, monk, do not see anyone in the world with its devas, with its Māras, with its Brahmās, in creation, with its recluses and brahmans, its devas and men, who could turn his mind to expounding these questions except a Tathāgata or a Tathāgata's disciple or one who has heard (the teaching) from them."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke that deva; and vanished then and there, having said this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Kassapa the Boy approached the Lord towards the end of that night; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Kassapa the Boy spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"During this night, Lord, when the night was far spent, a certain deva with a glorious skin, having illumined the whole of the Blind Men's Grove, approached me; and having approached, stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">While standing to one side, Lord, that deva spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the deva said, Lord, and vanished then and there, having said this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what, Lord is the anthill,<br/>

					<hr class="demi"/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This is Kumāra-Kassapa, so called even when he was grown up, MA. ii. 120. He lived in Blind Men's Grove fulfilling the course for learners, MA. ii. 124. He took this sutta as the subject of his meditations and so developed insight and won arahantship, MA. ii. 134. He was therefore not an arahant at the time when it was delivered.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> This is the meaning attributed to abhikkantāya by MA. ii. 124 — the meaning of "waning" as against its other meaning of "lovely," "beautiful" and "wonderful" (in the sense of assenting).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> MA. ii. 124: "devatā" is the common (general or joint) appellation of devas, and daughters of devas. Here it means a deva." Cf. SA. ii. 14, which says here it means <i>devaputta</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> abhikkantavaṇṇā. MA. ii. 125 says abhikkanta is here in its sense of "beautiful," abhirūpa; and among seven meanings attributed to vaṇṇa, the first, that of "skin," chavi, is meant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> The deva and Kassapa had been two of five friends in the time of the Buddha Kassapa. Therefore the deva did not greet him, MA. ii. 126.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> uddhumāyikā = maṇḍūka, MA. ii. 128.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> caṅgavāra, explained at MA. ii. 128 as khāraparissāvanna, strainer for potash? Cf. cangavāraka at Miln. 365, translated as "dyers' straining cloth"; and Jā. v. 186, translated as "sieve." Jā. Comy. says "as water placed in a dyers' khāracaṅgavāra quickly runs out." Neumann's translation. Majjh., I 239, gives Geflecht, basket-work. Chalmers has "strainer."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> MA. ii. 128 say a large knife for cutting up meat as well as a block.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup>nāga.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> This description of the body occurs also at M. i. 500, ii. 17; <i>S.</i> iv. 83; <i>D.</i> i. 76.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> Cf. definition of brahman at A. iv. 144, quoted at MA. ii. 130.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> Cf. definition of <i>sikkhati ... sikkhati ... sekho</i> at A. i. 231, quoted at MA. ii. 131.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> MA. ii. 131, of bodily and mental energy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> MA. ii. 133 says that these are comparable to the four legs and the head of a tortoise.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a></sup> See end of Sta. 5, where the two chief disciples are referred to as mahānāga.</p>
