					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a sower does not sow a crop<br/>
