					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the brahman <span class="mozp">Jāṇussoṇi</span> was leaving Sāvatthī early in the day<br/>
					in an all-white chariot<br/>
					(drawn by) mares.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman <span class="mozp">Jāṇussoṇi</span> saw the wanderer Pilotika<br/>
					coming in the distance;<br/>
					seeing him,<br/>
					he spoke thus to the wanderer Pilotika:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, where is the revered Vacchāyana<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> coming from<br/>
					so early in the day?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, sir, am coming from the presence<br/>
					of the recluse Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Vacchāyana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Has the recluse Gotama lucidity of wisdom?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think him clever?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But who am I, sir,<br/>
					that I would know<br/>
					whether the recluse Gotama has lucidity of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely only one like him<br/>
					could know whether the recluse Gotama<br/>
					has lucidity of wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Undoubtedly it is with lofty praise<br/>
					that the revered Vacchāyana praises<br/>
					the recluse Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But who am I, sir,<br/>
					that I should praise the recluse Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">Praised by the praised<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					is the revered Gotama,<br/>
					chief among devas and men."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what good thing<br/>
					does the revered Vacchāyana see<br/>
					that he has this high confidence<br/>
					in the recluse Gotama?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, as a skilled elephant-tracker<br/>
					might enter an elephant-forest,<br/>
					and might see in the elephant-forest<br/>
					a great footprint,<br/>
					long and broad;<br/>
					he might come to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed it is a <span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span> great elephant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so did I, sir, when I had seen<br/>
					the four footprints of the recluse Gotama,<br/>
					come to this conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">The fully Self-awakened One is the Lord;<br/>
					well taught is <i>dhamma</i> by the Lord;<br/>
					the Order is faring along well.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">These hear:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Undoubtedly the recluse Gotama<br/>

					<p class="f4">On the contrary<br/>

					<p class="f4">When I, sir,<br/>

					<p class="f4">These speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed we were nearly lost,<br/>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					<span class="mozp">Jāṇussoṇi</span> the brahman got down from his all-white chariot<br/>
					(drawn by) mares,<br/>
					and having arranged his outer cloak over one shoulder,<br/>
					having saluted the Lord three times with joined palms,<br/>
					he uttered this utterance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverence to this Lord,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Reverence to this Lord,<br/>
					perfected one,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Reverence to this Lord,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps we,<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <span class="mozp">Jāṇussoṇi</span> the brahman approached the Lord;<br/>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>
					<span class="mozp">Jāṇussoṇi</span> the brahman<br/>

					<p class="f4">When he had spoken thus,<br/>
					the Lord spoke thus to <span class="mozp">Jāṇussoṇi</span> the brahman:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, to a (certain) extent<br/>
					the simile of the elephant's <span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span> footprints<br/>
					is not complete in all its detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, brahman,<br/>
					to the extent to which the simile of the elephant's footprints<br/>
					is complete in all its detail,<br/>
					listen,<br/>
					pay careful attention<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered one,"<br/>
					Jāṇussoṇi the brahman answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, an elephant tracker<br/>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, brahman,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He follows them<br/>

					<p class="f4">A skilled elephant tracker<br/>

					and who have large footprints,<br/>
					and he thinks<br/>
					this might be a footprint of theirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">He follows them<br/>
					and following them<br/>
					he sees in the elephant forest<br/>
					a great footprint,<br/>
					long and broad,<br/>

					<p class="f4">A skilled elephant tracker<br/>
					does not at once come to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed it is a great bull-elephant.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, brahman,<br/>
					in an elephant forest<br/>
					she-elephants with stumpy tusks<br/>
					who have large footprints,<br/>
					and he thinks<br/>
					this might be a footprint of theirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">He follows them<br/>
					and following them<br/>
					he sees in the elephant forest<br/>
					a great footprint,<br/>
					long and broad,<br/>
					and a grazing off of the high things<br/>

					and the high things broken off at the boughs.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sees that bull-elephant<br/>
					at the root of a tree<br/>

					or standing<br/>
					or sitting<br/>
					or lying down.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is that bull-elephant himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, brahman,<br/>
