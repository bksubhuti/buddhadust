					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the  Vajjis<br/>
					at Ukkācelā on the banks of the river Ganges.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered one,"<br/>
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Formerly, monks,<br/>
					an incompetent cowherd of Magadha<br/>
					in the last month of the rains<br/>
					at harvest time,<br/>
					without considering the hither bank of the river Ganges,<br/>
					without considering the further bank,<br/>
					drove his cattle across to the further bank<br/>
					in Suvidehā<br/>
					at a place where there was no ford.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the cattle huddled together<br/>
					in the middle of the stream of the river Ganges,<br/>
					got into difficulties and misfortune there.</p>

					<p class="f4">What was the cause?</p>

					<p class="f4">It was, monks,<br/>
					that that incompetent cowherd of Magadha<br/>
					in the last month of the rains<br/>
					at harvest time,<br/>
					without considering the hither bank of the river Ganges,<br/>
					without considering the further bank,<br/>
					drove the cattle across to the further bank<br/>
					in Suvidehā<br/>
					at a place where there was no ford.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks,<br/>
					any recluses or brahmans who are unskilled about this world,<br/>
					unskilled about the world beyond,<br/>
					unskilled about Māra's realm,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					unskilled about what is not Māra's realm,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					unskilled about Death's realm,<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> unskilled about what is not Death's realm<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					whoever think they should listen to these (recluses and brahmans)<br/>
					and put their faith in them,<br/>
					that will be for a long time<br/>
					for their woe and anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, monks,<br/>
					a competent cowherd of Magadha<br/>
					in the last month of the rains<br/>
					at harvest time,<br/>
					having considered the hither bank of the river Ganges,<br/>
					having considered the further <span class="f2 g"><b>[277]</b></span> bank,<br/>
					drove his cattle across to the further bank<br/>
					in Suvidehā<br/>
					at a place where there was a ford.</p>

					<p class="f4">First of all<br/>
					he drove across those bulls<br/>
					who were the sires and leaders of the herd -<br/>
					these, having cut across the stream of the Ganges,<br/>
					went safely beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he drove across<br/>
					the sturdy bullocks<br/>
					and young steers -<br/>
					these, also, having cut across the stream of the Ganges,<br/>
					went safely beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he drove across<br/>
					the half-grown bull-calves and heifers -<br/>
					these too, having cut across the stream of the Ganges,<br/>
					went safely beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he drove across<br/>
					the weaker calves -<br/>
					these too, having cut across the stream of the Ganges,<br/>
					went safely beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time<br/>
					there was a young new-born calf<br/>
					which, by following the lowing of its mother,<br/>
					also cut across the stream of the Ganges<br/>
					and went safely beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">What was the cause of this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It was, monks,<br/>
					that that cowherd of Magadha<br/>
					in the last month of the rains<br/>
					at harvest time,<br/>
					having considered the hither bank of the river Ganges,<br/>
					having considered the further bank,<br/>
					drove his cattle across to the further bank<br/>
					in Suvidehā<br/>
					at a place where there was a ford.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks,<br/>
					any recluses or brahmans<br/>
					who are skilled about this world,<br/>
					skilled about the world beyond,<br/>
					skilled about Māra's realm,<br/>
					skilled about what is not Māra's realm,<br/>
					skilled about Death's realm,<br/>
					skilled about what is not Death's realm -<br/>
					whoever think they should listen to these (recluses and brahmans)<br/>
					and put their faith in them,<br/>
					that will be for a long time<br/>
					for their welfare and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, like unto those bulls<br/>
					who were the sires and leaders of the herd,<br/>
					and who, having cut across the stream of the Ganges,<br/>
					went safely beyond,<br/>
					are those monks who are perfected ones,<br/>
					the cankers destroyed,<br/>
					who have lived the life,<br/>
					done what was to be done,<br/>
					laid down the burden,<br/>
					attained their own goal,<br/>
					the fetters of becoming being utterly destroyed,<br/>
					and who are freed by perfect profound knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">For these,<br/>
					having cut across Māra's stream,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					have gone safely beyond.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, like unto those sturdy bullocks<br/>
					and young steers<br/>
					who, having cut across the stream of the Ganges,<br/>
					went safely beyond,<br/>
					are those monks who,<br/>
					by destroying the five fetters<br/>
					binding to this lower world,<br/>
					are of spontaneous uprising,<br/>
					and being ones who attain <i>nibbāna</i> there,<br/>
					are not liable to return from that world.</p>

					<p class="f4">For these also,<br/>
					having cut across Māra's stream,<br/>
					will go safely beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[279]</b></span> Monks, like unto those half-grown bull-calves and heifers<br/>
					who, having cut across the stream of the Ganges,<br/>
					went safely beyond,<br/>
					are those monks who,<br/>
					by destroying the three fetters,<br/>
					by reducing attachment, aversion and confusion,<br/>
					are once-returners<br/>
					who, having come back again to this world once only,<br/>
					will make an end of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">For these also,<br/>
					having cut across Māra's stream,<br/>
					will go safely beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, like unto those weaker calves<br/>
					who, having cut across the stream of the Ganges,<br/>
					went safely beyond,<br/>
					are those monks who, by destroying the three fetters,<br/>
					are stream-attainers,<br/>
					not liable for the abyss,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">For these also,<br/>
					having cut across Māra's stream,<br/>
					will go safely beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, like unto that young new-born calf<br/>
					which, by following the lowing of its mother,<br/>
					also cut across the stream of the Ganges<br/>
					and went safely beyond,<br/>
					are those monks who are striving for <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					striving for faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">For these also,<br/>
					having cut across Māra's stream,<br/>
					will go safely beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I, monks, am skilled about this world,<br/>
					skilled about the world beyond,<br/>
					skilled about Māra's realm,<br/>
					skilled about what is not Māra's realm,<br/>
					skilled about Death's realm,<br/>
					skilled about what is not Death's realm.</p>

					<p class="f4">To those who think they should listen to me<br/>
					and place faith in me,<br/>
					there will be welfare and happiness<br/>
					for a long time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord;<br/>
					the Well-farer having said this,<br/>
					the Teacher then spoke thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"This world, the world beyond, are well explained by the one who knows,<br/>
							And what is accessible by Māra and what is not accessible by Death.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">By the Self-awakened One, comprehending, thoroughly knowing every world,<br/>
							Opened is the door of the Undying<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> for reaching security - <i>nibbāna</i>.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Cut across is the stream of the Evil One, shattered, destroyed;<br/>
							Let there be abundant rapture, monks, let security be reached."</p>
