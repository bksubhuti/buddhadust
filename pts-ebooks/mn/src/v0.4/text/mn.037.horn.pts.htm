					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in the Eastern Monastery<br/>
					in the palace of Migāra's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br/>
					Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Briefly, Lord, to what extent<br/>
					does a monk come to be freed<br/>
					by the destruction of craving,<br/>
					completely fulfilled,<br/>
					completely secure from the bonds,<br/>
					a complete Brahma-farer,<br/>
					complete as to his culmination,<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> best of <i>devas</i> and men?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					a monk comes to hear:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not fitting<br/>
					that there should be inclination<br/>
					towards any (psycho-physical) conditions.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If, lord of <i>devas</i>, a monk comes to hear this, that</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not fitting<br/>
					that there should be inclination<br/>
					towards any (psycho-physical) conditions,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he knows all the conditions thoroughly;<br/>
					by knowing all the conditions thoroughly<br/>
					he knows all the conditions accurately;<br/>
					by knowing all the conditions accurately,<br/>
					whatever feeling he feels,<br/>
					pleasant<br/>
					or painful<br/>
					or neither painful nor pleasant,<br/>
					he abides viewing impermanence,<br/>
					he abides viewing dispassion,<br/>
					he abides viewing stopping,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					he abides viewing renunciation<br/>
					in regard to those feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is abiding viewing impermanence,<br/>
					when he is abiding viewing dispassion,<br/>
					when he is abiding viewing stopping,<br/>
					when he is abiding viewing renunciation<br/>
					in regard to these feelings,<br/>
					he grasps after nothing in the world;<br/>
					not grasping<br/>
					he is not troubled;<br/>
					being untroubled he himself is <span class="f2 g"><b>[307]</b></span><br/>
					individually attained to <i>nibbāna</i>,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> and he comprehends:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br/>
					brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br/>
					done is what was to be done,<br/>
					there is no more of being such or such'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Briefly, it is to this extent, lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					that a monk comes to be freed<br/>
					by the destruction of craving,<br/>
					completely fulfilled,<br/>
					completely secure from the bonds,<br/>
					a complete Brahma-farer,<br/>
					complete as to his culmination,<br/>
					best of <i>devas</i> and men."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					having rejoiced in what the Lord had said,<br/>
					having given thanks,<br/>
					having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					vanished then and there<br/>
					keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/>
					was sitting down near the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, did that yakkha,<br/>
					when he thanked the Lord for his words,<br/>
					grasp them or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I should find out<br/>
					whether that yakkha,<br/>
					when he thanked the Lord for his words,<br/>
					grasped them or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/>
					as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm<br/>
					or might bend back his out-stretched arm,<br/>
					vanishing from the palace of Migāra's mother in the Eastern Monastery,<br/>
					appeared among the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					equipped and provided with five hundred deva-like musical instruments,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					was amusing himself in the One Lotus pleasure grove.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					saw the venerable Moggallāna the Great coming in the distance;<br/>
					seeing him,<br/>
					having had those five hundred deva-like musical instruments stopped,<br/>
					he approached the venerable Moggallāna the Great;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					he spoke thus to the venerable Moggal-lāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					you are welcome, my good Moggallāna;<br/>
					at last, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					you take this occasion for coming here;<br/>
					sit down, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					this seat is appointed."</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Moggallāna the Great sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					having taken a low seat,<br/>
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/>
					spoke thus to Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[308]</b></span> "In regard to the talk that the Lord spoke in brief to you, Kosiya,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					on freedom by the destruction of craving,<br/>
					it were good even for me to hear portions of this talk."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, my good Moggallāna, am very busy,<br/>
					there is much to be done by me;<br/>
					both on my own account there are things to be done,<br/>
					and there are also (still more)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> things to be done<br/>
					for the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					it was properly heard,<br/>
					properly learnt,<br/>
					properly attended to,<br/>
					properly reflected upon,<br/>
					so that it cannot vanish quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					a battle was in full swing between <i>devas</i> and demons.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that battle, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					the <i>devas</i> conquered,<br/>
					the demons were defeated.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					having won that battle<br/>
					and being victorious in the, battle,<br/>
					when I came back from there<br/>
					built a palace named Vejayanta<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> (Victory).</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					there are a hundred towers to the Vejayanta Palace,<br/>
					in each tower there are seven gabled houses,<br/>
					in each gabled house there are seven nymphs,<br/>
					and for each nymph there are seven attendants.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would you, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					like to see the delights of the Vejayanta Palace?"</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Moggallāna the Great consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					and the great rajah Vessavaṇa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> having put the venerable Moggallāna the Great in front of them<br/>
					approached Vejayanta Palace.</p>

					<p class="f4">The female attendants of Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					saw the venerable Moggallāna the Great coming in the distance;<br/>
					on seeing him,<br/>
					shrinking and shy,<br/>
					each entered her own inner room.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a daughter-in-law<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> shrinks and is shy on seeing her father-in-law,<br/>
					even so did the female attendants of Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					on seeing the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/>
					shrinking and shy,<br/>
					each enter her own inner room.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>, and Vessavaṇa, the great rajah,<br/>
					made the <span class="f2 g"><b>[309]</b></span> venerable Moggallāna the Great follow them into the Vejayanta Palace<br/>
					and roam about in it,<br/>
					and (they said):</p>

					<p class="f4">"My dear Moggallāna, see this delight of the Vejayanta Palace, and,<br/>
					dear Moggallāna, see that delight of the Vejayanta Palace."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This shines forth as a deed of merit<br/>
					formerly done by the venerable Kosiya,<br/>
					and people seeing anything delightful speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed it shines forth from the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three,<br/>
					that is to say it shines forth as a deed of merit<br/>
					formerly done by the venerable Kosiya.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This <i>yakkha</i> lives much too indolently.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I were to agitate this <i>yakkha?'</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/>
					worked such a working of psychic power<br/>
					that with his big toe he made Vejayanta Palace<br/>
					tremble, shake and quake.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the minds of Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					and of the great rajah Vessavaṇa<br/>
					and of the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three<br/>
					were full of wonder and marvel, and they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, the great psychic power,<br/>
					the great majesty<br/>
					of the recluse is wonderful,<br/>
					it is indeed marvellous,<br/>
					inasmuch as with his big toe<br/>
					he makes this <i>deva</i>-like abode<br/>
					tremble, shake and quake."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/>
					knowing that Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					was agitated and astounded,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> spoke thus to Sakka, the lord of devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In regard to the talk that the Lord spoke in brief to you, Kosiya,<br/>
					on freedom by the destruction of craving,<br/>
					it were good even for me to hear portions of that talk."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to that I, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					I stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I was standing at a respectful distance, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					I spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Briefly, Lord, to what extent<br/>
					does a monk come to be freed by the destruction of craving,<br/>
					completely fulfilled,<br/>
					completely secure from the bonds,<br/>
					a complete Brahma-farer,<br/>
					complete as to his culmination,<br/>
					best of <i>devas</i> and men?</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					the Lord spoke thus to me;</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not fitting<br/>
					that there should be inclination<br/>
					towards any (psycho-physical) conditions.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, lord of <i>devas</i>, a monk comes to hear this, that</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not fitting<br/>
					that there should be inclination<br/>
					towards any (psycho-physical) conditions,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he knows all the conditions thoroughly;<br/>
					by knowing all the conditions thoroughly<br/>
					he knows all the conditions accurately;<br/>
					by knowing all the conditions accurately,<br/>
					whatever feeling he feels,<br/>
					pleasant<br/>
					or painful<br/>
					or neither painful nor pleasant,<br/>
					he abides viewing impermanence,<br/>
					he abides viewing dispassion,<br/>
					he abides viewing stopping,<br/>
					he abides viewing renunciation<br/>
					in regard to those feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is abiding viewing impermanence,<br/>
					when he is abiding viewing dispassion,<br/>
					when he is abiding viewing stopping,<br/>
					when he is abiding viewing renunciation<br/>
					in regard to these feelings,<br/>
					he grasps after nothing in the world;<br/>
					not grasping<br/>
					he is not troubled;<br/>
					being untroubled he himself is<br/>
					individually attained to <i>nibbāna</i>, and he comprehends:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br/>
					brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br/>
					done is what was to be done,<br/>
					there is no more of being such or such'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Briefly, it is to this extent, lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					that a monk comes to be freed by the destruction of craving,<br/>
					completely fulfilled,<br/>
					completely secure from the bonds,<br/>
					a complete Brahma-farer,<br/>
					complete as to his culmination,<br/>
					best of <i>devas</i> and <span class="f2 g"><b>[310]</b></span> men.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, my good Moggallāna,<br/>
					did the Lord speak to me briefly<br/>
					on freedom by the destruction of craving."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/>
					having rejoiced in what Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>, had said,<br/>
					having given thanks,<br/>
					as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm<br/>
					or might bend back his outstretched arm,<br/>
					vanishing even so<br/>
					from among the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three,<br/>
					did he become manifest in the palace of Migāra's mother<br/>
					in the Eastern Monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then soon after the venerable Moggallāna the Great had departed,<br/>
					the female attendants of Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					spake thus to Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sir, is not this lord your teacher?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good ladies, this lord is not my teacher,<br/>
					he is a fellow Brahma-farer of mine,<br/>
					the venerable Moggallāna the Great."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a gain for you, good sir,<br/>
					that this fellow Brahma-farer of yours<br/>
					is of such great psychic potency,<br/>
					of such great majesty;<br/>
					certainly this lord is your teacher."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>
					the venerable Moggallāna the Great spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, does the Lord know<br/>
					that just now he spoke in brief<br/>
					on freedom by the destruction of craving<br/>
					to a very powerful <i>yakkha?"</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"I know, Moggallāna,<br/>
					that Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/>
					approached me here;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					having greeted me,<br/>
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br/>
					Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>, spoke thus to me, Moggallāna:</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, I, Moggallāna,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'As to this, lord of <i>devas</i>, a monk comes to hear:</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is <span class="f2 g"><b>[311]</b></span> abiding viewing impermanence,<br/>
					when he is abiding viewing dispassion,<br/>
					when he is abiding viewing stopping,<br/>
