					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the Aṅgas;<br/>
					a township of the Aṅgas was called Assapura.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[335]</b></span> "Revered one,"<br/>
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Recluses, recluses,'<br/>
					so the people know you, monks,<br/>
					and you, on being asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who are yon?'</p>

					<p class="f4">should acknowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We are recluses.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such being your, designations, monks,<br/>
					such being your vocations,<br/>
					thus you should train yourselves, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will follow those practices<br/>
					which are fitting for recluses;<br/>
					thus will this designation of ours<br/>
					become true<br/>
					and the vocation real;<br/>
					and the gifts of those things we make use of -<br/>
					robe-material,<br/>
					almsfood,<br/>
					lodging,<br/>
					medicines for the sick -<br/>
					will come to be of great fruit,<br/>
					of great advantage to us;<br/>
					and this our going forth<br/>
					will come to be not barren<br/>
					but fruitful<br/>
					and growing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk come to be one<br/>
					who is not following the practice<br/>
					that is fitting for recluses?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in any monk who is covetous,<br/>
					covetousness not got rid of;<br/>
					who is malevolent in mind,<br/>
					malevolence not got rid of;<br/>
					who is wrathful,<br/>
					wrath not got rid of;<br/>
					who is grudging,<br/>
					grudging not got rid of;<br/>

					treachery not got rid of;<br/>

					craftiness not got rid of;<br/>
					who is of evil desires,<br/>
					evil desires not got rid of;<br/>
					who is of wrong view,<br/>
					wrong view not got rid of -<br/>
					I, monks, say<br/>
					that if he does not follow<br/>
					the practice fitting for recluses,<br/>
					there is no getting rid of these stains on recluses,<br/>
					defects in recluses,<br/>
					faults in recluses,<br/>
					occasions for the sorrowful states,<br/>
					of what is to be experienced in a bad bourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as a deadly weapon<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> for fighting with,<br/>
					double-edged<br/>
					and whetted sharp,<br/>
					may be covered<br/>
					and enveloped<br/>
					by his outer cloak -<br/>
					unto this do I, monks,<br/>
					liken this monk's going forth.</p>
