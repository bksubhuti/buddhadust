					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For the most part, monks,<br/>

					desire like this,<br/>
					intend like this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 may unpleasant,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, monks, listen,<br/>
