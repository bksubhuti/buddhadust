					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Now, Lord, the monks of Kosambī,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Then it is to be said, monks,<br/>
					that at that time when you,<br/>

					<p class="f4">You neither convince one another<br/>
					nor are convinced yourselves,<br/>
					neither do you win one another over<br/>
