					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"At one time I, monks, was staying at Ukkaṭṭhā<br/>
					in the Subhaga Grove<br/>
					near the great sāl-tree.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At that time, monks,<br/>
					an evil wrong view<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					came to have accrued to Baka the Brahmā<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					like this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is permanent,<br/>
					this is stable,<br/>
					this is eternal,<br/>
					this is entire,<br/>
					this is not liable to passing away,<br/>
					this is not born,<br/>
					does not age,<br/>
					does not die,<br/>
					does not pass away,<br/>
					does not uprise,<br/>
					and there is not another further escape from this.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then did I, monks,<br/>
					knowing with my mind<br/>
					the reasoning in the mind of Baka the Brahmā,<br/>
					as a <span class="f2 g"><b>[389]</b></span> strong man might bend back his outstretched arm<br/>
					or might stretch out his bent arm,<br/>
					so, vanishing from near the great sāl-tree<br/>
					in the Subhaga Grove at Ukkaṭṭhā,<br/>
					did I appear in that Brahma-world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, Baka the Brahmā saw me coming in the distance;<br/>
					seeing me, he spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good sir,<br/>
					you are welcome, good sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">At last, good sir,<br/>
					you make this occasion for coming here.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But this, good sir, is permanent,<br/>
					this is stable,<br/>
					this is eternal,<br/>
					this is entire,<br/>
					this is not liable to passing away,<br/>
					this is not born,<br/>
					nor does it age<br/>
					or die<br/>
					or pass away<br/>
					or uprise,<br/>
					and there is not another further escape from this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					I, monks, spoke thus to Baka the Brahma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, Baka the Brahma is steeped in ignorance,<br/>
					indeed, Baka the Brahma is steeped in ignorance,<br/>
					inasmuch as he says</p>

					<p class="f4">"permanent"<br/>
					although it is indeed impermanent,<br/>
					"stable"<br/>
					although it is indeed unstable,<br/>
					"eternal"<br/>
					although it is indeed not eternal,<br/>
					"entire"<br/>
					although it is indeed not entire,<br/>
					"not liable to passing away"<br/>
					although it is indeed liable to passing away,<br/>
					and because in regard to what is born,<br/>
					and ages<br/>
					and dies<br/>
					and passes away<br/>
					and uprises,<br/>
					he says:<br/>
					"This is not born,<br/>
					nor does it age<br/>
					or die<br/>
					or pass away<br/>
					or uprise,"<br/>
					and although there is another further escape,<br/>
					he says:<br/>
					"There is not another further escape."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Māra the Evil One,<br/>
					having entered a certain company of Brahmas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monk, monk,<br/>
					do not meddle with this,<br/>
					do not meddle with this.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, monk,<br/>
					this Brahmā<br/>
					is a Great Brahmā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					Victor,<br/>
					Unvanquished,<br/>

					Lord,<br/>
					Maker,<br/>
					Creator,<br/>
					Chief,<br/>
					Disposer,<br/>
					Master,<br/>
					Father of all that have become<br/>
					and will be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you<br/>
					who scorned extension,<br/>
					loathed extension,<br/>
					who scorned cohesion,<br/>
					loathed cohesion,<br/>
					who scorned heat,<br/>

					who scorned Brahmā,<br/>
					loathed Brahmā<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					these at the breaking up of the body,<br/>
					at the Cutting off of life,<br/>
					were established in a low group.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But, monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you, <span class="f2 g"><b>[390]</b></span> who lauded extension,<br/>
					delighted in extension,<br/>
					who lauded cohesion,<br/>
					delighted in cohesion,<br/>
					who lauded heat,<br/>
					delighted in heat,<br/>
					who lauded motion,<br/>
					delighted in motion,<br/>
					who lauded creatures,<br/>
					delighted in creatures,<br/>
					who lauded devas,<br/>
					delighted in devas,<br/>
					who lauded Pajāpati,<br/>
					delighted in Pajāpati,<br/>
					who lauded Brahmā,<br/>
					delighted in Brahmā -<br/>
					these at the breaking up of the body,<br/>
					at the cutting off of life,<br/>
					were established in an excellent group.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On account of this do I, monk, speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Please do you, good sir,<br/>
					do exactly what Brahmā says to you,<br/>
					do not go beyond Brahmā's word.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you, monk, should go beyond Brahmā's word,<br/>
					it will be with you, monk,<br/>
					as with a man who might beat back approaching glory<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> with a stick,<br/>
					or, monk, as with a man who might miss<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> the earth<br/>
					with his hands and feet<br/>
					as he was falling down hell's precipices.</p>

					<p class="f4">Please do you, good sir,<br/>
					do exactly what Brahmā says to you,<br/>
					do not go beyond Brahmā's word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not you, monk,<br/>
					see the seated company of Brahmā?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so, monks, Māra the Evil One<br/>
					conducted me to the company of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had spoken thus,<br/>
					I, monks, spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, Evil One, know you;<br/>
					do not think that I do not know you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māra, you are the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whoever, Evil One,<br/>
					is a Brahmā,<br/>
					and whatever are Brahmā-companies,<br/>
					and whatever are Brahmā-conclaves,<br/>
					all are in your grasp,<br/>
					all are in your power.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurs to you thus, Evil One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let this one too be in my grasp,<br/>
					let this one too be in my power.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I, Evil One, am not in your grasp,<br/>
					I am not in your power.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When I had said this, monks,<br/>
					Baka the Brahmā spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But I, good sir, say "permanent"<br/>
					because it is permanent,<br/>
					I say "stable"<br/>
					because it is stable,<br/>
					I say "eternal"<br/>
					because it is eternal,<br/>
					I say "entire"<br/>
					because it is entire,<br/>
					I say "not liable to passing away"<br/>
					because it is not liable to passing away,<br/>
					and of what is not born,<br/>
					does not age,<br/>
					die,<br/>
					pass away<br/>
					and uprise,<br/>
					this is just what I say:<br/>
					"This is not born,<br/>
					it does not age,<br/>
					it does not die,<br/>
					it does not pass away,<br/>
					it does not uprise;"<br/>
					and because there is not another further escape,<br/>
					I say, "There is not another further escape."</p>

					<p class="f4">There were, monk, recluses and brahmans in the world before you<br/>
					who practised austerities<br/>
					for a term as long as your whole life.</p>

					<p class="f4">These would know thus:<br/>
					either, if there is another further escape:<br/>
					There is another further escape;<br/>
					or, if there is not another further escape:<br/>
					There is not another further escape.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, monk, say this to you:</p>

					<p class="f4">You will never see another further escape<br/>
					however <span class="f2 g"><b>[391]</b></span> much yon may go in for toil and trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you, monk, would ascertain<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> extension,<br/>
					you will become near to me,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain cohesion,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain heat,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain <i>devas,</i><br/>
					you will become near to me,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain Pajāpati,<br/>
					you will become near to me,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain Brahmā,<br/>
					you will become near to me,<br/>
					reposing on my substance,<br/>
					to be done to as I will,<br/>
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">'But I too, Brahma, know this:</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to ascertain extension,<br/>
					I will become near to you,<br/>
					reposing on your substance,<br/>
					to be done to as you will,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If I were to ascertain cohesion,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Moreover I both comprehend your bourn, Brahmā,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But there are, Brahmā,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā<br/>

					<p class="f4">For a people delighting in becoming,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Māra the Evil One,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'If you, good sir, know thus,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you,<br/>

					they taught <i>dhamma</i> to disciples<br/>

					they craved for disciples<br/>
					and for those <span class="f2 g"><b>[394]</b></span> who had gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, having communicated to disciples<br/>
					and to those who had gone forth,<br/>
					having taught <i>dhamma</i> to disciples<br/>
					and to those who had gone forth,<br/>
					having craved for disciples<br/>
					and for those who had gone forth,<br/>
					at the breaking up of the body,<br/>
					at the cutting off of life,<br/>
					were established in a low group.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you,<br/>
					claiming to be perfected ones,<br/>
					fully self-awakened ones;<br/>
					these did not communicate to disciples<br/>
					or to those who had gone forth;<br/>
					they did not teach <i>dhamma</i> to disciples<br/>
					or to those who had gone forth;<br/>
					they did not crave for disciples<br/>
					or for those who had gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, not having communicated to disciples<br/>
					or to those who had gone forth,<br/>
					not having taught <i>dhamma</i> to disciples<br/>
					or to those who had gone forth,<br/>
					not having craved for disciples<br/>
					or for those who had gone forth,<br/>

					at the cutting off of life,<br/>
					were established in an excellent group.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So I speak thus to you, monk:</p>

					<p class="f4">Please do you, good sir,<br/>
					dwell untroubled<br/>
					and intent on abiding in ease here and now.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What is skill<br/>
					is not pointing out,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a></sup></span> good sir,<br/>
					so do not instruct others.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, I, monks,<br/>
					spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know you, Evil One,<br/>
					do not think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He does not know me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil One, you are Māra.</p>

					<p class="f4">You do not speak to me thus, Evil One,<br/>
					because you are friendly<br/>
					and compassionate;<br/>
					you speak to me thus, Evil One,<br/>
					because you are not friendly,<br/>
					not compassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you think thus, Evil One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Those to whom the recluse Gotama teaches <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					will get beyond my reach.</p>

					<p class="f4">Although those recluses and brahmans, Evil One,<br/>
					who claimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We are fully self-awakened ones,"</p>

					<p class="f4">were not fully self-awakened ones,<br/>
					nevertheless I, Evil One,<br/>
					who claim:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am a fully self-awakened one,"</p>

					<p class="f4">am indeed a fully self-awakened one.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Evil One,<br/>
					whether a Tathāgata is teaching <i>dhamma</i> to disciples,<br/>
					he is such a one;<br/>
					whether, Evil One,<br/>
					a <i>Tathāgata</i> is not teaching <i>dhamma</i> to disciples,<br/>
					he is such a one;<br/>
					whether, Evil One,<br/>
					a <i>Tathāgata</i> is communicating it to disciples,<br/>
					he is such a one;<br/>
					whether, Evil One,<br/>
					a Tathāgata is not communicating it to disciples,<br/>
					he is such a one.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil One, in a <i>Tathāgata</i><br/>
					those cankers which are connected with the defilements,<br/>
					with again-becoming,<br/>
					fearful,<br/>
					whose results are anguish,<br/>
					which make for birth,<br/>
					ageing and dying <span class="f2 g"><b>[395]</b></span> in the future,<br/>
					these are got rid of,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump<br/>
					so that they can come to no further existence in the future.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Evil One,<br/>
					as a palm-tree whose crown has been cut off<br/>
					cannot put forth growth again,<br/>
					even so, Evil One,<br/>
					in a Tathāgata those cankers which are connected with the defilements,<br/>
					with again-becoming,<br/>
					fearful,<br/>
					whose results are anguish,<br/>
					which make for birth,<br/>
					ageing and dying in the future,<br/>
					these are got rid of,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump<br/>
					that can come to no further existence in the future.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of Māra's failure to persuade (me)<br/>
					and because of the invitation to a Brahmā,<br/>
					a synonym for this homily is therefore<br/>
					A challenge to a Brahmā."</p>
