					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Aṅguttarāpa.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Āpaṇa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> was a market town in Aṅguttarāpa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,<br/>
					taking his bowl and robe,<br/>
					entered Āpaṇa for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had walked for almsfood in Āpaṇa<br/>
					and was returning from the alms-gathering after the meal,<br/>
					he approached a certain forest-thicket for the day-sojourn;<br/>
					and having plunged into that forest-thicket<br/>
					he sat down at the root of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the householder Potaliya,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					who was constantly pacing up and down<br/>
					and roaming about on foot,<br/>
					fully dressed<span class="f3"><sup>4</sup></span> and clothed,<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					with parasol and slippers,<br/>
					approached that forest-thicket;<br/>
					having plunged into that forest-thicket,<br/>
					he approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br/>
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus<br/>
					to the householder Potaliya<br/>
					as he was standing at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are seats, householder;<br/>
					if you wish,<br/>
					do sit down."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					the householder Potaliya<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama addresses me<br/>
					with the word 'householder'",<br/>
					angry,<br/>
					displeased,<br/>
					became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time<br/>
					the Lord spoke thus to the householder Potaliya:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are <span class="f2 g"><b>[26]</b></span> seats, householder;<br/>
					if you wish,<br/>
					do sit down."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time<br/>
					the householder Potaliya<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama addresses me<br/>
					with the word 'householder'",<br/>
					angry,<br/>
					displeased,<br/>
					became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time<br/>
					the Lord spoke thus to the householder Potaliya:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are seats, householder;<br/>
					if you wish,<br/>
					do sit down."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					the householder Potaliya<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama addresses me<br/>
					with the word 'householder'",<br/>
					angry,<br/>
					displeased,<br/>
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This,<span class="f2">[360]</span>good Gotama, is not proper,<br/>
					it is not suitable,<br/>
					that you should address me<br/>
					with the word 'householder.' "</p>

					<p class="f4">"But you, householder,<br/>
					have all the characteristic marks and signs<br/>
					of a householder."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But all relevant occupations<br/>
					have been abandoned by me, good Gotama,<br/>
					all avocations given up."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, householder,<br/>
					how have all occupations been abandoned by you,<br/>
					all avocations given up?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, good Gotama,<br/>
					I handed over to my sons<br/>
					as their inheritance<br/>
					all that I had of wealth<br/>
					or grain<br/>
					or silver<br/>
					or gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without giving advice or blame in these matters<br/>
					I live on a minimum<br/>
					of food and covering.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is how all occupations have been abandoned by me, good Gotama,<br/>
					all avocations given up."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what you, householder, call<br/>
					a giving up of avocations<br/>
					is one thing;<br/>
					but in the discipline for an ariyan<br/>
					the giving up of avocations<br/>
					is another thing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, revered sir,<br/>
					is the giving up of avocations<br/>
					in the discipline for an ariyan?</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, revered sir,<br/>
					if the Lord were to teach me dhamma<br/>
					as to that which is the giving up of avocations<br/>
					in the discipline for an ariyan."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, householder, listen,<br/>
					attend carefully<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>
					the householder Potaliya answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, these eight things<br/>
					conduce to the giving up of avocations<br/>
					in the discipline for an ariyan.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Through no onslaught on creatures,<br/>

					<p class="f4">through taking what is given,<br/>

					<p class="f4">through speaking truth,<br/>
					lying speech should be got rid of;</p>

					<p class="f4">through unslanderous speech,<br/>
					slanderous speech should be got rid of;</p>

					<p class="f4">through non-covetise and greed,<br/>
					covetise and greed should be got rid of;</p>

					<p class="f4">through no angry fault-finding,<br/>
					angry fault-finding should be got <span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span> rid of;</p>

					<p class="f4">through no wrathful rage,<br/>
					wrathful rage should be got rid of;</p>

					<p class="f4">through no arrogance,<br/>
					arrogance should be got rid of.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the eight things, householder,<br/>
					spoken of in brief,<br/>
					not explained in detail,<br/>
					that, in the discipline for an ariyan,<br/>
					conduce to the giving up of avocations."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to these eight things, revered sir,<br/>
					which are spoken of in brief,<br/>
					not explained in detail,<br/>
					and which, in the discipline for an ariyan,<br/>
					conduce to the giving up of avocations,<br/>
					it were good, revered sir,<br/>
					if the Lord<br/>
					out of compassion<br/>
					were to explain these eight things to me in detail."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, householder, listen,<br/>
