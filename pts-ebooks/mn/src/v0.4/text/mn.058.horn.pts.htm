					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince Abhaya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> approached Nātaputta the Jain;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					having greeted Nātaputta the Jain,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Nātaputta the Jain spoke thus<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to Prince Abhaya<br/>
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, Prince,<br/>

					so that a lovely reputation goes forth about you<br/>
					to the effect that the recluse Gotama<br/>
					of such great psychic power,<br/>

					was refuted by Prince Abhaya."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how can I, revered sir,<br/>
					refute the recluse Gotama<br/>
					who is of such great psychic power,<br/>
					of such great majesty?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, Prince,<br/>
					approach the recluse Gotama;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					speak thus to the recluse Gotama:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, revered sir, could a Tathāgata utter a speech<br/>
					that is disliked by others,<br/>
					disagreeable to them?'</p>

					<p class="f4">If the recluse Gotama<br/>

					should answer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Prince, a Tathāgata could utter a speech<br/>

					<p class="f4">then you should speak to him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then how is it, revered sir,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, revered sir,"<br/>

					having answered Nātaputta the Jain in assent,<br/>
					rising from his seat,<br/>
					having greeted Nātaputta the Jain<br/>
					keeping his right side towards him,<br/>
					approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Alter looking at the sun,<br/>
					it occurred to Prince Abhaya<br/>
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not the right time today<br/>
					to refute the Lord,<br/>
					but tomorrow I,<br/>
					in my own house,<br/>
					will refute the Lord,"<br/>
					and he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, may the Lord consent<br/>
					to take a meal with me on the morrow<br/>
					with three others?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince Abhaya,<br/>
					having understood the lord's consent,<br/>
					rising from his seat,<br/>
					having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>
					at the end of that night,<br/>
					having dressed in the early morning,<br/>
					taking his bowl and robe,<br/>
					approached Prince Abhaya's dwelling;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					he sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince Abhaya<br/>
					with his own hand<br/>
					served and satisfied the Lord<br/>
					with sumptuous solid and soft <span class="f2 g"><b>[62]</b></span> foods.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the Lord had eaten<br/>
					and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br/>
					Prince Abhaya, taking a low seat,<br/>
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Prince Abhaya, sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, revered sir,<br/>
					could a Tathāgata utter a speech disliked by others,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Is not this one-sided,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> Prince?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"At this point, revered sir,<br/>
					the Jains have lost."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Why do you speak thus, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[394]</span> 'At this point, revered sir, the Jains have lost'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, I, revered sir, approached Nātaputta the Jain;<br/>

					<p class="f4">At that time an innocent little baby boy<br/>
					was lying on its back<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					on Prince Abhaya's knees.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus to Prince Abhaya:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What <span class="f2">[395]</span> do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">If this boy<br/>
					owing to your carelessness<br/>
					or that of his nurse<br/>
					were to put a stick or stone into his mouth,<br/>
					what would you do for him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would get it out, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if I, revered sir,<br/>
					were not able to get it out at once,<br/>
					then taking hold of his head with my left hand,<br/>
					crooking a finger,<br/>
					I would get it out with my right hand,<br/>
					even though it were with blood.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, I have compassion for the boy."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Prince,<br/>
					whatever speech the Tathāgata knows to be not fact,<br/>
					not true,<br/>
					not connected with the goal,<br/>
					and that is not liked by others,<br/>
					disagreeable to them,<br/>
					that speech the Tathāgata does not utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever speech a Tathāgata knows to be fact,<br/>

					but not connected with the goal,<br/>
					and not liked by others,<br/>
					disagree- <span class="f2 g"><b>[63]</b></span> able to them,<br/>
					neither does the Tathāgata utter that speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever speech the Tathāgata knows to be fact,<br/>

					connected with the goal,<br/>
					but not liked by others,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And whatever speech the Tathāgata knows to be fact,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And whatever speech the Tathāgata knows to be fact,<br/>

					and liked by others,<br/>
					agreeable to them,<br/>
					the Tathāgata is aware of the right time<br/>
					for explaining that speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, Prince, that the Tathāgata has compassion for creatures."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, if those who are learned nobles<br/>
					and learned brahmans<br/>
					and learned householders<br/>
					and learned recluses<br/>
					approach the Tathāgata<br/>
					and ask him a question they have constructed -<br/>
					has the Lord already reflected in his mind on this,<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whoever, having approached me,<br/>
					questions me like this,<br/>
					then, asked thus,<br/>
					I will answer them thus,<br/>
					or does (the answer) occur to a Tathāgata immediately?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Prince,<br/>
					I will ask you a question in return.</p>

					<p class="f4">As it may please you,<br/>
					so may you answer it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,<br/>
					I am skilled in the various parts of a chariot."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">If those who have approached you<br/>
					should ask thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is the name<br/>
					of this particular part of the chariot?'</p>

					<p class="f4">would you have already <span class="f2">[396]</span> reflected on this in your mind,<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If those who have approached me<br/>
					should ask thus,<br/>
					then I will answer them thus,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or would (the answer) occur to you immediately?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Because, revered sir,<br/>
					I am a renowned charioteer,<br/>
					skilled in the various parts of a chariot,<br/>
					all the particular parts of a chariot<br/>
					are fully known to me,<br/>
					so (the answer) would occur to me immediately."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Prince,<br/>
					if those who are learned nobles<br/>
					and learned brahmans<br/>
					and learned householders<br/>
					and learned recluses<br/>
					approach the Tathāgata<br/>
					and ask him a question they have constructed,<br/>
					(the answer) occurs to the Tathāgata immediately.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason <span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span> for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, Prince, that the constitution of dhamma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/>
					is fully penetrated by the Tathāgata,<br/>
					and because of his full penetration<br/>
					of the constitution of dhamma<br/>
					(the answer) occurs to the Tathāgata immediately."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					Prince Abhaya spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent, revered sir,<br/>
					it is excellent, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, one might set upright what had been upset,<br/>
					or might disclose what was covered,<br/>
					or point out the way<br/>
					to one who had gone astray,<br/>
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br/>
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br/>
					even so is <i>dhamma</i> made clear<br/>
					in many a figure by the the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am going to the Lord for refuge,<br/>
					and to <i>dhamma</i><br/>
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Lord accept me<br/>
					as a lay-follower,<br/>
					one gone for refuge from today forth<br/>
					for as long as life lasts."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>cf.</i> <i>S.</i> iv. 323.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>āpāyika,</i> a man in "Misery." These and the following three expressions are also found at <i>Vin.</i> ii. 202, <i>It.</i> p. 85, <i>A.</i> iii. 402, iv. 160, etc. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Vin. Texts</i> iii. 262, <i>n.</i> 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>kappaṭṭha,</i> endures for an eon in these states (Misery and Hell), incapable of winning out of them to happier births during this eon, <i>kappa.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>atekiccha.</i> Mrs. Rhys Davids, <i>G.S.</i> iii. p. xiv refers to <i>atekiccha</i> as having "the fearful implication, possibly monkish, of a Buddhist hell that is unending," or, as <i>MA.</i> iii. 108 says, <b>buddhasahassena,</b> while a thousand Buddhas come and go. Certainly the Hell, for Devadatta, endures as long as the <i>kalpa,</i> but the <i>kalpa,</i> as in Hindu philosophy, is regarded as subject to "involution," absorption, rest, before it evolves or manifests again - and endlessly again. Only the major, almost symbolical events are repeated in each <i>kalpa;</i> the details vary, so after this <i>kalpa</i> Devadatta is no longer doomed to states of misery and Hell.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Miln.</i>. 108, 162; <i>K.S.</i> iv. 229, n., "the horns of a dilemma."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> <i>ekaṁsena.</i> No doubt referring to the two-edged question the Jains planned to ask Gotama so as to trip him up. <i>Cf.</i> <i>ekaṁsavādo</i> at <i>M.</i> ii. 197.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> <i>anassuṁ,</i> are frustrated. <i>MA.</i> iii. 109 says <i>naṭṭhā,</i> lost, destroyed, perished. The meaning is that in view of this counter-question of Gotama's, the Jains are already defeated as the further questions they had devised would now be meaningless.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> iii. 6. For the opening phrase, <i>cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i. 324, ii. 24.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> <i>ṭhanaso,</i> both on the spot <i>(ṭhānuppattika)</i> and at that moment <i>(tath khaṇaṁ).</i> It means "without an interval or a cause (of change), at once, immediately, spontaneously, impromptu." <i>P.E.D.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> The word <i>dhammadhātu,</i> as the ultimate principle or own-nature, own-being, self-nature, of <i>dhamma</i> occurs also at <i>D.</i> ii. 8. It is explained at <i>MA.</i> iii. 113 as <i>dhammasabhāva.</i> At <i>S.</i> ii. 143, <i>Netti.</i> 64, <i>Vism.</i> 486 it would seem to be used in the sense of mental state considered as an irreducible element, <i>cf.</i> <i>Dhs.</i> 67, 69, <i>Vbh.</i> 87, 89. For a more detailed discussion of the Buddha's "power of immediate response," see A.K. Coomaraswamy, Some Pali Words, <i>H.J.A.S.</i>, vol. IV, No. 2, July 1939, p. 188.</p>
