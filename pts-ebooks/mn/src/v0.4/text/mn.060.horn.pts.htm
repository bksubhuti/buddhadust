					<p><span class="f2">[400]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4"> At one time the Lord, walking on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Order of monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> arrived at the Brahman village of the Kosalans named Sālā. The Brahman householders of Sālā heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is said that the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans, gone forth from the Sakyan family, and walking on tour among the Kosalans <span class="f2">[401]</span> together with a large Order of monks, has reached Sālā, and that a lovely reputation has gone forth about the Lord Gotama thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is perfected, wholly Self-awakened, endowed with (right) knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of the worlds, incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of devas and men, the Awakened One, the Lord. He makes known this world with the <i>devas,</i> with Māra, with Brahmā, creation with its recluses and Brahmans, its <i>devas</i> and men, having realised them by his own super-knowledge. He teaches <i>dhamma</i> that is lovely at the <span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span> beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the ending, with the spirit and the letter; he proclaims the Brahmā-faring wholly fulfilled, quite purified. It were good to see perfected ones like this.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brahman householders of Sālā approached the Lord; some, having approached, having greeted the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance; some exchanged greetings with the Lord and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way, sat down at a respectful distance; some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms, sat down at a respectful distance; some, having made known their names and clans in the Lord's presence, sat down at a respectful distance; some, becoming silent, sat down at a respectful distance. As they were sitting down at a respectful distance, the Lord spoke thus to the Brahman householders of Sālā:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you, householders, some satisfactory teacher in whom your faith is grounded?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"We have no satisfactory teacher, revered sir, in whom our faith is grounded."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If you, householders, have no satisfactory teacher, then taking up this sure<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> <i>dhamma</i> you should practise it. For, householders, sure is <i>dhamma</i>; rightly undertaken, it will long be for your welfare and happiness. And what, householders, is this sure <i>dhamma?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There are, householders, some recluses and Brahmans who speak thus and are of these views<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span>:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no (result of) gift, there is no (result of) offering, no (result of) sacrifice; there is no fruit or ripening of deeds well done or ill done; there is not this world, there is not a world beyond; there is no (benefit from serving) mother or father; there are no spontaneously arising beings; there are not in the world recluses and Brahmans who are faring rightly, proceeding rightly, and who proclaim this world and a world beyond, having realised them by their own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, householders, there are <span class="f2">[402]</span> some recluses and Brahmans who speak in direct opposition to these recluses and Brahmans, and who say this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is (result of) gift, there is (result of) offering, there is (result of) sacrifice; there is fruit and ripening of deeds well done and ill done; there is this world, there is a world beyond; there is (benefit from serving) mother and father; there are spontaneously uprising beings; there are in the world recluses and Brahmans who are faring rightly, proceeding rightly, and who proclaim this world and a world beyond, <span class="f2 g"><b>[71]</b></span> having realised them by their own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, householders?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not these recluses and Brahmans speak in direct opposition to one another?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span>
					"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, householders, of those recluses and Brahmans who speak thus and are of these views: 'There is no (result of) gift ... having realised them by their own super-knowledge,' this is to be expected for them:</p>

					<p class="f4">Having laid aside these three good things: right conduct of body, right conduct of speech, right conduct of thought, and taking up these three bad things: wrong conduct of body, wrong conduct of speech, wrong conduct of thought, they practise them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this? It is that these worthy recluses and Brahmans do not see the peril in wrong things, the vanity, the defilement, nor the advantage, allied to purity, of renouncing them for the good things.</p>

					<p class="f4">And because there is indeed a world beyond, the view of anyone that there is not a world beyond is a false view of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond, if anyone has the conception that there is not a world beyond, it is a false conception of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond, if anyone utters the speech:<br/>
					'There is not a world beyond,'<br/>
					it is a false speech of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond, if anyone says that there is not a world beyond, he makes mock of those perfected ones who are knowers of a world beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond, if he convinces others that there is not a world beyond, that convincing of his is against true <i>dhamma</i>, and because of that convincing which is against true <i>dhamma</i>, he is exalting himself and disparaging others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, before his good morality is got rid of, bad morality is set up.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this false view, false conception, false speech, the mocking of the ariyans, the convincing which is against true <i>dhamma</i>, the exalting of oneself, the disparaging of others — these are a variety of evil, unskilled states that arise thus because of false view.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[403]</span> Hereupon,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> householders, an intelligent man reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If there is not a world beyond, this worthy individual at the breaking up of the body will make himself safe;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> but if there is a world beyond, this worthy individual at the breaking up of the body after dying, will arise in a sorrowful way, a bad bourn, the downfall, Niraya Hell. But if it be granted that there is not a world beyond, if this is a true speech of these recluses and Brahmans, <span class="f2 g"><b>[72]</b></span> then the worthy individual is condemned here and now by intelligent persons who say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of bad moral habit is the individual, of false view, he holds the theory of "There is not".'<span class="f3"><sup>7</sup></span> But if there is indeed a world beyond, thus is there defeat<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> in two ways for this worthy individual: inasmuch as he is condemned here and now by intelligent persons, and inasmuch as at the breaking up of the body after dying he will uprise in a sorrowful way, a bad bourn, the downfall, Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this sure <i>dhamma</i> has been undertaken imperfectly by him, he has applied himself one-sidedly,<span class="f3"><sup>9</sup></span> he is neglecting the skilled stance.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, householders, of those recluses and Brahmans who speak thus and are of these views:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is (result of) gift,... having realised them by their own super-knowledge,' this is to be expected of them:</p>

					<p class="f4">Having laid aside these three bad things:<br/>
					wrong conduct of body,<br/>
					wrong conduct of speech,<br/>
					wrong conduct of thought,<br/>
					and taking up these three good things:<br/>
					right conduct of body,<br/>
					right conduct of speech,<br/>
					right conduct of thought,<br/>
					they practise them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is that these worthy recluses and Brahmans see the peril, the vanity, the defilement in wrong things, and the advantage, allied to purity, of renouncing them for states that are good.</p>

					<p class="f4">And because there is indeed a world beyond,<br/>
					the view of anyone that there is a world beyond is a right view of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond, if anyone has the conception<span class="f3"><sup>11</sup></span> that there is a world beyond it is a right conception<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond, if anyone utters the speech:<br/>
					'There is a world beyond,'<br/>
					it is a right speech of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond, if anyone says that there is a world beyond, he does not make mock of those perfected ones who are knowers of the world beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond, if he convinces others that there is a world beyond, <span class="f2">[404]</span> that convincing of his is according to true <i>dhamma</i>, and because of this convincing which is in accordance with true <i>dhamma</i>, he does not exalt just himself, he does not disparage others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, before his bad morality is got rid of, good morality is set up.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this right view,<br/>
					right conception,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					this non-mocking of the ariyans,<br/>
					the convincing which is in accordance with true <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					the non-exalting of self,<br/>
					the non-disparaging of others —<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[73]</b></span> these are a variety of good states that arise because of right view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, householders, an intelligent man reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If there is a world beyond,<br/>
					this worthy individual at the breaking up of the body after dying will arise in a good bourn, a heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if it be granted that there is not a world beyond,<br/>
					if this is a true speech of these recluses and Brahmans,<br/>
					then this worthy individual is praised here and now by intelligent persons who say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of good moral habit is the individual, of right view, he holds the theory of "There is."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But if there is indeed a world beyond,<br/>
					thus is there victory<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> in two ways for this worthy individual:<br/>
					inasmuch as he is praised here and now by intelligent persons,<br/>
					and inasmuch as at the breaking up of the body after dying he will uprise in a good bourn,<br/>
					a heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this sure <i>dhamma</i> has been undertaken perfectly by him,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And because there is indeed cause,<br/>
					the view of anyone that there is not cause is a <span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span> false view of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed cause,<br/>
					if anyone has the conception that there is not cause<br/>
					it is a false conception of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed cause,<br/>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed cause,<br/>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed cause,<br/>
					if he convinces others that there is not cause,<br/>
					this convincing of his is against true <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					and because of this convincing which is against true <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					he is exalting himself and disparaging others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, before his good morality is got rid of,<br/>
					bad morality is set up.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this false view,<br/>

					these are a variety of evil,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, householders,<br/>

					this worthy individual at the breaking up of the body after dying<br/>

					<p class="f4">But if it be granted that there is not cause,<br/>

					"Of bad moral habit is the individual,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But if there is indeed cause,<br/>

					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">This sure <i>dhamma</i> has thus been imperfectly undertaken by him,<br/>
					he has applied himself one-sidedly,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, householders,<br/>
					those recluses and Brahmans who speak thus and are of these views:<br/>
					'There is cause, there is reason ...<br/>

					this is to be expected for them:<br/>
					Having laid aside these three bad things:<br/>

					and taking up these three good things:<br/>
					right conduct of body,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And because there is indeed cause,<br/>

					if anyone says that there is cause,<br/>
					he does not make mock of those perfected ones who hold the theory of cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed cause,<br/>
					if he convinces others that there is cause,<br/>
					this convincing of his is in accordance with true <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					and because of this convincing which is in accordance with true <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					he does not exalt himself,<br/>
					does not disparage others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, before his bad morality is got rid of,<br/>
					good morality is set up.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this right view,<br/>

					the non-mocking of the ariyans,<br/>

					the nonexalting of self,<br/>
					the non-disparaging of others —<br/>
					these are a variety of good states<br/>
					that arise because of right view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, householders, an intelligent man reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If there is indeed cause,<br/>
					this worthy individual at the breaking up of the body after dying<br/>

					a heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if it be granted that there is not cause,<br/>
					if this is a true speech of these worthy recluses and Brahmans,<br/>
					then this worthy individual is praised here and now by intelligent persons who say:<br/>
					'Of good moral habit is the individual,<br/>

					he professes that there is cause.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is indeed <span class="f2">[410]</span> cause,<br/>
					thus is there victory in two ways for this worthy individual:<br/>
					inasmuch as he is praised here and now by intelligent persons,<br/>
					and inasmuch as on the breaking up of the body after dying<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a></sup> <i>MA.</i> iii. 123 says that <i>bhavanirodha</i> (the stopping of becoming or becomings) is nibbāna, as does <i>S.</i> ii. 117, <i>A.</i> v. 9. I take <i>bhava,</i> in <i>bhava-nirodha,</i> as a plural to fit the plural <i>bhavānaṁ</i> at the end of this clause, see p. 81 below. Reference is no doubt intended to the three becomings, <i>kāma-bhava, rūpa- and arūpa-bhava.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a></sup> As in the <i>Kandaraka Sutta,</i> <i>M.</i> Sta. No. 51. <i>MA.</i> iii. 124 says that the five types of persons who hold the views: There is not, there is no efficient action, there is no cause, there is not formlessness, there is not stopping — become as it were three persons here; and the five who hold the opposite views of There is, etc., become as it were one person, namely the fourth kind. It must therefore be supposed that Bu. thought of the first group as comprising tormentors of self, of others and of both. The second "group "held the right views and are non-tormentors.</p>
