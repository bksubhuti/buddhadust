					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove<br/>
					at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the venerable Rāhula<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> was staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>
					emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br/>
					approached Ambalaṭṭhikā.<br/>
					and the venerable Rāhula.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Rāhula saw the Lord coming in the distance;<br/>
					seeing him,<br/>
					he made ready a seat<br/>
					and water for (washing) the feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord sat down on the seat made ready;<br/>
					as he was sitting down<br/>
					he bathed his feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Rāhula,<br/>
					having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>
					having put a little quantity of water<br/>
					that was left over<br/>
					into a water-vessel,<br/>
					addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula,<br/>
					see this little quantity of water<br/>
					that is left over<br/>
					and that is put into the water-vessel?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/>
					little is the recluseship<br/>
					of those who have no shame at intentional lying."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>
					having thrown away that little quantity of water,<br/>
					addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula,<br/>
					see this little quantity of water<br/>
					that has been thrown away?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/>
					thrown away is the recluseship<br/>
					of those who have no shame at intentional lying."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>
					having overturned that water-vessel,<br/>
					addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span> saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula, see this water-vessel<br/>
					that has been overturned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/>
					overturned is the recluseship<br/>
					of those who have no shame at intentional lying."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>
					having turned upright that water-vessel,<br/>
					addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula,<br/>
					see this water-vessel that is empty,<br/>
					void?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/>
					void and empty is the recluseship<br/>
					of those who have no shame at intentional lying.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rāhula, it is like<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> a king's bull-elephant<br/>
