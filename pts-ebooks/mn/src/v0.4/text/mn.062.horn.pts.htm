					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Rāhula, <span class="f2">[421]</span> having also dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe followed close after the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having looked round, addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever, Rāhula, is material shape, past, future, present, subjective or objective, gross or subtle, low or excellent, distant or near,<br/>
					all material shape should be seen as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom thus:<br/>
					'This is not mine,<br/>
					this am I not,<br/>
					this is not my self.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Only material shape, Lord,<br/>
					only material shape, Wellfarer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Material shape, Rāhula,<br/>
					and feeling, Rāhula,<br/>
					and perception, Rāhula,<br/>
					and the habitual tendencies, Rāhula,<br/>
					and consciousness, Rāhula."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Rāhula thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who indeed today, when he has been exhorted with an exhortation face-to-face with the Lord, could enter a village for almsfood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And turning back from there,<br/>
					he sat down cross-legged at the root of a tree,<br/>
					holding his back erect<br/>
					and arousing mindfulness in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta saw the venerable Rāhula sitting down cross-legged at the root of the tree, holding his back erect and arousing mindfulness in front of him;<br/>
					and seeing him, he addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Develop the (mind-) development<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> that is mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula,<br/>
					if developed and made much of<br/>
					is of great fruit, of great advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable <span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span> Rāhula, emerging from solitary meditation towards evening, approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached, having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					he sat down at a respectful distance.<br/>
					As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>
					the venerable Rāhula spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, how if mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing is developed and made much of is it of great fruit, of great advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Rāhula, is hard, solid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom, that is to say:<br/>
					the hair of the head, the hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow of the bones, kidney, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, excrement,<br/>
					or whatever other thing is hard, solid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,<br/>
					this, Rāhula, is called the internal element of extension.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is an internal element of extension<br/>
					and whatever is an external element of extension,<br/>
					just these are the element of extension.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:<br/>
					This is not mine,<br/>
					this am I not,<br/>
					this is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[422]</span> Having seen it thus as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,<br/>
					he disregards the element of extension,<br/>
					he cleanses his thought of the element of extension.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Rāhula, is the liquid element?</p>

					<p class="f4">The liquid element may be internal, it may be external.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Rāhula, is the internal liquid element?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is liquid, fluid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom, that is to say:<br/>
					bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, serum, saliva, mucus, synovial fluid, urine<br/>
					or whatever other thing is liquid, fluid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,<br/>
					this, Rāhula, is called the internal liquid element.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is an internal liquid element and whatever is an external liquid element, just these are the liquid element.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:<br/>
					This is not mine,<br/>
					this am I not,<br/>
					this is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen this thus as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,<br/>
					he disregards the liquid element,<br/>
					he cleanses his thought of the liquid element.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Rāhula, is the element of heat?</p>

					<p class="f4">The heat element may be internal, it may be external.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Rāhula, is the [<span class="f3"><i>93</i></span>] internal heat element?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is heat, warmth, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,<br/>
					such as by whatever one is vitalised, by whatever one is consumed, by whatever one is burnt up, and by whatever one has munched, drunk, eaten and tasted that is properly transformed (in digestion),<br/>
					or whatever other thing is heat, warmth, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,<br/>
					this, Rāhula, is called the internal heat element.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is an internal element of heat and whatever is an external element of heat,<br/>
					just these are the element of heat.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:<br/>
					This is not mine,<br/>
					this am I not,<br/>
					this is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen this thus as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,<br/>
					he disregards the heat element,<br/>
					he cleanses his thought of the heat	element.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Rāhula, is the element of motion?</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of motion may be internal, it may be external.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Rāhula, is the internal element of motion?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is motion, wind, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,<br/>
					such as winds going upwards, winds going downwards, winds in the abdomen, winds in the belly, winds that shoot across the several limbs, in-breathing, out-breathing,<br/>
					or whatever other thing is motion, wind, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,<br/>
					this, Rāhula, is called the internal element of motion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is an internal element of motion and whatever is an external element of motion, just these are the element of motion.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:<br/>
					This is not mine,<br/>
					this am I not,<br/>
					this is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen this thus as it really is <span class="f2">[423]</span> by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,<br/>
					he disregards the element of motion,<br/>
					he cleanses his thought of the element of motion.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Rahlda, is the element of space?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The element of space may be internal, it may be external.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Rāhula, is the internal element of space?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is space, spacious, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom,<br/>
					such as the auditory and nasal orifices, the door of the mouth and that by which one swallows what is munched, drunk, eaten and tasted, and where this remains, and where it passes out of (the body) lower down,<br/>
					or whatever other thing is space, spacious, is internal, referable to an <span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span> individual and derived therefrom,<br/>
					this, Rāhula, is called the internal element of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is an internal element of space and whatever is an external element of space, just these are the element of space.</p>
