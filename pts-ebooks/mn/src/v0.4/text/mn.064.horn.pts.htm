					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you, monks, remember<br/>
					that I taught you about the five fetters<br/>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					the venerable Māluṅkyāputta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, I, revered sir, remember<br/>
					that the Lord taught that there are five fetters<br/>
					binding to the lower (shore)."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But do you, Māluṅkyāputta, remember it<br/>
					as it was spoken by me<br/>
					when I taught you about the five fetters<br/>
					binding to the lower (shore)?"</p>

					is a fetter binding to the lower (shore).</p>

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, remember<br/>

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, remember<br/>
					that clinging to rites and customs<br/>

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, remember<br/>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that I, revered sir, remember<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda, listen,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>

But I think <i>na vimuccati</i> (and <i>vimuccati</i> a little lower) are certainly right here, for to cross over is to be freed. Moreover at <i>M.</i> i. 186 <i>adhimuccati</i> is part of the sequence of verbs all referring to the same subject, whereas above <i>na vimuccati</i> is not.
