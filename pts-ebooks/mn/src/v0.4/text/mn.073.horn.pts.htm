					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br/>
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>
					the wanderer Vacchagotta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a long time since I had a conversation with the good Gotama.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It were good if the revered Gotama were to teach me in brief what is skilled and what is unskilled."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, Vaccha, could teach you what is skilled and what is unskilled <span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span> in brief;<br/>
					and I, Vaccha, could teach you what is skilled and what is unskilled in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I, Vaccha, will teach you what is skilled and what is unskilled in brief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to it,<br/>
					attend carefully,<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir,"the wanderer Vacchagotta answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Greed, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					absence of greed is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aversion, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					absence of aversion is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Confusion, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					absence of confusion is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three things that are unskilled, Vaccha,<br/>
					the three that are skilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Vaccha, onslaught on creatures<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is unskill,<br/>
					restraint from onslaught on creatures is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Taking what has not been given, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					restraint from taking what has not been given is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wrong conduct in regard to sense-pleasures, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					restraint from wrong conduct in regard to sense-pleasures is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lying speech, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					restraint from lying speech is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Slanderous speech, Vaccha, <span class="f2">[490]</span> is unskill,<br/>
					restraint from slanderous speech is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Harsh speech, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					restraint from harsh speech is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Frivolous chatter, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					restraint from frivolous chatter is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Covetousness, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					absence of covetousness is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Malevolence, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					absence of malevolence is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wrong view, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>
					right view is skill.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ten things that are unskilled, Vaccha,<br/>
					and the ten that are skilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving, Vaccha,<br/>
					has been got rid of by a monk,<br/>
					cut off at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump<br/>
					that can come to no further existence in the future,<br/>
					he is a monk who is a perfected one,<br/>
					canker-waned,<br/>
					who has lived the life,<br/>
					done what was to be done,<br/>
					laid down the burden,<br/>
					attained his own goal,<br/>
					the fetters of becoming quite destroyed,<br/>
					freed by right profound knowledge."</p>

					having realised here and now<br/>
					by his own super-knowledge<br/>
					the freedom of mind<br/>

					that are cankerless,<br/>
					entering on them is abiding in them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not merely a hundred, Vaccha,<br/>

					holding a wrong view,<br/>
					incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view -<br/>
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br/>
					have arisen in a sorrowful state,<br/>
					a bad bourn,<br/>
					the abyss,<br/>
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these worthy beings<br/>
					who were possessed of right conduct<br/>
					in body, speech and thought,<br/>
					who were not scoffers at the ariyans,<br/>
					holding a right view,<br/>
					incurring deeds consequent on a right view -<br/>
					these at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br/>
					have arisen in a good bourn,<br/>
					a heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the purified deva-vision<br/>
					surpassing that of men<br/>
					may I behold beings as they pass hence,<br/>
					as they come to be,<br/>
					may I comprehend that they are mean, excellent, comely, ugly,<br/>
					in a good bourn,<br/>
					in a bad bourn<br/>
					according to the consequences of deeds' -<br/>
					you will achieve what may be realised here and there,<br/>
					so long as there is the objective.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span> If you, Vaccha, should wish like this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'By the destruction of the cankers,<br/>
					having realised here and now<br/>
					by my own super-knowledge<br/>
					the freedom of mind<br/>
					and the freedom through intuitive wisdom<br/>
					that are cankerless,<br/>
					entering thereon,<br/>
					may I abide therein' -<br/>
					you will achieve what may be realised here and there,<br/>
					so long as there is the objective."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vacchagotta,<br/>
					having rejoiced in what the Lord had said,<br/>
					having given thanks,<br/>
					rising from his seat,<br/>
					having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vacchagotta,<br/>
					having soon realised here and now<br/>
					through his own super-knowledge<br/>
					that incomparable goal of the Brahma-faring<br/>
					for the sake of which young men of family<br/>
					rightly go forth from home into homelessness,<br/>
					entering on it,<br/>
					abided in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he understood:</p>

					<p class="f4">Destroyed is birth,<br/>
					brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br/>
					done is what was to be done,<br/>
					there is no more of being such or so.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Vacchagotta became one of the perfected ones.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a number of monks were going to see the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Vacchagotta saw these monks coming in the distance;<br/>
					having seen them,<br/>
					he approached these monks;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					he spoke thus to these monks:</p>

					<p class="f4"> <span class="f2">[497]</span> "But now, where are you venerable ones going?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"We are going to see the Lord, your reverence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, in my name<br/>
					let the venerable ones salute the Lord's feet with their heads, saying,<br/>
					'Revered sir, the monk Vacchagotta salutes the Lord's feet with his head,'<br/>
					and then say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is waited on<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> by me,<br/>
					the Well-farer is waited on by me.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence," these monks answered the venerable Vacchagotta in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these monks approached the lord;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance<br/>
					these monks spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, the venerable Vacchagotta salutes the Lord's feet with his head and speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is waited on by me,<br/>
					the Well-farer is waited on by me.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, by a reasoning of mind I already knew the mind of the monk Vacchagotta:<br/>
					of threefold knowledge is the monk Vacchagotta,<br/>
					of great psychic power,<br/>
					of great majesty.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <i>devatās</i> also <span class="f2 g"><b>[176]</b></span> told me this matter:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span>'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of threefold knowledge is the monk Vaeehagotta,<br/>
					revered sir, he is of great psychic power,<br/>
					of great majesty.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
