					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					on Mount Vulture Peak in the Boar's Cave.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Dīghanakha<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br/>
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>
					he stood at a respectful distance.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br/>
					the wanderer Dīghanakha spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, good Gotama, speak thus,<br/>
					I am of this view:<br/>
					All<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> is not pleasing to me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This view of yours, Aggivessana:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					All is not pleasing to me<br/>
					— does this view of yours not please you?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span> "If this view were pleasing to me, good Gotama,<br/>
					this would be like it too,<br/>
					that <span class="f2">[498]</span> would be like it too.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span>"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, Aggivessana, when those,<br/>
					the majority in the world, speak thus:<br/>
					'This would be like it too,<br/>
					that would be like it too'<br/>
					— they do not get rid of that very view,<br/>
					and they take up another view.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Aggivessana, when those,<br/>
					the minority in the world, speak thus:<br/>
					'This would be like it too,<br/>
					that would be like it too'<br/>
					— they get rid of that very view<br/>
					and do not take up another view.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, Aggivessana,<br/>
					some recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br/>
					and are of this view:<br/>
					'All is pleasing to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, Aggivessana,<br/>
					some recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br/>
					and are of this view:<br/>
					'All is not pleasing to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, Aggivessana,<br/>
					some recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br/>
					and are of this view:<br/>
					'Part is pleasing to me,<br/>
					part is not pleasing to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Aggivessana,<br/>
					those recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br/>
					and are of this view:<br/>
					'All is pleasing to me'<br/>
					— this view of theirs<br/>
					is close to<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> attachment,<br/>
					close to the fetters,<br/>
					close to delight,<br/>
					close to cleaving,<br/>
					close to grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Aggivessana,<br/>
					those recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br/>
					and are of this view:<br/>
					'All is not pleasing to me'<br/>
					— this view of theirs<br/>
					is close to detachment,<br/>
					close to the absence of fetters,<br/>
					close to the absence of delight,<br/>
					close to the absence of cleaving,<br/>
					close to the absence of grasping."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					the wanderer Dīghanakha spoke thus to the Lord:<br/>
					"The good Gotama is complimentary to my view,<br/>
					the good Gotama is very complimentary to my view."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, Aggivessana,<br/>
					those recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br/>
					and are of this view:<br/>
					'Part is pleasing to me,<br/>
					part is not pleasing to me'<br/>
					— that which in this view is pleasing to them<br/>
					is close to attachment,<br/>
					close to the fetters<br/>
					close to delight,<br/>
					close to cleaving,<br/>
					close to grasping.<br/>
					But that which in this view<br/>
					is not pleasing to them<br/>
					is close to detachment,<br/>
					close to the absence of fetters<br/>
					close to the absence of delight,<br/>
					close to the absence of cleaving,<br/>
					close to the absence of grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Concerning those recluses and brahmans, Aggivessana,<br/>
					who speak thus and are of this view:<br/>
					'All is pleasing to me,'<br/>
					if a learned man be there who reflects thus:<br/>
					'If I were to express this view of mine:<br/>
					"All is pleasing to me,"<br/>
					and, obstinately holding to it<br/>
					and adhering to it,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
					were to say:<br/>
					"This is indeed the truth,<br/>
					all else is falsehood"<br/>
					— there would be for me dispute with two (view-holders):<br/>
					both with whatever recluse or brahman speaks thus<br/>
					and is of this view:<br/>
					"All <span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span> is not pleasing to me,"<br/>
					and with whatever recluse or brahman speaks thus<br/>
					and <span class="f2">[499]</span> is of this view:<br/>
					"Part is pleasing to me,<br/>
					part is not pleasing to me"<br/>
					— there would be dispute for me with these two.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is dispute there is contention;<br/>
					if there is contention there is trouble;<br/>
					if there is trouble there is vexation.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So he, beholding this dispute and contention<br/>
					and trouble and vexation for himself,<br/>
					gets rid of that very view<br/>
					and does not take up another view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is the getting rid of these views,<br/>
					thus is the casting out of these views.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Aggivessana,<br/>
					those recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br/>

					"All is not pleasing to me,"<br/>

					there would be for me dispute with two (view-holders):<br/>

					<p class="f4">So he, beholding this dispute and contention<br/>

					and does not take up another view.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Aggivessana,<br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">[500]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span> But this body, Aggivessana,<br/>

					of a nature to be constantly rubbed away,<br/>
					pounded away,<br/>
					broken up and scattered,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>
					should be regarded as impermanent,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					as a disease,<br/>
					an imposthume,<br/>
					a dart,<br/>
					a misfortune,<br/>
					an affliction,<br/>

					as decay,<br/>
					empty,<br/>
					not-self.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When he regards this body<br/>
					as impermanent,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					as a disease,<br/>

					empty,<br/>
					not-self,<br/>
					whatever in regard to body<br/>
					is desire for body,<br/>
					affection for body,<br/>
					subordination to body,<br/>
					this is got rid of.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these three feelings, Aggivessana:<br/>
					pleasant feeling,<br/>
					painful feeling,<br/>
					feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time, Aggivessana,<br/>
					when one feels a pleasant feeling,<br/>
					at that time<br/>
					one feels neither a painful feeling<br/>
					nor does one feel a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time, Aggivessana,<br/>
					when one feels a painful feeling,<br/>
					at that time<br/>
					one feels neither a pleasant feeling<br/>
					nor does one feel a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time, Aggivessana,<br/>
					when one feels a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant,<br/>
					at that time<br/>
					one feels neither a pleasant feeling<br/>
					nor does one feel a painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasant feelings, Aggivessana,<br/>
					are impermanent,<br/>

					liable to decay,<br/>
					liable to fading away,<br/>
					liable to stopping.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing it thus, Aggivessana,<br/>
					an instructed disciple of the ariyans<br/>
					turns away from pleasant feelings<br/>
					and he turns away from painful feelings<br/>
					and he turns away from feelings that are neither painful nor pleasant;<br/>
					turning away he is dispassionate,<br/>
					being dispassionate he is freed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/>
					in freedom<br/>
					the knowledge comes to be that he is freed<br/>
					and he comprehends:<br/>
					'Destroyed is birth,<br/>
					brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br/>
					done is what was to be done,<br/>
					there is no more of being such or so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk whose mind is freed thus, Aggivessana,<br/>
					does not concur with <span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span> anyone,<br/>
					he does not dispute with anyone.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/>
					He makes use of the common phrases of the world<br/>
					without adhering to them."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta <span class="f2">[501]</span> was standing behind the Lord,<br/>
					fanning the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Sāriputta:<br/>
					"The Lord speaks to us<br/>
					of getting rid of these things and those<br/>
					by means of super-knowledge,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span><br/>
					the Well-farer speaks to us<br/>
					of casting out these things and those<br/>
					by means of super-knowledge."</p>

					<p class="f4">While the venerable Sāriputta was reflecting on this,<br/>
					his mind was freed from the cankers without clinging.<br/>
					But to the wanderer Dīghanakha<br/>
					there arose the stainless,<br/>
					spotless vision of <i>dhamma,</i><br/>
					that whatever is of the nature to arise<br/>
					all that is of the nature to stop.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Dīghanakha,<br/>
					having seen <i>dhamma,</i><br/>
					attained <i>dhamma,</i>,<br/>
					known <i>dhamma,</i><br/>
					plunged into <i>dhamma,</i><br/>
					having crossed over doubt,<br/>
					having put away uncertainty,<br/>
					attaining without another's help<br/>
					to full confidence in the Teacher's instruction,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span><br/>
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama,<br/>
					excellent, good Gotama.<br/>
					It is, good Gotama,<br/>
					as if one might set upright<br/>
					what had been upset,<br/>
					or might disclose<br/>
					what had been covered,<br/>
					or point out the Way<br/>
					to one who had gone astray,<br/>
					or might bring an oil-lamp<br/>
					into the darkness<br/>
					so that those with vision might see material shapes<br/>
					— even so in many a figure<br/>
					has <i>dhamma</i> been made clear by the good Gotama.<br/>
					I am going to the revered Gotarna for refuge<br/>
					and to <i>dhamma,</i><br/>
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the revered Gotama accept me<br/>
					as a layfollower going for refuge<br/>
					from today forth<br/>
					for as long as life lasts."</p>
