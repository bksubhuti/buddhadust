					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapinḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Vekhanassa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached, <span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span> he greeted the Lord;<br/>
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br/>
					the wanderer Vekhanassa uttered a solemn utterance<br/>
					in the Lord's presence:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the highest lustre,<br/>
					this is the highest lustre."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But why do you, Kaccāna,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the highest lustre,<br/>
					this is the highest lustre?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is this highest lustre?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, there is no other lustre<br/>
					superior to<br/>
					or more excellent than this lustre,<br/>
					it is the highest lustre."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But which, Kaccāna,<br/>
					is this lustre<br/>
					than which there is no other lustre<br/>
					superior or more excellent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, there is no other lustre<br/>
					superior to<br/>
					or more excellent than this lustre,<br/>
					it is the highest lustre."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You would be long in expanding this, Kaccāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">You say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good Gotama, there is no other lustre<br/>
					superior to<br/>
					or more excellent than this lustre,<br/>
					it is the highest lustre.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But you do not point to this lustre.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kaccāna, it is as though a man should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whoever is the belle of this countryside,<br/>
					I want her,<br/>
					I desire her.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Another man might say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good man,<br/>
					do you know whether this belle of the countryside<br/>
					whom you want and desire<br/>
					is a noble maiden<br/>
					or a brahmin<br/>
					or a merchant<br/>
					or a worker?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Asked this, he would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other might say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good man,<br/>
					do you know the name<br/>
					or the clan<br/>
					of this belle of the countryside<br/>
					whom you want and desire?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Asked this, he would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other might say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good man,<br/>
					do you know whether she is tall<br/>
					or short<br/>
					or of medium height,<br/>
					or dark<br/>
					or brown<br/>
					or sallow;<br/>
					or what village<br/>
					or market town<br/>
					or what town<br/>
					she belongs to?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Asked this, he might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other might speak to him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good man,<br/>
					do you want and desire<br/>
					her whom you know not,<br/>
					see not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Asked this, he might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">This being so,<br/>
					surely that man's irresponsible talk<br/>
					does not prosper him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Certainly, revered sir,<br/>
					this being so,<br/>
					that man's irresponsible talk<br/>
					does not prosper him."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But even so do you, Kaccāna, say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, there is no other lustre<br/>
					superior to<br/>
					or more excellent than this lustre,<br/>
					it is the highest lustre.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But you do not point to this lustre."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, as an emerald jewel,<br/>
					of lovely water,<br/>
					well cut into eight facets,<br/>
					if placed on a pale piece of cloth<br/>
					shines and gleams and glows -<br/>
					of such a lustre<br/>
					is the hale self<br/>
					after dying."</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>
					which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>
					that emerald jewel,<br/>
					of lovely water,<br/>
					cut into eight facets<br/>
					that, if placed on a pale piece of cloth<br/>
					shines and gleams and glows;<br/>
					or some glow-worm<br/>
					or fire-fly<br/>
					in the dense darkness of the night?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, revered sir, of these two lustres,<br/>
					the surpassing and more excellent<br/>
					is the glow-worm<br/>
					or fire-fly<br/>
					in the dense darkness of the night."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>
					which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>
					the glow-worm<br/>
					or fire-fly<br/>
					in the dense darkness of the night<br/>
					or an oil-lamp<br/>
					in the dense darkness of the night?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, revered sir, the oil-lamp."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>
					which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>
					the oil-lamp<br/>
					in the dense darkness of the night<br/>
					or a great blaze of fire<br/>
					in the dense darkness of the night?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, revered sir,<br/>
					the great blaze of fire<br/>
					in the dense darkness of the night."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>
					which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>
					the great blaze of fire<br/>
					in the dense darkness of the night<br/>
					or the morning star<br/>
					in a clear cloudless sky<br/>
					towards dawn?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, revered sir,<br/>
					the morning star<br/>
					in a clear cloudless sky<br/>
					towards dawn<br/>
					is the surpassing and more excellent<br/>
					of these two lustres."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>
					which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>
					the morning star<br/>
					in a clear cloudless sky<br/>
					towards dawn<br/>
					or the moon at its zenith<br/>
					in a clear cloudless sky<br/>
					at midnight<br/>
					on an Observance day,<br/>
					a fifteenth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, revered sir,<br/>
					on an Observance day,<br/>
					a fifteenth,<br/>
					the moon at its zenith<br/>
					in a clear cloudless sky<br/>
					at midnight."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>
					which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>
					the moon at its zenith<br/>
					in a clear cloudless sky<br/>
					at midnight<br/>
					on an Observance day,<br/>
					a fifteenth,<br/>
					or the sun at its zenith<br/>
					in a clear cloudless sky<br/>
					at noonday<br/>
					in the last month of the rains<br/>
					in the autumn?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, revered sir,<br/>
					the sun at its zenith<br/>
					in a clear cloudless sky<br/>
					at noonday<br/>
					in the last month of the rains<br/>
					in the autumn<br/>
					is of these two lustres<br/>
					the surpassing and more excellent."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Greater than these<br/>
					are those many devas, Kaccāna,<br/>
					who do not share in the brilliance<br/>
					of these moons and suns -<br/>
					that I comprehend.</p>

					<p class="f4">But then I do not say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no other lustre<br/>
					superior to<br/>
					or more excellent than this lustre.'</p>

						

					<p class="f4">But you, Kaccāna,<br/>
					although this lustre of a glow-worm<br/>
					or a fire-fly<br/>
					is feebler and poorer,<br/>
					say it is the highest lustre.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you do not point to that lustre.</p>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">These five, Kaccāna,<br/>
					are the strands of sense-pleasures.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Material shapes cognisable by the eye,<br/>
					agreeable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					liked,<br/>
					enticing,<br/>
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br/>
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognisable by the ear,<br/>
					agreeable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					liked,<br/>
					enticing,<br/>
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br/>
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Smells cognisable by the nose,<br/>
					agreeable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					liked,<br/>
					enticing,<br/>
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br/>
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tastes cognisable by the tongue,<br/>
					agreeable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					liked,<br/>
					enticing,<br/>
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br/>
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touches cognisable by the body,<br/>
					agreeable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					liked,<br/>
					enticing,<br/>
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br/>
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Kaccana, are the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever happiness, Kaccāna,<br/>
					whatever pleasure<br/>
					arises in consequence<br/>
					of these five strands of sense-pleasure,<br/>
					this is called happiness in sense-pleasures.</p>

						

					<p class="f4">Thus, because of sense-pleasures<br/>
					there is happiness in sense-pleasures;<br/>
					from happiness in sense-pleasures<br/>
					the topmost happiness in sense-pleasures<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					is there accounted topmost."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					the wanderer Vekhanassa spoke thus to <span class="f2 g"><b>[238]</b></span> the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, good Gotama,<br/>
					it is marvellous, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">So far this is well spoken by the good Gotama:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Because of sense-pleasures<br/>
					there is happiness in sense-pleasures;<br/>
					from happiness in sense-pleasures<br/>
					the topmost happiness in sense-pleasures<br/>
					is there accounted topmost.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hard is this for you to understand, Kaccāna -<br/>
					sense-pleasures,<br/>
					or the happiness in sense-pleasures,<br/>
					or the topmost happiness in sense-pleasures -<br/>
					you who are of another view,<br/>
					another allegiance,<br/>
					another objective,<br/>
					of a different observance<br/>
					and under a different teacher.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But those monks, Kaccāna, who are perfected ones,<br/>
					the cankers destroyed,<br/>
					who have lived the life,<br/>
					done what was to be done,<br/>
					shed the burden,<br/>
					who have attained their own goal,<br/>
					the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed,<br/>
					and who are freed<br/>
					by perfect profound knowledge -<br/>
					these would know:<br/>
					sense-pleasures,<br/>
					or the happiness in sense-pleasures,<br/>
					or the topmost happiness in sense-pleasures."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					the wanderer Vekhanassa,<br/>
					angry and displeased,<br/>
					scorning even the Lord,<br/>
					despising even him,<br/>
					saying<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> even of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama shall be disgraced,"</p>

					<p class="f4">spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But it is just that there are here<br/>
					some recluses and brahmans<br/>
					who, not knowing the past,<br/>
					not seeing the future,<br/>
					yet claim:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br/>
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br/>
					done is what was to be done,<br/>
					there is no more of being such or so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This speech of theirs<br/>
					proves merely ridiculous,<br/>
					worthless,<br/>
					empty,<br/>
					void."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"This censure is only just, Kaccāna,<br/>
					for those recluses and brahmans<br/>
					who, not knowing the past,<br/>
					not seeing the future,<br/>
					yet claim:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br/>
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br/>
					done is what was to be done,<br/>
					there is no more of being such or so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Kaccāna,<br/>
					let be the past,<br/>
					let be the future.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Let there come an intelligent man,<br/>
					guileless,<br/>
					honest,<br/>
					straight,<br/>
					and who says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I instruct,<br/>
					I teach <i>dhamma.</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Faring along as instructed<br/>
					it will not be long before (some man)<br/>
					of himself will know,<br/>
					of himself will see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, indeed,<br/>
					is deliverance from the direst bond -<br/>
					that is from the bond of ignorance.</p>

						

					<p class="f4">Kaccāna, it is like a young baby boy<br/>
					lying on his <span class="f2 g"><b>[239]</b></span> back<br/>
					and bound around his neck<br/>
					with a fivefold swaddling,<br/>
					it might be with swaddlings of thread.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he grows up<br/>
					and develops his faculties<br/>
					he would be released from those swaddlings,<br/>
					and in the absence of swaddlings<br/>
					he would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am released.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Kaccāna,<br/>
					let there come intelligent man,<br/>
					guileless,<br/>
					honest,<br/>
					straight,<br/>
					and who says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I instruct, I teach <i>dhamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Faring along as instructed<br/>
					it will not be long before (some man)<br/>
					of himself will know,<br/>
					of himself will see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, indeed,<br/>
					is deliverance from the direst bond -<br/>
					that is from the bond of ignorance."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					the wanderer Vekhanassa spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama,<br/>
					excellent, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, it is as if one might set upright<br/>
					what had been upset,<br/>
					or might disclose what was covered,<br/>
					or show the way<br/>
					to one who had gone astray,<br/>
					or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br/>
					so that those with vision<br/>
					might see material shapes —<br/>
					even so in many a figure<br/>
					has <i>dhamma</i> been made clear by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, am going to the Lord for refuge<br/>
					and to <i>dhamma</i><br/>
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Lord accept me as a lay follower<br/>
					going for refuge<br/>
					from this day forth<br/>
					for as long as life lasts."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>MA.</i> iii. 277 says he was the teacher of Sakuludāyin (of Stas. 77 and 79).

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Kaccāna (or Kaccāyana) was the name of a gotta, a family or clan. Presumably therefore Vekhanassa belonged to this clan.</p>
