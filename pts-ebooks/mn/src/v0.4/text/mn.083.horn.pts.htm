					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Mithilā<br/>
					in Makhādeva's Mango Grove.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord smiled (when he <span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span> came to a) certain place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the cause,<br/>
					what the reason<br/>
					that the Lord is smiling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not without motive<br/>
					do Tathāgatas smile."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					having arranged his robe over one shoulder,<br/>
					having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br/>
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, revered sir, what is the cause,<br/>
					what the reason<br/>
					that the Lord is smiling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not without motive<br/>
					do Tathāgatas smile."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, Ānanda,<br/>
					in this very Mithilā<br/>
					there was a king named Makhādeva,<br/>
					a <i>dhamma</i>-man,<br/>
					a king under <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					firm in <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					a great king who fared by <i>dhamma</i><br/>
					among brahmans and householders,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'When, good barber,<br/>

					then you may tell me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, the barber answered King Makhādeva in assent,<br/>
					saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sire.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br/>
					many hundreds of years,<br/>
					many thousands of years,<br/>
					the barber saw grey hairs growing<br/>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that, Ānanda,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Death's messengers<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> have appeared to his majesty;<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Well then, good barber,<br/>
					when you have pulled out those grey hairs properly with the tweezers,<br/>
					place them on my fingers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, your majesty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, Ānanda, the barber had answered King Makhādeva in assent,<br/>
					he pulled out the grey hairs properly with the tweezers<br/>
					and placed them on King Makhādeva's fingers.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda, King Makhādeva,<br/>
					having given the boon of a village to the barber,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed it is a gain for the Videhas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This chariot, sire,<br/>

					has been sent to you by Sakka, the lord of devas;<br/>
					sire, you should mount the deva-like vehicle without hesitation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, moreover, sire,<br/>
					by which (route) do I conduct you<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> -<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Conduct me by both, Mātali.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Ānanda, the charioteer Mātali<br/>

					and will observe the Observance<br/>
					on the fourteenth,<br/>
					fifteenth<br/>
					and eighth days of the half-month.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Sakka, the lord of devas,<br/>
					summoned the charioteer Mātali and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, good Mātali, having harnessed a chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds,<br/>
					take King Nimi back to Mithila itself.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[272]</b></span> 'So be it, your honour.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda, Mātali the charioteer,<br/>
					having answered Sakka, the lord of devas, in assent,<br/>
					harnessed a chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds<br/>
					and took King Nimi back to Mithilā itself.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there, Ānanda,<br/>
					King Nimi fared by <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					among brahmans and householders,<br/>
					townsfolk and countryfolk,<br/>
					and he observed the Observance<br/>
					on the fourteenth,<br/>
					fifteenth<br/>
					and eighth days<br/>
					of the half-month.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br/>
					many hundreds of years,<br/>
					many thousands of years,<br/>
					King Nimi addressed his barber,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, good barber,<br/>
					you see grey hairs growing on my head,<br/>
					then you may tell me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, the barber answered King Nimi in assent,<br/>
					saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sire.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br/>
					many hundreds of years,<br/>
					many thousands of years,<br/>
					the barber saw grey hairs growing<br/>
					on King Nimi's head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that, Ānanda,<br/>
					he spoke thus to King King Nimi:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Death's messengers have appeared to his majesty;<br/>
					grey hairs are to be seen growing on his head.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well then, good barber,<br/>
					when you have pulled out those grey hairs properly with the tweezers,<br/>
					place them on my fingers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, your majesty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, Ānanda, the barber had answered King Nimi in assent,<br/>
					he pulled out the grey hairs properly with the tweezers<br/>
					and placed them on King Nimi's fingers.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda, King Nimi,<br/>
					having given the boon of a village to the barber,<br/>
					had the prince who was his eldest son summoned<br/>
					and spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Dear Prince,<br/>
					Death's messengers have appeared to me;<br/>
					grey hairs are to be seen growing on my head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Human sense-pleasures have been enjoyed by me;<br/>
					it is now time to seek deva-like sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come you, dear Prince,<br/>
					rule this kingdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">For I, having cut off my hair and beard,<br/>
					having donned saffron garments,<br/>
					will go forth from home<br/>
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now, dear Prince,<br/>
					when you too see grey hairs growing on your head,<br/>
					then, having given the boon of a village to the barber,<br/>
					having handed over the kingdom properly<br/>
					to the prince who is your eldest son,<br/>
					having cut off your hair and beard,<br/>
					having donned saffron garments,<br/>
					you should go forth from home<br/>
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This lovely custom<br/>
					founded by me<br/>
					you should maintain;<br/>
					do not you be the last man after me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dear Prince, while two persons exist<br/>
					and there is a breaking of such a lovely custom,<br/>
					whichever of these (breaks it)<br/>
					he is the last man.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, dear Prince, speak thus to you:</p>

					<p class="f4">This lovely custom<br/>
					founded by me<br/>
					you should maintain;<br/>
					do not you be the last man after me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, King Nimi,<br/>
					having given the boon of the village to the barber,<br/>
					having handed over the kingdom properly<br/>
					to the prince who was his eldest son,<br/>
					having in this very Makhādeva Mango Grove<br/>
					cut off his hair and beard,<br/>
					having donned saffron garments,<br/>
					went forth from home<br/>
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of friendliness,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But, Ānanda, King Nimi<br/>
					had played at boys' sports<br/>
					for 84,000 years,<br/>
					had ruled as a viceroy<br/>
					for 84,000 years,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He, having developed the four Brahma-abidings,<br/>
					was one who at the breaking up of the body after dying<br/>
					reached the Brahma-world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Ānanda, King Nimi's son was called Kaḷārajanaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">He did not go forth from home<br/>

					<p class="f4">He broke that lovely custom;<br/>

					<p class="f4">It may be that this occurs to you, Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'At that time King Makhādeva<br/>

					was someone else.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But this, Ānanda, must not be understood thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, at that time, was King Makhādeva,<br/>
					I founded that lovely custom;<br/>

					maintained that lovely custom founded by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that lovely custom, Ānanda,<br/>
					did not conduce to turning away from,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And what, Ānanda,<br/>

					<p class="f4">It is this ariyan eightfold Way itself,<br/>

					<p class="f4">In regard to this, I, Ānanda,<br/>
