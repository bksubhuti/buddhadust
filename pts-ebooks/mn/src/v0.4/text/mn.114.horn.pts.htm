					<p class="f4">Thus I have heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you a  disquisition on <i>dhamma</i><br/>
					regarding what is to be followed<br/>
					and what is not to be followed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to it,<br/>
					pay careful attention<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,<br/>
					one of which is to be followed<br/>
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>
					and there is this disparity in bodily conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that vocal conduct is of two kinds,<br/>
					one of which is to be followed<br/>
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>
					and there is this disparity in vocal conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that mental conduct is of two kinds,<br/>
					one of which is to be followed<br/>
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>
					and there is this disparity in mental conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the arising of thought is of two kinds,<br/>
					one of which is to be followed<br/>
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>
					and there is this disparity in the arising of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the assumption of perception is of two kinds,<br/>
					one of which is to be followed<br/>
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>
					and there is this disparity in the assumption of perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the assumption of views is of two kinds,<br/>
					one of which is to be followed<br/>
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>
					and there is this disparity in the assumption of views.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the assumption of individuality<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> is of two kinds,<br/>
					one of which is to be <span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span> followed<br/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr"/>

					<p>&#160;</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir, thus understand this to be the meaning in full<br/>
					of what was spoken of by the Lord in brief,<br/>
					but of which the meaning was not explained in full:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,<br/>
					one of which is to be followed<br/>
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>
					and there is this disparity in bodily conduct.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This was said by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">In reference to what was it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of bodily conduct is followed<br/>
					and unskilled states of mind grow much,<br/>
					skilled states of mind decrease,<br/>
					this kind of bodily conduct is not to be followed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of bodily conduct is followed<br/>

					<p class="f4">As to this, revered sir,<br/>
					someone, abandoning onslaught on creatures,<br/>
					is restrained from onslaught on creatures;<br/>
					the stick laid aside,<br/>
					the sword laid aside,<br/>
					he lives scrupulous,<br/>
					merciful,<br/>
					kindly and compassionate<br/>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning taking what is not given,<br/>
					he is restrained from taking what is not given;<br/>
					he does not take by theft<br/>
					any property of another<br/>
					in village or jungle<br/>
					that is not given to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning wrong-going in <span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span> regard to pleasures of the senses,<br/>
					he is restrained from wrong-doing in regard to pleasures of the senses;<br/>
					he  does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by the mother,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If this kind of bodily conduct is followed, revered sir,<br/>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,<br/>
					one of which is to be followed<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">■</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, monks, say that vocal conduct is of two kinds,<br/>
					one of which is to be followed<br/>
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>
					and there is this disparity in vocal conduct.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This was said by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">In reference to what was it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of vocal conduct is followed<br/>
					and unskilled states of mind grow much,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of vocal conduct is followed<br/>

					<p class="f4">And what land of vocal conduct, revered sir,<br/>
					does a man follow<br/>
					that unskilled states of mind grow much in him,<br/>
					skilled states of mind decrease?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, revered sir,<br/>
					someone is of lying speech;<br/>
					when he is cited and questioned as a witness<br/>
					before a council or a company<br/>
					or amid his relations<br/>
					or amid a guild<br/>
					or a royal family,<br/>
					and is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, my good man,<br/>
					say what you know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">although he does not know, he says,<br/>
					'I know,'<br/>
					and although he knows, he says,<br/>
					'I do not know ;<br/>
					although he has not seen, he says,<br/>
					'I saw,'<br/>
					and although he has seen, he says,<br/>
					'I did not see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus his speech becomes intentional lying<br/>
					either for his own sake<br/>
					or for that of another<br/>
					or for the sake of some material gain or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is a slanderer;<br/>
					having heard something at one place,<br/>
					he makes it known elsewhere<br/>
					for causing variance among those people;<br/>
					or having heard something elsewhere<br/>
					he makes it known among these people<br/>
					for causing variance among them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he sows discord among those who were in harmony<br/>
					or foments those who are at variance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Discord is his pleasure,<br/>
					his delight,<br/>
					his joy,<br/>
					the motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is one of harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech is rough,<br/>
					hard,<br/>
					severe on others,<br/>
					abusive of others,<br/>
					bordering on wrath,<br/>
					not conducive to concentration,<br/>
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is a frivolous chatterer,<br/>
					one who speaks at a wrong time,<br/>
					not in accordance with fact,<br/>
					one who speaks about what is not the goal,<br/>
					about non-dhamma,<br/>
					about non-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters speech that is not <span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span> worth treasuring;<br/>
					owing to its being at the wrong time<br/>
					it is incongruous,<br/>
					has no purpose,<br/>
					is not connected with the goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this kind of vocal conduct is followed, revered sir,<br/>
					unskilled states of mind grow much,<br/>
					skilled states of mind decrease.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what kind of vocal conduct, revered sir,<br/>
					does a man follow<br/>
					that unskilled states of mind decrease in him,<br/>
					skilled states of mind grow much?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, revered sir, someone,<br/>
					abandoning lying speech<br/>
					is restrained from lying speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is cited and questioned as a witness<br/>
					before a council<br/>
					or company<br/>
					or amid his relations<br/>
					or amid a guild<br/>
					or a royal family,<br/>
					and is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, my good man,<br/>
					say what you know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">if he does not know he says,<br/>
					'I do not know,'<br/>
					and if he knows he says,<br/>
					'I know ;<br/>
					if he has not seen, he says,<br/>
					'I did not see,'<br/>
					and if he has seen, he says,<br/>
					'I saw.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus his speech is not intentional lying<br/>
					either for his own sake<br/>
					or for that of another<br/>
					or for the sake of some material gain or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech,<br/>
					he is restrained from slanderous speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard something at one place,<br/>
					he is not one to repeat it elsewhere<br/>
					for causing variance among those people;<br/>
					or having heard something elsewhere<br/>
					he is not one to repeat it among these people<br/>
					for causing variance among them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way<br/>
					he is a reconciler of those who are at variance<br/>
					and one who combines those who are friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Concord is his pleasure,<br/>
					his delight,<br/>
					his joy,<br/>
					the motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning harsh speech,<br/>
					he is restrained from harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech is gentle,<br/>
					pleasing to the ear,<br/>
					affectionate,<br/>
					going to the heart,<br/>
					urbane,<br/>
					pleasant to the manyfolk,<br/>
					agreeable to the manyfolk -<br/>
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning frivolous chatter,<br/>
					he is restrained from frivolous chatter.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one that speaks at a right time,<br/>
					in accordance with fact,<br/>
					about the goal,<br/>
					about <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>
					about discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters speech that is worth treasuring,<br/>
					with opportune similes,<br/>
					purposeful,<br/>
					connected with the goal.</p>
