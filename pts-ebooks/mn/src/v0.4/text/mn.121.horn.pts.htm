					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern monastery in the palace of Migara's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					emerging from solitary meditation towards evening, approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br/>
					he sat down at a respectful distance.<br/>
					As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"At one time, revered sir, the Lord was staying among the Sakyans.<br/>
					Nagaraka is the name of a market town of the Sakyans.<br/>
					And while I was there, revered sir,<br/>
					face-to-face with the Lord I heard,<br/>
					face-to-face I learnt:<br/>
					'I Ānanda,<br/>
					through abiding in (the concept of) emptiness,<br/>
					am now abiding in the fullness thereof.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					I hope that I heard this properly, revered sir,<br/>
					learnt it properly,<br/>
					attended to it properly<br/>
					and understood it properly?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Certainly, Ānanda,<br/>
					you heard this properly,<br/>
					learnt it properly,<br/>
					attended to it properly<br/>
					and understood it properly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Formerly I, Ānanda,<br/>
					as well as now,<br/>
					through abiding in (the concept of) emptiness,<br/>
					abide in the fullness thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">As this palace of Migara's mother<br/>
					is empty of elephants, cows, horses and mares,<br/>
					empty of gold and silver,<br/>
					empty of assemblages of men and women,<br/>
					and there is only this that is not emptiness,<br/>
					that is to say the solitude<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> grounded on the Order of monks;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					even so, Ānanda, a monk,<br/>
					not attending to the perception of village,<br/>
					not attending to the perception of human beings,<br/>
					attends to solitude grounded on the perception of forest.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					set on<br/>
					and freed in<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					the <span class="f3"><i>[148]</i></span> perception of forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends thus:<br/>
					'The disturbances there might be resulting from the perception of village do not exist here;<br/>
					the disturbances there might be resulting from the perception of human beings do not exist here.<br/>
					There is only this degree of disturbance,<br/>
					that is to say solitude grounded on the perception of forest.'</p>

					'This perceiving is empty of the perception of human beings.<br/>

					<span class="f3"><b>[105]</b></span> But in regard to what remains there he comprehends,<br/>
					'That being, this is.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, this comes to be for him a true,<br/>
					not a mistaken,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And again, Ānanda, a monk,<br/>
					not attending to the perception of human beings,<br/>

					attends to solitude grounded on the perception of earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, it is like a bull's hide well stretched on a hundred pegs, its virtue gone.<br/>
					Even so, Ānanda, a monk,<br/>
					not attending to anything on this earth:<br/>
					dry land and swamps,<span class="f3"><sup>8</sup></span> rivers and marshes,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> (plants) bearing stakes and thorns, hills and plains,<br/>
					attends to solitude grounded on the perception of earth.</p>
