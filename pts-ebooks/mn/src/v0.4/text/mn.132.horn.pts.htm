					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> H<span class="f2"><b>AVE</b></span> I H<span class="f2"><b>EARD</b></span>:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Ānanda gladdened,<br/>
					roused,<br/>
					incited<br/>
					and delighted the monks<br/>
					with talk on <i>dhamma</i><br/>
					in an assembly hall;<br/>
					and he spoke the exposition<br/>
					and the analysis<br/>
					of the Auspicious.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br/>
					approached that assembly hall;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					he sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down,<br/>
					the Lord addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, who, monks, gladdened,<br/>
					roused,<br/>
					incited,<br/>
					and delighted the monks<br/>
					with talk on <i>dhamma</i><br/>
					in the assembly hall?</p>

					<p class="f4">And did he speak the exposition<br/>
					and the analysis<br/>
					of the Auspicious?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The venerable Ānanda, revered sir,<br/>
					gladdened,<br/>
					roused,<br/>
					incited,<br/>
					and delighted the monks<br/>
					with talk on <i>dhamma</i><br/>
					in the assembly hall;<br/>
					and he spoke the exposition<br/>
					and the analysis<br/>
					of the Auspicious."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[236]</b></span> Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how is it that you, Ānanda,<br/>
					gladdened,<br/>
					roused,<br/>
					incited,<br/>
					and delighted the monks<br/>
					with talk on <i>dhamma</i>?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Did you speak the exposition<br/>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir, gladdened,<br/>
					roused,<br/>
					incited,<br/>
					and delighted the monks<br/>
					with talk on <i>dhamma</i> thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">I spoke the exposition<br/>
					and the analysis<br/>
					of the Auspicious:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The past should not be followed after, the future not desired.<br/>
							What is past is got rid of and the future has not come.<br/>
							But whoever has vision now here, now there, of a present thing,<br/>
							Knowing that it is immovable, unshakable, let him cultivate it.<br/>
							Swelter at the task this very day. Who knows whether he will die tomorrow?<br/>
							There is no bargaining with the great hosts of Death.<br/>
							Thus abiding ardently, unwearied day and night,<br/>
							He indeed is 'Auspicious' called, described as a sage at peace."</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does one follow after the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">He thinks: 'Such was my material shape in the distant past'<br/>
					and finds delight therein.<br/>
					He thinks: 'Such was my feeling in the distant past'<br/>
					and finds delight therein.<br/>
					He thinks: 'Such was my my perception in the distant past'<br/>
					and finds delight therein.<br/>
					He thinks: 'Such were my habitual tendencies in the distant past'<br/>
					and finds delight therein.<br/>
					He thinks: 'Such was my consciousness in the distant past'<br/>
					and finds delight therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks, does one follow after the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does one not follow after the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">He thinks: 'Such was my material shape in the distant past'<br/>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks, does one not follow after the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does one desire the future?</p>
