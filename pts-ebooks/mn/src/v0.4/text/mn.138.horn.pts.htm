					<p class="f4"><span class="f3 g"><i>[223]</i></span> THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, monks, an exposition and (its) analysis.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed.1</a></sup></span><br/>
					Listen to it,<br/>
					attend carefully,<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3 g"><i>[272]</i></span> "Monks, a monk should so investigate<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> (things) that,<br/>
					as he investigates,<br/>
					his consciousness of what is external<br/>
					be undistracted, not diffused,<br/>
					and of what is internal<br/>
					be unslackened<br/>
					so that it<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> may not be disturbed by grasping;<br/>

					then, for him who is (thus) undisturbed by grasping<br/>
					there is in the future<br/>
					no origin or rise<br/>
					of birth, old age and dying<br/>
					or of anguish."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had said this,<br/>
					the Well-farer rose from his seat and entered a dwelling-place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after the Lord had gone, it occurred to these monks:<br/>
					"Your reverences, the Lord, recited this exposition to us in brief:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk should so investigate (things) that,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But without having explained the meaning in full<br/>
					he rose from his seat and entered a dwelling-place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, who can explain the meaning in full<br/>
					of this exposition which was recited in brief by the Lord<br/>
					but the meaning of which he did not explain in full?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to these monks:<br/>
					"Now, the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br/>
					is both praised by the Teacher<br/>
					and revered by intelligent Brahma-farers;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> <br/>
					<span class="f3 g"><i>[224, 225]</i></span> and the venerable Kaccāna the Great is able to explain in full<br/>

					Suppose we were to approach the venerable Kaccāna the Great,<br/>
					and having approached,<br/>
					were to question him on this meaning?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these monks approached the venerable Kaccāna the Great;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					they exchanged greetings with him,<br/>
					and when they had conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>
					they sat down at a respectful distance.<br/>
					As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>
					these monks spoke thus to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend Kaccāna, the Lord,<br/>
					having recited this exposition to us in brief<br/>

					<p class="f4">Soon after the Lord had departed,<br/>
					it occurred to us, reverend Kaccāna:<br/>
					'Your reverences, the Lord, having recited this exposition to us in brief,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now, who can explain the meaning in full<br/>
					of this exposition that was recited in brief by the Lord<br/>
					but the meaning of which he did not explaining full?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, reverend Kaccāna, it occurred to us:<br/>
					'Now the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br/>
					is both praised by the Teacher<br/>
					and revered by intelligent fellow-Brahma-farers;<br/>
					and the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br/>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we were to approach the venerable Kaccāna the Great,<br/>
					and having approached,<br/>
					were to question him on this meaning?</p>

					<p class="f4">May the venerable Kaccāna the Great explain it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, as a man walking about aiming at the pith,<br/>
					searching for the pith,<br/>
					looking about for the pith<br/>
					of a great, stable and pithy tree,<br/>
					might pass by the root,<br/>
					pass by the trunk,<br/>
					thinking that the pith was to be looked for<br/>
					in the branches and foliage<br/>
					— even so is this performance of the venerable ones,<br/>
					for (although) you had the Teacher face-to-face,<br/>
					yet you have ignored that Lord<br/>
					and judge that it is I who should be questioned on this meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, your reverences,<br/>
					the Lord knows what should be known,<br/>
					sees what should be seen,<br/>
					he has become vision,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This was the time<br/>

					<p class="f4">Undoubtedly, reverend Kaccāna,<br/>
					the Lord knows what should be known,<br/>
					sees what should be seen,<br/>
					he has become vision,<br/>
					become knowledge,<br/>
					become <i>dhamma</i>,<br/>

					<p class="f4">This was the time<br/>

					<p class="f4">But the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, your reverences,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br/>
					these monks answered the venerable Kaccāna the Great in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Kaccāna the Great spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">— of this exposition which was recited in brief by the Lord<br/>

					<p class="f4">In regard to that exposition, your reverences,<br/>

					when he rose from his seat and entered a dwelling-place:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk should so investigate (things) that,<br/>
					as he investigates,<br/>
					his consciousness of what is external<br/>
					be undistracted, not diffused,<br/>
					and of what is internal<br/>
					be unslackened<br/>
					so that it may not be disturbed by grasping;<br/>
					monks, if consciousness of what is external<br/>
					be undistracted, not diffused,<br/>
					of what is internal<br/>
					be unslackened,<br/>
					then, for him who is (thus) undisturbed by grasping<br/>
					there is in the future<br/>
					no origin or rise<br/>
					of birth, old age and dying<br/>
					or of anguish."</p>

					<p class="f4">— Of this exposition which was recited by the Lord in brief<br/>
					but the meaning of which he did not explain in full,<br/>
					I, your reverences <span class="f3"><b>[229]</b></span> understand the meaning in full thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you, venerable ones, so desire,<br/>
					you can approach the Lord<br/>
					and question him as to the meaning<br/>
					so that as the Lord explains it to you<br/>
					so may you understand it."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><i>[277]</i></span> Then these monks ... (<i>as at M.</i> iii. 198-199, <i>above, p.</i> 243, <i>reading</i> Monks, a monk should so investigate (things) that ... there is in the future no origin or rise of birth, old age and dying and of anguish <i>instead of</i> The past should not be followed after, the future not desired ... He is indeed, 'Auspicious' called, described as a sage at peace) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Learned, monks, is Kaccāna the Great,<br/>
					of great wisdom, monks, is Kaccana the Great.<br/>
					For if you, monks, bad questioned me as to this meaning,<br/>
					I too would have explained it precisely as it was explained by Kaccāna the Great.<br/>
					Indeed, this is the exact meaning of that,<br/>
					and thus should you remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
