					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove,<br/>
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and the venerable Cunda, the Great<br/>
					and the venerable Channa<br/>
					were staying on Mount Vulture Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the venerable Channa was a sick man,<br/>
					in pain,<br/>
					grievously ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br/>
					approached the venerable Cunda the Great;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					he spoke thus to the venerable Cunda the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let us go on, reverend Cunda,<br/>
					and approach the venerable Channa<br/>
					so as to ask about his illness."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, reverend sir,"<br/>
					the venerable Cunda the Great answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and the venerable Cunda the Great<br/>
					approached the venerable Channa;<br/>
					having approached,<br/>
					they exchanged greetings with the venerable Channa;<br/>
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus<br/>
					to the venerable Channa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope that you, reverend Channa,<br/>
					are getting better,<br/>
					I hope you are keeping going,<br/>
					I hope the painful feelings are lessening,<br/>
					not increasing,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend Sāriputta,<br/>
					I am not without beneficial foods,<br/>
