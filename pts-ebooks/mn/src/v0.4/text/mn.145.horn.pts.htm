					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Lord was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					in the Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's, monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Puṇṇa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br/>
					approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br/>
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>
					the venerable Puṇṇa spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be good, revered sir,<br/>
					if the Lord would exhort me<br/>
					with an exhortation in brief<br/>
					so that I,<br/>
					having heard dhamma from the Lord,<br/>
					might abide alone,<br/>
					aloof,<br/>
					diligent,<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-resolute."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Puṇṇa, listen,<br/>
					attend carefully<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>
					the venerable Puṇṇa answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, Puṇṇa,<br/>
					material shapes cognisable by the eye,<br/>
					agreeable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					liked,<br/>
					enticing,<br/>

					as many as five hundred female lay-devotees,<br/>
					and he realised the three knowledges.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then after a time<br/>

					<p class="f4">A number of monks approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br/>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, that young man of family<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> named Puṇṇa<br/>

					<p class="f4">What is his bourn,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Clever, monks, was Puṇṇa<br/>
					the young man of family;<br/>
					he followed after dhamma<br/>
					according to the various parts of dhamma;<br/>
					and he did not annoy me<br/>
					with questionings about dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Puṇṇa the young man of family<br/>
