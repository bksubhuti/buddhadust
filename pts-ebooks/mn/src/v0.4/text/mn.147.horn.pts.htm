					<p class="f4">At one time<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in the Jeta Grove in <span class="mozp">Anāthapiṇḍika's</span> monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as the Lord was in solitary meditation<br/>
					a reasoning arose in his mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mature now in Rāhula<br/>
					are the things<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> that bring freedom to <span class="f2 g"><b>[329]</b></span> maturity.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to train Rahula further<br/>
					in the destruction of the cankers?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And having dressed in the early morning<br/>
					the Lord, taking his bowl and robe,<br/>
					entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had walked in Sāvatthī for almsfood,<br/>
					on returning from the alms-gathering after the meal<br/>
					he addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Take your piece of cloth for sitting on,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> Rāhula;<br/>
					we will go to the Blind Men's Grove<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					for the day-sojourn."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>
					answered the venerable Rāhula<br/>
					in assent to the Lord<br/>
					and, taking his piece of cloth for sitting on,<br/>
					he followed closely after the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>
					various thousands of <i>devas</i> were following the Lord,<br/>
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Today the Lord will train the venerable Rāhula further<br/>
					in the destruction of the cankers."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord plunged into the Blind Men's Grove<br/>
					and sat down on a seat made ready<br/>
					at the root of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Rāhula,<br/>
					having greeted the Lord,<br/>
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br/>
					to the venerable Rahula<br/>
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>
