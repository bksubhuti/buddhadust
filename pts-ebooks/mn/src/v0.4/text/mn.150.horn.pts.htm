					<p class="f4">At one time, the Lord,<br/>
					walking on tour among the Kosalans<br/>
					together with a large Order of monks,<br/>
					arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans called Nagaravinda.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman householders of Nagaravinda heard it said that</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, the recluse Gotama,<br/>
					gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br/>
					and walking on tour among the Kosalans<br/>
					together with a large Order of monks,<br/>
					has arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans called Nagaravinda.</p>

					<p class="f4">A lovely reputation concerning the recluse Gotama has gone abroad thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is indeed Lord,<br/>
					perfected one,<br/>
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br/>
					endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,<br/>
					Well-farer,<br/>
					knower of the worlds,<br/>
					the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					the Awakened One,<br/>
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having realised through his own super-knowledge,<br/>
					he makes known this world<br/>
					together with devas<br/>
					including the Māras and the Brahmās;<br/>
					creatures<br/>
					together with recluses and brahmans,<br/>
					with devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>dhamma</i><br/>
					that is lovely at the beginning,<br/>
					lovely in the middle<br/>
					and lovely at the ending;<br/>
					he explains with the spirit and the letter<br/>
					the Brahma-faring<br/>
					completely fulfilled<br/>
					and wholly purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good indeed is the sight<br/>
					of perfected ones such as this."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman householders of Nagaravinda<br/>
					approached the Lord;<br/>
					having approached him,<br/>
					some exchanged greetings with the Lord<br/>
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>
					they sat down at a respectful distance;<br/>
					some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br/>
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br/>
					some, having informed <span class="f2 g"><b>[340]</b></span> the Lord of their names and clans,<br/>
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br/>
					some, becoming silent,<br/>
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br/>
