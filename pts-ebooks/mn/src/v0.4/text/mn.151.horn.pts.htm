					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove<br/>
					at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					emerging from solitary meditation towards <span class="f2 g"><b>[343]</b></span> evening,<br/>
					approached the Lord; having approached and greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Your faculties are very bright, Sāriputta,<br/>
					your complexion very pure,<br/>
					very clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">In which abiding are you, Sāriputta,<br/>
					now abiding in the fullness thereof?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Abiding in (the concept of) emptiness do I, revered sir,<br/>
					now abide in the fullness thereof."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"It is good, Sāriputta,<br/>
					it is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">You, Sāriputta, are now indeed abiding in fullness<br/>
					in the abiding of great men.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">For this is the abiding of great men, Sāriputta,<br/>
					that is to say (the concept of) emptiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Wherefore, Sāriputta, if a monk should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I now abide in fullness<br/>
					in the abiding in (the concept of) emptiness,'</p>

					<p class="f4">that monk should consider thus, Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Sāriputta, all those recluses and brahmans who at present<br/>
					completely purify themselves for alms-gathering<br/>
					do so only after having reflected over and over again in these ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Sāriputta, this is how you must train yourself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will completely purify myself for alms-gathering<br/>
					after having reflected over and over again.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how you, Sāriputta, must train yourself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, the venerable Sāriputta rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
