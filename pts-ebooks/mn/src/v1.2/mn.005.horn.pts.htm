    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there<br/> the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Your reverence," these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">There is here the person without a blemish<br/> who thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">Your reverence, it is like a bronze bowl,<br/> brought back from a shop or smithy<br/> covered with dust and dirt<br/> and that the owners would not make use of or clean,<br/> but would throw away in the dust.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 137 notes that there is both a conventional teaching and a teaching according to ultimate truth <i>(paramatthadesanā).</i> Herein "individual person, being, woman, man, <i>khattiya, brahman, deva, Māra</i>" come under conventional meaning; and "impermanence, anguish, insubstantiality, the <i>khandhas,</i> the elements, the planes, the applications of mindfulness" under ultimate truth. "The four persons are to be understood in the conventional way" (<i>MA.</i> i. 139).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 139 calls this <i>satta-loka,</i> the world of beings.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>MA.</i> 368: "attachment, hatred and folly are called the three blemishes." <i>MA.</i> i. 139ff. equates them with the defilements, the <i>kilhesa.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>sappaṭi-puggala. MA.</i> i. 144 says this means "an equal person. 'Equal' means one who has an offence. <i>'Paṭi-puggala'</i> means the reprover. He thinks it possible to say, wishing for reproof from one who has an offence, 'You have fallen into this and that offence. You can reprove me after you have confessed it.' Or, he may wish for reproof from one of his own birth, family, learning, experience, or ascetic practice."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>I.e.</i> of the procession walking for almsfood to be put into their bowls.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 149 says that this may be due to three causes: because they are cut with a knife, sewn with a coarse long thread, or stained by dust.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> <i>I.e.</i> to go and take his meals at houses (either as a regular diner, or as one specially invited) instead of walking for his almsfood. <i>Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> iii. 391.</p>

So Giribbaja, which is usually taken as a name for Rājagaha, is the Cowpen in the mountains which surround Rājagaha.</p>
