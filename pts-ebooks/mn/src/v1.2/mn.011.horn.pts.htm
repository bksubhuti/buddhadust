    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there, the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered one," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">But this situation occurs, monks,<br/> when wanderers belonging to other sects<br/> might herein speak thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just here is a recluse,<br/> here a second recluse, here a third recluse,<br/> here a fourth recluse;<br/> void of recluses are other (systems teaching) alien views?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if there are wanderers belonging to other sects who speak thus,<br/> they should be spoken to thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, there are these four (kinds of) grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The grasping of sense-pleasures,<br/> the grasping of view,<br/> the grasping of rule and custom,<br/> the grasping of the theory of self.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are some recluses and brahmans who,<br/> although pretending to a comprehension<br/> of all the graspings,<br/> do not lay down rightly<br/> a comprehension of all the graspings;<br/> they lay down a comprehension<br/> of the grasping of sense-pleasures,<br/> but do not lay down a comprehension<br/> of the grasping of view,<br/> of the grasping of rule and custom,<br/> of the grasping of the theory of self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the cause of this?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is that these worthy recluses and brahmans<br/> do not understand three situations<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">In such a <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline as this, monks,<br/> that which is confidence in the Teacher<br/> is shown to be not perfect,<br/> that which is confidence in <i>Dhamma</i><br/> is shown to be not perfect,<br/> that which is fulfilment of the moral habits<br/> is shown to be not perfect,<br/> that which is regard and affection for one's fellow <i>Dhamma</i>-men<br/> is shown to be not perfect.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the cause of this?</p>
