    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anathapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered One," <span class="f2 g"><b>[153]</b></span> these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk is intent on the higher thought,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> from time to time<br/> he should attend to five characteristics.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, whatever may be the characteristic which a monk attends to,<br/> if there arise evil unskilled thoughts associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> that monk should attend,<br/> instead of to that characteristic,<br/> to another characteristic<br/> which is associated with what is skilled.</p>

    <p class="f4">By attending to this other characteristic<br/> which is associated with what is skilled<br/> instead of to that characteristic,<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion<br/> are got rid of,<br/> they come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">From getting rid of these,<br/> his mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">As, monks, a skilled carpenter<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> or a carpenters apprentice<br/> might knock out,<br/> drive out,<br/> draw out<br/> a large peg with a small peg —<br/> even so, monks, whatever may be the characteristic which a monk attends to,<br/> if there arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> that monk should attend,<br/> instead of to that characteristic,<br/> to another characteristic<br/> which is associated with what is skilled.</p>

    <p class="f4">By attending to this other characteristic<br/> which is associated with what is skilled<br/> instead of to that characteristic,<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion —<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">From getting rid of these,<br/> his mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if while the monk is attending,<br/> instead of to that characteristic,<br/> to this other characteristic<br/> which is associated with what is skilled,<br/> there still arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> then the peril of these thoughts should be scrutinised by that monk, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed these are unskilled thoughts,<br/> indeed these are <span class="f2 g"><b>[154]</b></span> thoughts that have errors,<br/> indeed these are thoughts that are of painful results.'</p>

    <p class="f4">While he is scrutinizing the peril of these thoughts,<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts that are associated with desire,<br/> associated with aversion,<br/> associated with confusion,<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these,<br/> his mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, it is like<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> a woman or a man,<br/> young,<br/> in the prime of life,<br/> fond of adornment,<br/> who, if the carcase of a snake<br/> or the carcase of a dog<br/> or the carcase of a human being<br/> were hanging round the neck,<br/> would be revolted,<br/> ashamed,<br/> disgusted —<br/> even so, monks, while the monk is attending,<br/> instead of to this characteristic,<br/> to that other characteristic<br/> which is associated with what is skilled,<br/> there still arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> then the peril of these thoughts should be scrutinised by that monk, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed these are unskilled thoughts,<br/> indeed these are thoughts that have errors,<br/> indeed these are thoughts that are of painful results.'</p>

    <p class="f4">While he is scrutinizing the peril of these thoughts,<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts that are associated with desire,<br/> associated with aversion,<br/> associated with confusion,<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these,<br/> his mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if while the monk is scrutinizing the peril of those thoughts,<br/> there still arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> that monk should bring about forgetfulness of<br/> and lack of attention to those thoughts;<br/> having come to forgetfulness<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> of<br/> and lack of attention to these thoughts,<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion -<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these,<br/> the mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, it is like a man with vision<br/> who might not want to see the material shapes<br/> that come within his range of vision;<br/> he would close his eyes<br/> or look another way -<br/> even so, monks,<br/> if while the monk is scrutinizing the peril of those thoughts<br/> there still arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> that monk should bring about forgetfulness of<br/> and lack of attention to those thoughts;<br/> having come to forgetfulness of<br/> and lack of attention to these thoughts,<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion -<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these,<br/> the mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if when the monk has brought about forgetfulness of<br/> and lack of attention to those thoughts,<br/> there still arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion, monks,<br/> that monk should attend to the thought function<br/> and form of those thoughts.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he is attending to the thought function<br/> and form of those thoughts,<br/> those that are evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these<br/> the mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, even as it might occur to a man<br/> who is walking quickly:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, why do I walk quickly?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to walk slowly?'</p>

    <p class="f4">It might occur to him<br/> as he was walking slowly:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, why do I walk <span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span> slowly?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to stand?'</p>

    <p class="f4">It might occur to him as he was standing:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, why do I stand?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to sit down?'</p>

    <p class="f4">It might occur to him as he was sitting down:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, why do I sit down?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to lie down?' -</p>

    <p class="f4">even so, monks, the man,<br/> having abandoned the very hardest posture,<br/> might take to the easiest posture itself.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, monks, if while the monk has brought about forgetfulness of<br/> and lack of attention to those thoughts<br/> there still arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion, monks,<br/> that monk should attend to the thought function<br/> and form of those thoughts.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he is attending to the thought function<br/> and form of those thoughts,<br/> those that are evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these<br/> the mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if while the monk is attending to the thought function<br/> and form of those thoughts,<br/> there still arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion, monks,<br/> that monk, his teeth clenched,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> his tongue pressed against his palate,<br/> should by his mind subdue,<br/> restrain<br/> and dominate the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">While, with his teeth clenched,<br/> his tongue pressed against his palate,<br/> he is with the mind subduing,<br/> restraining and dominating the mind,<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these,<br/> the mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, even as a strong man,<br/> having taken hold of a weaker man by the head or shoulders,<br/> might subdue,<br/> restrain<br/> and dominate him,<br/> even so, monks,<br/> if while that monk is attending to the thought function<br/> and form of those thoughts,<br/> there still arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> then, monks, that monk,<br/> his teeth clenched,<br/> his tongue pressed against his palate,<br/> should by his mind subdue,<br/> restrain and dominate his mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">While, with his teeth clenched,<br/> his tongue pressed against his palate,<br/> he is by the mind subduing,<br/> restraining and dominating the mind,<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> are got rid of,<br/> they come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these,<br/> the mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if while a monk,<br/> in regard to some characteristic,<br/> is attending to that characteristic,<br/> there arise evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> then if he attends,<br/> instead of to that characteristic,<br/> to some other characteristic<br/> which is associated with what is skilled,<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated <span class="f2 g"><b>[156]</b></span> with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these,<br/> the mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">And by scrutinizing the peril of these thoughts,<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts<br/> associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these,<br/> the mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he comes to forgetfulness of<br/> and lack of attention to<br/> those evil unskilled thoughts<br/> that are associated with desire<br/> and associated with aversion<br/> and associated with confusion,<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> these come to an end.<br/> By getting rid of these,<br/> the mind subjectively steadies,<br/> calms,<br/> is one-pointed,<br/> concentrated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, this monk is called<br/> one who is master in the method and paths of thought;<br/> he can think whatever thought he wishes;<br/> he will not think any thought that he does not wish;<br/> he has cut off craving,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> done away with fetter, and,<br/> by fully mastering pride,<br/> has made an end of anguish."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
