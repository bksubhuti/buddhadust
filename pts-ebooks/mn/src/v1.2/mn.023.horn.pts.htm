    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthi<br/> in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the vellerable Kassapa the Boy<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> was staying in the Blind Men's Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, when the night was far spent<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> a certain deva<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> with a glorious skin,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> having illuminated the whole of the Blind Men's Grove,<br/> approached the venerable Kassapa the Boy;<br/> and having approached<br/> stood at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">While standing at one side<br/> this deva spoke thus<br/> to the venerable Kassapa the Boy:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Monk, monk,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> this ant-hill smokes by night,<br/> blazes up by day.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">A brahman speaks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Bringing a tool, clever one,<br/> dig it up.'</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The clever one,<br/> digging when he had brought a tool<br/> saw a bolt and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A bolt, revered one.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Take out the bolt,<br/> dig on, clever one,<br/> bringing a tool'</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The clever one,<br/> digging on when he had brought a tool,<br/> saw a frog,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A frog, revered one.'</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The brahman spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Take out the frog,<br/> dig on, clever one,<br/> bringing a tool.'</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The clever one,<br/> digging on when he had brought a tool,<br/> saw a forked path,<br/> and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A forked path, revered one.'</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The brahman spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Take out the forked path,<br/> dig on, clever one,<br/> bringing a tool.'</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The clever one,<br/> digging on when he had brought <span class="f2 g"><b>[184]</b></span> a tool,<br/> saw a strainer,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">If you, monk,<br/> having approached the Lord,<br/> were to ask him about these questions,<br/> then you could remember<br/> as the Lord explains to you.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, monk,<br/> do not see anyone in the world<br/> with its devas,<br/> with its Māras,<br/> with its Brahmās,<br/> in creation,<br/> with its recluses and brahmans,<br/> its devas and men,<br/> who could turn his mind<br/> to expounding these questions<br/> except a Tathāgata<br/> or a Tathāgata's disciple<br/> or one who has heard (the teaching) from them."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke that deva;<br/> and vanished then and there,<br/> having said this.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This is Kumāra-Kassapa, so called even when he was grown up, <i>MA.</i> ii. 120. He lived in Blind Men's Grove fulfilling the course for learners, <i>MA.</i> ii. 124. He took this sutta as the subject of his meditations and so developed insight and won arahantship, <i>MA.</i> ii. 134. He was therefore not an arahant at the time when it was delivered.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> This is the meaning attributed to <i>abhikkantāya</i> by <i>MA.</i> ii. 124 — the meaning of "waning" as against its other meaning of "lovely," "beautiful" and "wonderful" (in the sense of assenting).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>MA.</i> ii. 124: <i>"devatā"</i> is the common (general or joint) appellation of <i>devas,</i> and daughters of <i>devas.</i> Here it means a <i>deva." Cf.</i> <i>SA.</i> ii. 14, which says here it means <i>devaputta</i>.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>abhikkantavaṇṇā.</i> <i>MA.</i> ii. 125 says <i>abhikkanta</i> is here in its sense of "beautiful," <i>abhirūpa;</i> and among seven meanings attributed to <i>vaṇṇa,</i> the first, that of "skin," <i>chavi,</i> is meant.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> The <i>deva</i> and Kassapa had been two of five friends in the time of the Buddha Kassapa. Therefore the <i>deva</i> did not greet him, <i>MA.</i> ii. 126.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>uddhumāyikā = maṇḍūka,</i> <i>MA.</i> ii. 128.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>caṅgavāra,</i> explained at <i>MA.</i> ii. 128 as <i>khāraparissāvanna,</i> strainer for potash? <i>Cf. cangavāraka</i> at <i>Miln.</i> 365, translated as "dyers' straining cloth"; and <i>Jā.</i> v. 186, translated as "sieve." <i>Jā. Comy.</i> says "as water placed in a dyers' <i>khāracaṅgavāra</i> quickly runs out." Neumann's translation. <i>Majjh.,</i> I 239, gives <i>Geflecht,</i> basket-work. Chalmers has "strainer."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>MA.</i> ii. 128 say a large knife for cutting up meat as well as a block.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> This description of the body occurs also at <i>M.</i> i. 500, ii. 17; <i>S.</i> iv. 83; <i>D.</i> i. 76.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> definition of brahman at <i>A.</i> iv. 144, quoted at <i>MA.</i> ii. 130.</p>
