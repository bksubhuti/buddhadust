    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[306]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> in the Eastern Monastery<br/> in the palace of Migāra's mother.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> approached the Lord;<br/> having approached,<br/> having greeted the Lord,<br/> he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br/> Sakka, the lord of <i>devas,</i> spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Briefly, Lord, to what extent<br/> does a monk come to be freed<br/> by the destruction of craving,<br/> completely fulfilled,<br/> completely secure from the bonds,<br/> a complete Brahma-farer,<br/> complete as to his culmination,<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> best of <i>devas</i> and men?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"As to this, lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> a monk comes to hear:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is not fitting<br/> that there should be inclination<br/> towards any (psycho-physical) conditions.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">If, lord of <i>devas,</i> a monk comes to hear this, that</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is not fitting<br/> that there should be inclination<br/> towards any (psycho-physical) conditions,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he knows all the conditions thoroughly;<br/> by knowing all the conditions thoroughly<br/> he knows all the conditions accurately;<br/> by knowing all the conditions accurately,<br/> whatever feeling he feels,<br/> pleasant<br/> or painful<br/> or neither painful nor pleasant,<br/> he abides viewing impermanence,<br/> he abides viewing dispassion,<br/> he abides viewing stopping,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> he abides viewing renunciation<br/> in regard to those feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he is abiding viewing impermanence,<br/> when he is abiding viewing dispassion,<br/> when he is abiding viewing stopping,<br/> when he is abiding viewing renunciation<br/> in regard to these feelings,<br/> he grasps after nothing in the world;<br/> not grasping<br/> he is not troubled;<br/> being untroubled he himself is <span class="f2 g"><b>[307]</b></span><br/> individually attained to <i>nibbāna</i>,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> and he comprehends:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br/> brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br/> done is what was to be done,<br/> there is no more of being such or such'.</p>

    <p class="f4">Briefly, it is to this extent, lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> that a monk comes to be freed<br/> by the destruction of craving,<br/> completely fulfilled,<br/> completely secure from the bonds,<br/> a complete Brahma-farer,<br/> complete as to his culmination,<br/> best of <i>devas</i> and men."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> having rejoiced in what the Lord had said,<br/> having given thanks,<br/> having greeted the Lord,<br/> vanished then and there<br/> keeping his right side towards him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> was sitting down near the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, did that yakkha,<br/> when he thanked the Lord for his words,<br/> grasp them or not?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose that I should find out<br/> whether that yakkha,<br/> when he thanked the Lord for his words,<br/> grasped them or not?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/> as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm<br/> or might bend back his out-stretched arm,<br/> vanishing from the palace of Migāra's mother in the Eastern Monastery,<br/> appeared among the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> equipped and provided with five hundred deva-like musical instruments,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> was amusing himself in the One Lotus pleasure grove.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> saw the venerable Moggallāna the Great coming in the distance;<br/> seeing him,<br/> having had those five hundred deva-like musical instruments stopped,<br/> he approached the venerable Moggallāna the Great;<br/> having approached,<br/> he spoke thus to the venerable Moggal-lāna the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come, my good Moggallāna,<br/> you are welcome, my good Moggallāna;<br/> at last, my good Moggallāna,<br/> you take this occasion for coming here;<br/> sit down, my good Moggallāna,<br/> this seat is appointed."</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Moggallāna the Great sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> having taken a low seat,<br/> sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> spoke thus to Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[308]</b></span> "In regard to the talk that the Lord spoke in brief to you, Kosiya,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> on freedom by the destruction of craving,<br/> it were good even for me to hear portions of this talk."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, my good Moggallāna, am very busy,<br/> there is much to be done by me;<br/> both on my own account there are things to be done,<br/> and there are also (still more)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> things to be done<br/> for the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three.</p>

    <p class="f4">Further, my good Moggallāna,<br/> it was properly heard,<br/> properly learnt,<br/> properly attended to,<br/> properly reflected upon,<br/> so that it cannot vanish quickly.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> my good Moggallāna,<br/> a battle was in full swing between <i>devas</i> and demons.</p>

    <p class="f4">In that battle, my good Moggallāna,<br/> the <i>devas</i> conquered,<br/> the demons were defeated.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, my good Moggallāna,<br/> having won that battle<br/> and being victorious in the, battle,<br/> when I came back from there<br/> built a palace named Vejayanta<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> (Victory).</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, my good Moggallāna,<br/> there are a hundred towers to the Vejayanta Palace,<br/> in each tower there are seven gabled houses,<br/> in each gabled house there are seven nymphs,<br/> and for each nymph there are seven attendants.</p>

    <p class="f4">Would you, my good Moggallāna,<br/> like to see the delights of the Vejayanta Palace?"</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Moggallāna the Great consented by becoming silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> and the great rajah Vessavaṇa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> having put the venerable Moggallāna the Great in front of them<br/> approached Vejayanta Palace.</p>

    <p class="f4">The female attendants of Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> saw the venerable Moggallāna the Great coming in the distance;<br/> on seeing him,<br/> shrinking and shy,<br/> each entered her own inner room.</p>

    <p class="f4">As a daughter-in-law<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> shrinks and is shy on seeing her father-in-law,<br/> even so did the female attendants of Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> on seeing the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/> shrinking and shy,<br/> each enter her own inner room.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Sakka, the lord of <i>devas,</i> and Vessavaṇa, the great rajah,<br/> made the <span class="f2 g"><b>[309]</b></span> venerable Moggallāna the Great follow them into the Vejayanta Palace<br/> and roam about in it,<br/> and (they said):</p>

    <p class="f4">"My dear Moggallāna, see this delight of the Vejayanta Palace, and,<br/> dear Moggallāna, see that delight of the Vejayanta Palace."</p>

    <p class="f4">"This shines forth as a deed of merit<br/> formerly done by the venerable Kosiya,<br/> and people seeing anything delightful speak thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed it shines forth from the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three,<br/> that is to say it shines forth as a deed of merit<br/> formerly done by the venerable Kosiya.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This <i>yakkha</i> lives much too indolently.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose that I were to agitate this <i>yakkha?'</i></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> worked such a working of psychic power<br/> that with his big toe he made Vejayanta Palace<br/> tremble, shake and quake.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the minds of Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> and of the great rajah Vessavaṇa<br/> and of the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three<br/> were full of wonder and marvel, and they said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed, the great psychic power,<br/> the great majesty<br/> of the recluse is wonderful,<br/> it is indeed marvellous,<br/> inasmuch as with his big toe<br/> he makes this <i>deva</i>-like abode<br/> tremble, shake and quake."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/> knowing that Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> was agitated and astounded,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> spoke thus to Sakka, the lord of dems:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In regard to the talk that the Lord spoke in brief to you, Kosiya,<br/> on freedom by the destruction of craving,<br/> it were good even for me to hear portions of that talk."</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to that I, my good Moggallāna,<br/> approached the Lord;<br/> having approached,<br/> having greeted the Lord,<br/> I stood at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As I was standing at a respectful distance, my good Moggallāna,<br/> I spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Briefly, Lord, to what extent<br/> does a monk come to be freed by the destruction of craving,<br/> completely fulfilled,<br/> completely secure from the bonds,<br/> a complete Brahma-farer,<br/> complete as to his culmination,<br/> best of <i>devas</i> and men?</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said, my good Moggallāna,<br/> the Lord spoke thus to me;</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is not fitting<br/> that there should be inclination<br/> towards any (psycho-physical) conditions.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If, lord of <i>devas,</i> a monk comes to hear this, that</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is not fitting<br/> that there should be inclination<br/> towards any (psycho-physical) conditions,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he knows all the conditions thoroughly;<br/> by knowing all the conditions thoroughly<br/> he knows all the conditions accurately;<br/> by knowing all the conditions accurately,<br/> whatever feeling he feels,<br/> pleasant<br/> or painful<br/> or neither painful nor pleasant,<br/> he abides viewing impermanence,<br/> he abides viewing dispassion,<br/> he abides viewing stopping,<br/> he abides viewing renunciation<br/> in regard to those feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he is abiding viewing impermanence,<br/> when he is abiding viewing dispassion,<br/> when he is abiding viewing stopping,<br/> when he is abiding viewing renunciation<br/> in regard to these feelings,<br/> he grasps after nothing in the world;<br/> not grasping<br/> he is not troubled;<br/> being untroubled he himself is<br/> individually attained to <i>nibbāna,</i> and he comprehends:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br/> brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br/> done is what was to be done,<br/> there is no more of being such or such'.</p>

    <p class="f4">Briefly, it is to this extent, lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> that a monk comes to be freed by the destruction of craving,<br/> completely fulfilled,<br/> completely secure from the bonds,<br/> a complete Brahma-farer,<br/> complete as to his culmination,<br/> best of <i>devas</i> and <span class="f2 g"><b>[310]</b></span> men.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, my good Moggallāna,<br/> did the Lord speak to me briefly<br/> on freedom by the destruction of craving."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/> having rejoiced in what Sakka, the lord of <i>devas,</i> had said,<br/> having given thanks,<br/> as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm<br/> or might bend back his outstretched arm,<br/> vanishing even so<br/> from among the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three,<br/> did he become manifest in the palace of Migāra's mother<br/> in the Eastern Monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then soon after the venerable Moggallāna the Great had departed,<br/> the female attendants of Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> spake thus to Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good sir, is not this lord your teacher?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good ladies, this lord is not my teacher,<br/> he is a fellow Brahma-farer of mine,<br/> the venerable Moggallāna the Great."</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is a gain for you, good sir,<br/> that this fellow Brahma-farer of yours<br/> is of such great psychic potency,<br/> of such great majesty;<br/> certainly this lord is your teacher."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great approached the Lord;<br/> having approached,<br/> having greeted the Lord,<br/> he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/> the venerable Moggallāna the Great spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, does the Lord know<br/> that just now he spoke in brief<br/> on freedom by the destruction of craving<br/> to a very powerful <i>yakkha?"</i></p>

    <p class="f4">"I know, Moggallāna,<br/> that Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> approached me here;<br/> having approached,<br/> having greeted me,<br/> he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br/> Sakka, the lord of <i>devas,</i> spoke thus to me, Moggallāna:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Briefly, Lord, to what extent<br/> does a monk come to be freed by the destruction of craving,<br/> completely fulfilled,<br/> completely secure from the bonds,<br/> a complete Brahma-farer,<br/> complete as to his culmination,<br/> best of <i>devas</i> and men?</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said, I, Moggallāna,<br/> spoke thus to Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>:</p>

    <p class="f4">'As to this, lord of <i>devas,</i> a monk comes to hear:</p>

    <p class="f4">When he is <span class="f2 g"><b>[311]</b></span> abiding viewing impermanence,<br/> when he is abiding viewing dispassion,<br/> when he is abiding viewing stopping,<br/> when he is abiding viewing renunciation<br/> in regard to these feelings,<br/> he grasps after nothing in the world;<br/> not grasping<br/> he is not troubled;<br/> being untroubled he himself is<br/> individually attained to <i>nibbāna,</i> and he comprehends:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br/> brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br/> done is what was to be done,<br/> there is no more of being such or such'.</p>

    <p class="f4">Briefly, it is to this extent, lord of <i>devas</i>,<br/> that a monk comes to be freed by the destruction of craving,<br/> completely fulfilled,<br/> completely secure from the bonds,<br/> a complete Brahma-farer,<br/> complete as to his culmination,<br/> best of <i>devas</i> and men.'</p>

    <p class="f4">I, Moggallāna, know that I spoke in brief thus<br/> on freedom by the destruction of craving to Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Delighted, the venerable Moggallāna the Great rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
