    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[379]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthi<br/> in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered one," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, an inquiring monk,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> learning the range<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of another's mind,<br/> should make a study<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> of the Tathāgata<br/> so as to distinguish<br/> whether he is a fully Self-awakened One<br/> or not."</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> Lord,<br/> things are rooted in the Lord,<br/> have the Lord for their conduit,<br/> the Lord for their arbiter.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well for us, Lord,<br/> if the Lord would reveal the meaning of this saying;<br/> having heard the Lord,<br/> the monks will remember."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very well, monks;<br/> listen,<br/> attend carefully<br/> and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord,"<br/> these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, an inquiring monk,<br/> learning the range of another's mind,<br/> should make a study of the Tathāgata<br/> in regard to two things:<br/> things cognisable through the eye<br/> and through the ear,<br/> thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do those that are impure states<br/> cognisable through the eye and the ear<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> exist in a Tathāgata or not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">While he is studying this<br/> he knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Those impure states<br/> which are cognisable through the eye and the ear<br/> do not exist in a Tathāgata.'</p>

    <p class="f4">After he has studied this<br/> and knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Those impure states<br/> which are cognisable through the eye and the ear<br/> do not exist in a Tathāgata,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he then studies further, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do those that are mixed states<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> cognisable through the eye and the ear<br/> exist in a Tathāgata or not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">While he is studying this<br/> he knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Those mixed states<br/> cognisable through the eye and the ear<br/> do not exist in a Tathāgata.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[380]</b></span> After he has studied this<br/> and knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Those mixed states<br/> cognisable through the eye and the ear<br/> do not exist in a Tathāgata,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he then studies further,<br/> thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do those that are absolutely pure states<br/> cognisable through the eye and the ear<br/> exist in a Tathāgata or not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">While he is studying this<br/> he knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Those which are absolutely pure states<br/> cognisable through the eye and the ear<br/> exist in a Tathāgata.'</p>

    <p class="f4">After he has studied this<br/> and knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'These absolutely pure states<br/> which are cognisable through the eye and the ear<br/> exist in the Tathāgata,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he then studies further,<br/> thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Has this venerable one<br/> been possessed of this skilled state<br/> for a long time<br/> or only for a short time?'</p>

    <p class="f4">While he is studying this<br/> he knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This venerable one<br/> has been possessed of this skilled state<br/> for a long time,<br/> this venerable one<br/> has not been possessed of it<br/> for only a short time.'</p>

    <p class="f4">After he has studied this<br/> and knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This venerable one<br/> has been possessed of this skilled state<br/> for a long time,<br/> this venerable one<br/> has not been possessed of it<br/> for only a short time,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he then studies further:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do there exist any perils<br/> for that venerable monk<br/> who has attained to fame<br/> and won renown?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, there are some perils<br/> that do not exist here for a monk<br/> until he has attained to fame<br/> and won renown.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is, monks,<br/> after a monk has attained to fame<br/> and won renown<br/> that some perils exist for him here.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he is studying this<br/> he knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Although the venerable monk<br/> has attained to fame and won renown,<br/> some perils do not exist for him here.'</p>

    <p class="f4">After he has studied this<br/> and knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Although this venerable monk<br/> has attained to fame and won renown,<br/> some perils do not exist for him here,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he then studies further:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Does this venerable one<br/> refrain out of fearlessness,<br/> does not he refrain out of fear?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Is it because,<br/> through the destruction of attachment,<br/> that, being without attachment,<br/> he does not follow pleasures of the senses?'</p>

    <p class="f4">As he is studying this<br/> he knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This venerable one<br/> refrains out of fearlessness,<br/> this venerable one refrains<br/> not out of fear;<br/> he does not follow pleasures of the senses<br/> because, through the destruction of attachment,<br/> he is without attachment.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, others should question this monk thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What are the venerable one's facts,<br/> what his evidence<br/> by reason of which<br/> the venerable one speaks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This venerable one<br/> refrains out of <span class="f2 g"><b>[381]</b></span> fearlessness,<br/> this venerable one<br/> refrains not out of fear;<br/> he does not follow pleasures of the senses<br/> because, through the destruction of attachment,<br/> he is without attachment'?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, a monk answering properly<br/> would answer thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This venerable one,<br/> whether staying in an Order<br/> or staying alone,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> whether those near him are progressing well,<br/> whether they are progressing badly,<br/> whether they lead a group,<br/> whether they are engaged<br/> with any material things here<br/> or whether they are unstained<br/> by any material things here –<br/> this venerable one<br/> does not despise them because of this.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This have I heard<br/> face to face with the Lord,<br/> this have I learnt<br/> face to face with him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am restrained out of fearlessness,<br/> I am not restrained out of fear;<br/> without attachment because of the destruction of attachment,<br/> I do not follow pleasures of the senses.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, the Tathāgata should himself<br/> be further questioned hereon:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do those impure states<br/> cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br/> exist in the Tathāgata or not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, in answering,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> a Tathāgata would answer thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Those impure states<br/> cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br/> do not exist in a Tathāgata.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do those mixed states<br/> cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br/> exist in a Tathāgata or not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, in answering,<br/> a Tathāgata would answer thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Those mixed states<br/> cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br/> do not exist in a Tathāgata.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do those absolutely pure states<br/> cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br/> exist in a Tathāgata or not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, in answering,<br/> a Tathāgata would answer thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Those absolutely pure states<br/> cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br/> exist in a Tathāgata.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my path,<br/> this is my pasture<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/> and no one is like (me) in this.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, a disciple should draw near<br/> a teacher who speaks like this<br/> so as to hear <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

    <p class="f4">From further to further,<br/> from excellence to excellence,<br/> the Teacher teaches him <i>Dhamma,</i><br/> what is dark<br/> and what is bright,<br/> with their counterparts.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">As, monks, the Teacher<br/> gradually teaches <span class="f2 g"><b>[382]</b></span> <i>Dhamma</i> to the monk,<br/> from further to further,<br/> from excellence to excellence,<br/> what is dark and what is bright<br/> with their counterparts,<br/> so does he gradually<br/> by his superknowledge<br/> of point after point of <i>Dhamma</i><br/> come to fulfilment in <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

    <p class="f4">He has confidence in the Teacher,<br/> that:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Lord is a fully Self-awakened One,<br/> well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br/> the Order fares along well.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if others should ask that monk:</p>

    <p class="f4">'But what are the venerable one's facts,<br/> what the evidence<br/> by reason of which he speaks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Lord is a fully Self-awakened one,<br/> well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br/> the Order fares along well?'</p>

    <p class="f4">that monk, monks,<br/> answering rightly<br/> would answer thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, your reverences,<br/> drew near the Lord<br/> so as to hear <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord taught me <i>Dhamma</i><br/> from further to further,<br/> from excellence to excellence,<br/> what is dark<br/> and what is bright<br/> with their counterparts.</p>

    <p class="f4">As the Lord gradually taught me <i>Dhamma</i><br/> from further to further,<br/> from excellence to excellence,<br/> what is dark and what is bright<br/> with their counterparts,<br/> so did I gradually<br/> by my superknowledge<br/> of point after point in <i>Dhamma</i><br/> come to fulfilment in <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

    <p class="f4">I have confidence in the Teacher,<br/> that:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Lord is a fully Self-awakened One,<br/> well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br/> the Order fares along well.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, in anyone<br/> in whom faith in the Teacher is established,<br/> rooted,<br/> supported by these methods,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span><br/> by these sentences,<br/> by these words,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/> that faith is called reasoned,<br/> based on vision,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/> strong;<br/> it is indestructible<br/> by a recluse<br/> or brahman<br/> or <i>deva</i><br/> or Māra<br/> or a Brahmā<br/> or by anyone in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, does there come to be<br/> study of the Tathāgata's <i>Dhamma,</i><br/> and thus does the Tathāgata<br/> come to be well studied<br/> in the proper manner."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
