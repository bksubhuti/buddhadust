    <h2>Kosambīya Sutta</h2>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[383]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Kosambī<br/> in Ghosita's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time, the monks of Kosambī,<br/> disputatious,<br/> quarrelsome,<br/> contentious,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> lived wounding another with the weapons of the tongue.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">They neither convinced one another<br/> nor came to be convinced themselves,<br/> nor did they win one another over<br/> or come to be won over themselves.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain monk approached the Lord;<br/> having approached,<br/> having greeted the Lord,<br/> he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/> that monk spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, Lord, the monks of Kosambī,<br/> disputatious,<br/> quarrelsome,<br/> contentious,<br/> live wounding another with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

    <p class="f4">They neither convinced one another<br/> nor came to be convinced themselves,<br/> nor did they win one another over<br/> or come to be won over themselves."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed a certain monk,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come you, monk,<br/> summon these monks in my name,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Teacher is summoning you.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Lord,"<br/> and this monk,<br/> having answered the Lord in assent,<br/> approached those monks;<br/> having approached,<br/> he spoke thus to those monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Teacher is summoning the venerable ones."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br/> and those monks<br/> having answered that monk in assent,<br/> approached the Lord;<br/> having approached,<br/> having greeted the Lord,<br/> they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br/> to those monks<br/> as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is it true, as is said, that you, monks,<br/> are disputatious,<br/> quarrelsome,<br/> contentious,<br/> and live wounding another with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

    <p class="f4">That you neither convince one another<br/> nor came to be convinced yourselves,<br/> that you neither win one another over<br/> nor are won over yourselves?"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[384]</b></span> "Yes, Lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, monks?</p>

    <p class="f4">At the time when you,<br/> disputatious,<br/> quarrelsome,<br/> contentious,<br/> live wounding one another<br/> with the weapon of the tongue,<br/> is a friendly act of body<span class="f3"><sup>5</sup></span> offered<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> your fellow Brahma-farers,<br/> both in public and in private?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is a friendly act of speech offered your fellow Brahma-farers,<br/> both in public and in private?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is a friendly act of thought offered your fellow Brahma-farers,<br/> both in public and in private?</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, Lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then it is to be said, monks,<br/> that at that time when you,<br/> disputatious,<br/> quarrelsome,<br/> contentious,<br/> live wounding one another<br/> with the weapons of the tongue -<br/> at that time no friendly act of body is offered your fellow Brahma-farers,<br/> both in public and in private<br/> no friendly act of speech is offered your fellow Brahma-farers,<br/> both in public and in private<br/> no friendly act of thought<br/> is offered your fellow Brahma-farers,<br/> either in public or in private.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, knowing what,<br/> seeing what,<br/> is it that you,<br/> foolish men,<br/> disputatious,<br/> quarrelsome,<br/> contentious,<br/> live wounding one another<br/> with the weapons of the tongue?</p>

    <p class="f4">You neither convince one another<br/> nor are convinced yourselves,<br/> neither do you win one another over<br/> nor are won over yourselves.</p>

    <p class="f4">So this, foolish men,<br/> will be for a long time<br/> for your woe and sorrow."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these six things<br/> are to be remembered;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> making for affection,<br/> making for respect,<br/> they conduce to concord,<br/> to lack of contention,<br/> to harmony<br/> and unity.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk should offer his fellow Brahma-farers<br/> a friendly act of body<br/> both in public and in private.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is a thing to be remembered,<br/> making for affection,<br/> making for respect,<br/> which conduces to concord,<br/> to lack of contention,<br/> harmony<br/> and unity.</p>

    <p class="f4">This too is a thing to be remembered,<br/> making for affection,<br/> making for respect,<br/> which conduces to concord,<br/> to lack of contention,<br/> harmony<br/> and unity.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And again, monks,<br/> whatever those moral habits that are faultless,<br/> without flaw,<br/> spotless,<br/> without blemish,<br/> freeing,<br/> praised by wise men,<br/> untarnished,<br/> conducive to concentration -<br/> a monk should dwell united in virtues such as <span class="f2 g"><b>[385]</b></span> these<br/> with his fellow Brahma-farers,<br/> both in public and in private.</p>

    <p class="f4">This too is a thing to be remembered,<br/> making for affection,<br/> making for respect,<br/> which conduces to concord,<br/> to lack of contention,<br/> harmony<br/> and unity.</p>

    <p class="f4">And again, monks,<br/> whatever view is ariyan,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> leading onwards,<br/> leading him who acts according to it<br/> to the complete destruction of anguish -<br/> a monk should dwell united in a view such as this<br/> with his fellow Brahma-farers,<br/> both in public and in private.</p>

    <p class="f4">This too is a thing to be remembered,<br/> making for affection,<br/> making for respect,<br/> which conduces to concord,<br/> to lack of contention,<br/> harmony<br/> and unity.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these are the six things to be remembered,<br/> making for affection,<br/> making for respect,<br/> which conduce to concord,<br/> to lack of contention,<br/> to harmony and unity.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And, monks,<br/> of these six things to be remembered,<br/> this is the topmost,<br/> this the roof-plate,<br/> this the dome,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/> that is to say<br/> whatever view is ariyan,<br/> leading onwards,<br/> leading him who acts according to it<br/> to the complete destruction of anguish.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is that view<br/> which is ariyan,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> leading onwards,<br/> and which leads him who acts according to it<br/> to the complete destruction of anguish?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks,<br/> a monk who is forest-gone<br/> or gone to the root of a tree<br/> or gone to an empty place,<br/> reflects like this;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, have I a subjective obsession,<br/> not got rid of,<br/> owing to which I,<br/> if my mind were obsessed by it,<br/> could not know,<br/> could not see<br/> (things) as they really are?</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a monk is obsessed<br/> by addiction to sense-pleasures,<br/> to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a monk is obsessed<br/> by malevolence,<br/> to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a monk is obsessed<br/> by sloth and torpor,<br/> to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a monk is obsessed<br/> by restlessness and worry,<br/> to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a monk is obsessed<br/> by doubt, to this extent is his mind obsessed,<br/> to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a monk centres his thought<br/> on this world,<br/> to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a monk centres his thought<br/> on the world beyond,<br/> to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a monk, disputatious,<br/> quarrelsome,<br/> contentious,<br/> lives wounding with the weapons of his tongue,<br/> to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the first knowledge won by him,<br/> ariyan,<br/> transcendental,<br/> not in common with average men.</p>

    <p class="f4">And again, monks,<br/> the ariyan disciple reflects thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">And again, monks,<br/> an ariyan disciple reflects thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is there another recluse or brahman -<br/> outside here -<br/> who is possessed of a view<br/> such as I am possessed of?'</p>

    <p class="f4">He comprehends thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is no other recluse or brahman -<br/> outside here -<br/> who is possessed of a view<br/> such as I am possessed of.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what kind of propriety, monks,<br/> is a man possessed of<br/> who is endowed with (right) view?</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as a cow with a young calf,<br/> while she is pulling the grass<br/> keeps an eye on the calf -<br/> even so, monks, this is propriety<br/> for a man endowed with (right) view:</p>
