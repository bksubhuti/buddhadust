    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[388]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"At one time I, monks, was staying at Ukkaṭṭhā<br/> in the Subhaga Grove<br/> near the great sāl-tree.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">At that time, monks,<br/> an evil wrong view<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> came to have accrued to Baka the Brahmā<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> like this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is permanent,<br/> this is stable,<br/> this is eternal,<br/> this is entire,<br/> this is not liable to passing away,<br/> this is not born,<br/> does not age,<br/> does not die,<br/> does not pass away,<br/> does not uprise,<br/> and there is not another further escape from this.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then did I, monks,<br/> knowing with my mind<br/> the reasoning in the mind of Baka the Brahmā,<br/> as a <span class="f2 g"><b>[389]</b></span> strong man might bend back his outstretched arm<br/> or might stretch out his bent arm,<br/> so, vanishing from near the great sāl-tree<br/> in the Subhaga Grove at Ukkaṭṭhā,<br/> did I appear in that Brahma-world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, Baka the Brahmā saw me coming in the distance;<br/> seeing me, he spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, good sir,<br/> you are welcome, good sir.</p>

    <p class="f4">At last, good sir,<br/> you make this occasion for coming here.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But this, good sir, is permanent,<br/> this is stable,<br/> this is eternal,<br/> this is entire,<br/> this is not liable to passing away,<br/> this is not born,<br/> nor does it age<br/> or die<br/> or pass away<br/> or uprise,<br/> and there is not another further escape from this.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/> I, monks, spoke thus to Baka the Brahma:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed, Baka the Brahma is steeped in ignorance,<br/> indeed, Baka the Brahma is steeped in ignorance,<br/> inasmuch as he says</p>

    <p class="f4">"permanent"<br/> although it is indeed impermanent,<br/> "stable"<br/> although it is indeed unstable,<br/> "eternal"<br/> although it is indeed not eternal,<br/> "entire"<br/> although it is indeed not entire,<br/> "not liable to passing away"<br/> although it is indeed liable to passing away,<br/> and because in regard to what is born,<br/> and ages<br/> and dies<br/> and passes away<br/> and uprises,<br/> he says:<br/> "This is not born,<br/> nor does it age<br/> or die<br/> or pass away<br/> or uprise,"<br/> and although there is another further escape,<br/> he says:<br/> "There is not another further escape."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, Māra the Evil One,<br/> having entered a certain company of Brahmas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> spoke thus to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Monk, monk,<br/> do not meddle with this,<br/> do not meddle with this.</p>

    <p class="f4">For, monk,<br/> this Brahmā<br/> is a Great Brahmā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> Victor,<br/> Unvanquished,<br/> All-seeing,<br/> Controller,<br/> Lord,<br/> Maker,<br/> Creator,<br/> Chief,<br/> Disposer,<br/> Master,<br/> Father of all that have become<br/> and will be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you<br/> who scorned extension,<br/> loathed extension,<br/> who scorned cohesion,<br/> loathed cohesion,<br/> who scorned heat,<br/> loathed heat,<br/> who scorned motion,<br/> loathed motion,<br/> who scorned creatures,<br/> loathed creatures,<br/> who scorned devas,<br/> loathed devas,<br/> who scorned Pajāpati,<br/> loathed Pajāpati,<br/> who scorned Brahmā,<br/> loathed Brahmā<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> -<br/> these at the breaking up of the body,<br/> at the Cutting off of life,<br/> were established in a low group.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But, monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you, <span class="f2 g"><b>[390]</b></span> who lauded extension,<br/> delighted in extension,<br/> who lauded cohesion,<br/> delighted in cohesion,<br/> who lauded heat,<br/> delighted in heat,<br/> who lauded motion,<br/> delighted in motion,<br/> who lauded creatures,<br/> delighted in creatures,<br/> who lauded devas,<br/> delighted in devas,<br/> who lauded Pajāpati,<br/> delighted in Pajāpati,<br/> who lauded Brahmā,<br/> delighted in Brahmā -<br/> these at the breaking up of the body,<br/> at the cutting off of life,<br/> were established in an excellent group.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">On account of this do I, monk, speak thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Please do you, good sir,<br/> do exactly what Brahmā says to you,<br/> do not go beyond Brahmā's word.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you, monk, should go beyond Brahmā's word,<br/> it will be with you, monk,<br/> as with a man who might beat back approaching glory<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> with a stick,<br/> or, monk, as with a man who might miss<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> the earth<br/> with his hands and feet<br/> as he was falling down hell's precipices.</p>

    <p class="f4">Please do you, good sir,<br/> do exactly what Brahmā says to you,<br/> do not go beyond Brahmā's word.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not you, monk,<br/> see the seated company of Brahmā?"'</p>

    <p class="f4">And so, monks, Māra the Evil One<br/> conducted me to the company of Brahmā.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had spoken thus,<br/> I, monks, spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, Evil One, know you;<br/> do not think that I do not know you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Māra, you are the Evil One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And whoever, Evil One,<br/> is a Brahmā,<br/> and whatever are Brahmā-companies,<br/> and whatever are Brahmā-conclaves,<br/> all are in your grasp,<br/> all are in your power.</p>

    <p class="f4">It occurs to you thus, Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let this one too be in my grasp,<br/> let this one too be in my power.</p>

    <p class="f4">But I, Evil One, am not in your grasp,<br/> I am not in your power.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When I had said this, monks,<br/> Baka the Brahmā spoke thus to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'But I, good sir, say "permanent"<br/> because it is permanent,<br/> I say "stable"<br/> because it is stable,<br/> I say "eternal"<br/> because it is eternal,<br/> I say "entire"<br/> because it is entire,<br/> I say "not liable to passing away"<br/> because it is not liable to passing away,<br/> and of what is not born,<br/> does not age,<br/> die,<br/> pass away<br/> and uprise,<br/> this is just what I say:<br/> "This is not born,<br/> it does not age,<br/> it does not die,<br/> it does not pass away,<br/> it does not uprise;"<br/> and because there is not another further escape,<br/> I say, "There is not another further escape."</p>

    <p class="f4">There were, monk, recluses and brahmans in the world before you<br/> who practised austerities<br/> for a term as long as your whole life.</p>

    <p class="f4">These would know thus:<br/> either, if there is another further escape:<br/> There is another further escape;<br/> or, if there is not another further escape:<br/> There is not another further escape.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, monk, say this to you:</p>

    <p class="f4">You will never see another further escape<br/> however <span class="f2 g"><b>[391]</b></span> much yon may go in for toil and trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4">But if you, monk, would ascertain<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> extension,<br/> you will become near to me,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/> reposing on my substance,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/> to be done to as I will,<br/> dwarfed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">If you would ascertain cohesion,<br/> you will become near to me,<br/> reposing on my substance,<br/> to be done to as I will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you would ascertain heat,<br/> you will become near to me,<br/> reposing on my substance,<br/> to be done to as I will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you would ascertain motion,<br/> you will become near to me,<br/> reposing on my substance,<br/> to be done to as I will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you would ascertain creatures,<br/> you will become near to me,<br/> reposing on my substance,<br/> to be done to as I will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you would ascertain <i>devas,</i><br/> you will become near to me,<br/> reposing on my substance,<br/> to be done to as I will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you would ascertain Pajāpati,<br/> you will become near to me,<br/> reposing on my substance,<br/> to be done to as I will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you would ascertain Brahmā,<br/> you will become near to me,<br/> reposing on my substance,<br/> to be done to as I will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">'But I too, Brahma, know this:</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were to ascertain extension,<br/> I will become near to you,<br/> reposing on your substance,<br/> to be done to as you will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were to ascertain cohesion,<br/> I will become near to you,<br/> reposing on your substance,<br/> to be done to as you will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were to ascertain heat,<br/> I will become near to you,<br/> reposing on your substance,<br/> to be done to as you will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were to ascertain motion,<br/> I will become near to you,<br/> reposing on your substance,<br/> to be done to as you will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were to ascertain creatures,<br/> I will become near to you,<br/> reposing on your substance,<br/> to be done to as you will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were to ascertain <i>devas,</i><br/> I will become near to you,<br/> reposing on your substance,<br/> to be done to as you will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were to ascertain Pajāpati,<br/> I will become near to you,<br/> reposing on your substance,<br/> to be done to as you will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were to ascertain Brahmā,<br/> I will become near to you,<br/> reposing on your substance,<br/> to be done to as you will,<br/> dwarfed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover I both comprehend your bourn, Brahmā,<br/> and I comprehend your splendour:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Baka the Brahma is of great psychic power thus,<br/> Baka the Brahma is of great majesty thus,<br/> Baka the Brahma is of great fame thus.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">As far as moon and sun revolve in their course<br/> And light up all the quarters with their radiance,<br/> So far extends the thousand-world system:<br/> Here your sway is exercised.<br/> But do you know the distinctions?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span><br/> The passionate and dispassionate likewise?<br/> The becoming thus, the becoming otherwise,<br/> The coming and the going of beings?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It is thus that I, Brahmā,<br/> both comprehend your bourn<br/> and comprehend your splendour:<br/> Baka the Brahma is of great psychic power thus,<br/> Baka the Brahma is of great majesty thus,<br/> Baka the Brahma is of great fame thus.</p>

    <p class="f4">But there are, Brahmā,<br/> three other classes<br/> which you do not know,<br/> do not see,<br/> but which I know and see.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, Brahmā,<br/> the class called Radiant ones<br/> from which you have passed away,<br/> uprising here;<br/> but because of your very long abiding<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span> (here),<br/> the recollection of it is confused,<br/> and <span class="f2 g"><b>[392]</b></span> because of that<br/> you neither know nor see it;<br/> I know and see it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus I, Brahmā, am not merely on an exact equality with you<br/> as regards super-knowledge;<br/> how could I be lower,<br/> since I am indeed greater than you?</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā<br/> and Brahmā's company<br/> and Brahmā's conclave<br/> were filled with wonder and amazement,<br/> and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Wonderful, good sirs,<br/> marvellous, good sirs,<br/> is the great psychic power,<br/> the great majesty<br/> of the recluse Gotama;<br/> indeed before now<br/> there has not been seen or heard<br/> another recluse or brahman<br/> of such great psychic power,<br/> of such great majesty<br/> as this recluse Gotama,<br/> a son of the Sakyans,<br/> gone forth from a Sakyan family.</p>

    <p class="f4">For a people delighting in becoming,<br/> delighted with becoming,<br/> revelling in becoming,<br/> he has indeed pulled up becoming<br/> with its root.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, Māra the Evil One,<br/> having entered a certain Brahma-conclave,<br/> spoke thus to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'If you, good sir, know thus,<br/> if you have understood<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a></sup></span> thus,<br/> do not communicate it to disciples<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a></sup></span><br/> or to those who have gone forth;<br/> do not teach <i>Dhamma</i> to disciples<br/> or to those who have gone forth;<br/> do not crave for disciples<br/> or for those who have gone forth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you,<br/> claiming to be perfected ones,<br/> fully self-awakened ones;<br/> these communicated to disciples<br/> and to those who had gone forth;<br/> they taught <i>Dhamma</i> to disciples<br/> and to those who had gone forth;<br/> they craved for disciples<br/> and for those <span class="f2 g"><b>[394]</b></span> who had gone forth.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, having communicated to disciples<br/> and to those who had gone forth,<br/> having taught <i>Dhamma</i> to disciples<br/> and to those who had gone forth,<br/> having craved for disciples<br/> and for those who had gone forth,<br/> at the breaking up of the body,<br/> at the cutting off of life,<br/> were established in a low group.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you,<br/> claiming to be perfected ones,<br/> fully self-awakened ones;<br/> these did not communicate to disciples<br/> or to those who had gone forth;<br/> they did not teach <i>Dhamma</i> to disciples<br/> or to those who had gone forth;<br/> they did not crave for disciples<br/> or for those who had gone forth.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, not having communicated to disciples<br/> or to those who had gone forth,<br/> not having taught <i>Dhamma</i> to disciples<br/> or to those who had gone forth,<br/> not having craved for disciples<br/> or for those who had gone forth,<br/> at the breaking up of the body,<br/> at the cutting off of life,<br/> were established in an excellent group.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">So I speak thus to you, monk:</p>

    <p class="f4">Please do you, good sir,<br/> dwell untroubled<br/> and intent on abiding in ease here and now.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What is skill<br/> is not pointing out,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a></sup></span> good sir,<br/> so do not instruct others.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said, I, monks,<br/> spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know you, Evil One,<br/> do not think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He does not know me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Evil One, you are Māra.</p>

    <p class="f4">You do not speak to me thus, Evil One,<br/> because you are friendly<br/> and compassionate;<br/> you speak to me thus, Evil One,<br/> because you are not friendly,<br/> not compassionate.</p>

    <p class="f4">And you think thus, Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">Those to whom the recluse Gotama teaches <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> will get beyond my reach.</p>

    <p class="f4">Although those recluses and brahmans, Evil One,<br/> who claimed:</p>

    <p class="f4">"We are fully self-awakened ones,"</p>

    <p class="f4">were not fully self-awakened ones,<br/> nevertheless I, Evil One,<br/> who claim:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am a fully self-awakened one,"</p>

    <p class="f4">am indeed a fully self-awakened one.</p>

    <p class="f4">For, Evil One,<br/> whether a Tathāgata is teaching <i>Dhamma</i> to disciples,<br/> he is such a one;<br/> whether, Evil One,<br/> a <i>Tathāgata</i> is not teaching <i>Dhamma</i> to disciples,<br/> he is such a one;<br/> whether, Evil One,<br/> a <i>Tathāgata</i> is communicating it to disciples,<br/> he is such a one;<br/> whether, Evil One,<br/> a Tathāgata is not communicating it to disciples,<br/> he is such a one.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Evil One, in a <i>Tathāgata</i><br/> those cankers which are connected with the defilements,<br/> with again-becoming,<br/> fearful,<br/> whose results are anguish,<br/> which make for birth,<br/> ageing and dying <span class="f2 g"><b>[395]</b></span> in the future,<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> cut off at the root,<br/> made like a palm-tree stump<br/> so that they can come to no further existence in the future.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Evil One,<br/> as a palm-tree whose crown has been cut off<br/> cannot put forth growth again,<br/> even so, Evil One,<br/> in a Tathāgata those cankers which are connected with the defilements,<br/> with again-becoming,<br/> fearful,<br/> whose results are anguish,<br/> which make for birth,<br/> ageing and dying in the future,<br/> these are got rid of,<br/> cut off at the root,<br/> made like a palm-tree stump<br/> that can come to no further existence in the future.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of Māra's failure to persuade (me)<br/> and because of the invitation to a Brahmā,<br/> a synonym for this homily is therefore<br/> A challenge to a Brahmā."</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr">Discourse on a Challenge to a Brahma:<br/> the Ninth</p>
