    <h2>Māra Tajjaniya Sutta</h2>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[395]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">T<span class="f3">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying among the Bhaggas in Sumsumāragira<br/> in Bhesakaḷā Grove in the deer-park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Moggallāna the Great was pacing up and down in the open.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time Māra the Evil One,<br/> entering the venerable Moggallāna the Great's belly,<br/> got into his stomach.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now why is my belly heavy as if it were heaped full?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great, having come down from the place for pacing up and down in,<br/> having entered the dwelling-place,<br/> sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down,<br/> the venerable Moggallāna the Great reflected carefully about himself.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great saw that Māra the Evil One,<br/> having entered his belly,<br/> had got into his stomach;<br/> seeing him, he spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Get out, Evil One;<br/> Evil One, get out;<br/> do not annoy a Tathāgata<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[396]</b></span> or a Tathāgata's disciple,<br/> lest for a long time there be woe and sorrow for you."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This recluse speaks thus not even knowing,<br/> not even seeing me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Get out, Evil One,<br/> Evil One, get out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not annoy a Tathāgata or a Tathāgata's disciple,<br/> lest for a long time there be woe and sorrow for you.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Even his teacher could not know me so quickly,<br/> so how can this disciple know me?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"But I do know you, Evil One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not you think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He does not know me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">You, Evil One, are Māra.</p>

    <p class="f4">It occurred to you, Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This recluse speaks thus not even knowing,<br/> not even seeing me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Get out, Evil One,<br/> Evil One, get out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not annoy a Tathāgata or a Tathāgata's disciple,<br/> lest for a long time there be woe and sorrow for you.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Even his teacher could not know me so quickly,<br/> so how can this disciple know me?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is because this recluse knows and sees me that he speaks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Get out, Evil One,<br/> Evil One, get out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not annoy a Tathāgata or a Tathāgata's disciple,<br/> lest for a long time there be woe and sorrow for you.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Māra the Evil One, having gone out through the venerable Moggallāna the Great's mouth,<br/> stood against the door.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great saw<br/> Māra the Evil One<br/> standing against the door;<br/> seeing him,<br/> he spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed I do see you now, Evil One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He does not see me';</p>

    <p class="f4">it is you, Evil One,<br/> standing against the door.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, I, Evil One,<br/> was the Māra called Dūsin;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> as such Kāḷi was the name of my sister,<br/> you were her son,<br/> thus you were my nephew.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time, Evil One, Kakusandha,<br/> the Lord,<br/> the perfected one,<br/> fully self-awakened one,<br/> had uprisen in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Evil One, Vidhura and Sañjīva were the pair of disciples which was the chief,<br/> the lucky pair of Kakusandha,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> the Lord,<br/> the perfected one,<br/> the fully self-awakened one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of all the disciples, Evil One,<br/> of Kakusandha,<br/> the Lord,<br/> perfected one,<br/> fully self-awakened one,<br/> there was none there equal to the venerable Vidhura<br/> in regard to teaching <i>Dhamma</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">It was because of this, <span class="f2 g"><b>[397]</b></span> Evil One,<br/> that the venerable Vidhura's name came to be Vidhura, the Peerless.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the venerable Sañjīva, Evil One,<br/> forest-gone,<br/> gone to the roots of trees<br/> and gone to empty places,<br/> with no trouble<br/> attained the stopping of perceiving and feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, Evil One, the venerable Sañjīva was sitting at the root of a certain tree<br/> attaining the stopping of perceiving and feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, cowherds, goatherds, yeoman farmers, travellers,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> saw the venerable Sañjīva sitting at the root of that tree<br/> attaining the stopping of perceiving and feeling;<br/> having seen him,<br/> it occurred to them:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed it is wonderful,<br/> indeed it is marvellous,<br/> that this recluse is just sitting dead.</p>

    <p class="f4">Come, we will cremate him.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, these cowherds, goatherds, yeomen farmers, travellers,<br/> having collected grass and sticks and cow-dung<br/> and having heaped them over the venerable Sañjīva's body,<br/> lit the fire and departed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, the venerable Sañjīva,<br/> having emerged towards the end of that night<br/> from that attainment,<br/> having shaken his robes,<br/> having dressed in the morning,<br/> taking his bowl and robe,<br/> entered a village for almsfood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Evil One, those cowherds, goatherds, yeomen farmers and travellers<br/> saw the venerable Sañjīva walking for almsfood;<br/> having seen him,<br/> it occurred to them:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed it is wonderful,<br/> indeed it is marvellous<br/> that this recluse who was just sitting dead -<br/> that he has come back to life.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It was because of this, Evil One,<br/> that the venerable Sañjīva's name<br/> came to be Sañjīva, the Quick.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, it occurred to the Māra Dūsin:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I simply do not know<br/> either the coming or the going<br/> of these monks who are of moral habit,<br/> lovely in character.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to visit brahmans and householders (and say):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come, do you revile, abuse, vex, annoy<br/> the monks who are of good moral habit,<br/> lovely in character,<br/> for it is likely<br/> that when they are being reviled, abused, vexed and annoyed by you<br/> there will be a change of heart<br/> so that Dūsin the Māra might get a chance over them."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Then, Evil One, the Māra Dūsin visited brahmans and householders (and said):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come, do you revile, abuse, vex, annoy<br/> the monks who are of good moral habit,<br/> lovely in character,<br/> for it is likely<br/> that when they are being reviled, abused, vexed and annoyed by you<br/> there will be a change of heart<br/> so that Dūsin the Māra might get a chance over them."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, those brahmans and householders<br/> who had been visited by the Māra Dūsin<br/> reviled, abused, vexed and annoyed<br/> the monks who were of good moral habit,<br/> lovely in character, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'But these little shaveling recluses are menials,<br/> black,<br/> the offscourings of our kins- <span class="f2 g"><b>[398]</b></span> man's feet.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">They say,</p>

    <p class="f4">"We are meditatives,<br/> we are meditatives",</p>

    <p class="f4">and with their shoulders drooping,<br/> with their faces cast down,<br/> as if drugged,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> they meditate,<br/> they meditate absorbed,<br/> they meditate more absorbed,<br/> they meditate quite absorbed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">As an owl<br/> on the branch of a tree<br/> when tracking a mouse<br/> meditates,<br/> meditates absorbed,<br/> meditates more absorbed,<br/> meditates quite absorbed,<br/> so do these little shaveling recluses,<br/> menials,<br/> black the offscourings of our kinsman's feet<br/> meditate quite absorbed.</p>

    <p class="f4">And as a jackal<br/> on the bank of a river<br/> when tracking fish<br/> meditates,<br/> meditates absorbed,<br/> meditates more absorbed,<br/> meditates quite absorbed,<br/> so do these little shaveling recluses,<br/> menials,<br/> black the offscourings of our kinsman's feet<br/> meditate quite absorbed.</p>

    <p class="f4">And as a cat<br/> on the edge of a refuse heap<br/> when tracking a mouse<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> meditates,<br/> meditates absorbed,<br/> meditates more absorbed,<br/> meditates quite absorbed,<br/> so do these little shaveling recluses,<br/> menials,<br/> black the offscourings of our kinsman's feet<br/> meditate quite absorbed.</p>

    <p class="f4">And as an ass<br/> at the edge of a refuse-heap,<br/> its burden removed,<br/> meditates,<br/> meditates absorbed,<br/> meditates more absorbed,<br/> meditates quite absorbed,<br/> so do these little shaveling recluses,<br/> menials,<br/> black,<br/> the offscourings of our kinsman's feet,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'We are meditatives,<br/> we are meditatives,'</p>

    <p class="f4">with their shoulders drooping,<br/> with their faces cast down,<br/> as if drugged,<br/> meditate,<br/> meditate absorbed,<br/> meditate more absorbed,<br/> meditate quite absorbed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Evil One, nearly all the people<br/> who passed away at that time,<br/> at the breaking up of the body after dying<br/> arose in a sorrowful state,<br/> a bad bourn,<br/> the abyss,<br/> Niraya Hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, Kakusandha,<br/> the Lord,<br/> perfected one,<br/> fully self-awakened one,<br/> addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks,<br/> brahmans and householders have been visited by the Māra Dūsin (who said):</p>

    <p class="f4">Come, do you, monks, abide,<br/> having suffused the first quarter with a mind of friendliness,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> like wise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> abide having suffused the whole world,<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way<br/> with a mind of friendliness,<br/> that is far-reaching,<br/> widespread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abide, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of compassion,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> like wise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> abide having suffused the whole world,<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way<br/> with a mind of friendliness,<br/> that is far-reaching,<br/> widespread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abide, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of sympathetic joy,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> like wise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> abide having suffused the whole world,<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way<br/> with a mind of friendliness,<br/> that is far-reaching,<br/> widespread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, these monks,<br/> forest-gone<br/> and gone to the roots of trees<br/> and gone to empty places,<br/> thus exhorted,<br/> thus instructed by Kakusandha,<br/> the Lord,<br/> perfected one,<br/> fully self-awakened one,<br/> abided, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of friendliness,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> like wise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> abide having suffused the whole world,<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way<br/> with a mind of friendliness,<br/> that is far-reaching,<br/> widespread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, it occurred to the Māra Dūsin:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even although I am working thus,<br/> I do not know the coming<br/> or the going<br/> of these monks who are of good moral habit,<br/> lovely in character.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, the Māra Dūsin visited these brahmans and householders (and said):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come, do you reverence,<br/> revere,<br/> respect,<br/> honour the monks who are of good moral habit,<br/> lovely in character,<br/> for it is likely that when they are being reverenced,<br/> revered,<br/> respected<br/> and honoured by you,<br/> there will be <span class="f2 g"><b>[400]</b></span> a change of heart,<br/> so that Dūsin the Māra can get a chance over them."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, these brahmans and householders who had been visited by Dūsin the Māra,<br/> reverenced,<br/> revered,<br/> respected<br/> and honoured those monks<br/> who were of good moral habit,<br/> lovely in character.</p>

    <p class="f4">Evil One, nearly all the people<br/> who passed away at that time,<br/> at the breaking up of the body after dying<br/> arose in a good bourn,<br/> a heaven world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, Kakusandha,<br/> the Lord,<br/> perfected one,<br/> fully self-awakened one,<br/> addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, brahmans and householders have been visited by the Māra Dūsin (who said):</p>

    <p class="f4">Come, do you, monks,<br/> dwell beholding what is unlovely in the body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/> conscious of the cloying of food,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/> conscious of there being no delight in the whole world,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/> beholding<span class="f3"><sup>14</sup></span> the impermanence of all constructions.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, these monks,<br/> forest-gone,<br/> gone to the roots of trees<br/> and gone to empty places,<br/> being exhorted thus,<br/> being instructed thus by Kakusandha,<br/> the Lord,<br/> perfected one,<br/> fully self-awakened one,<br/> dwelt beholding what is unlovely in the body,<br/> conscious of the cloying of food,<br/> conscious of there being no delight in the whole world,<br/> beholding the impermanence of all constructions.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, Kakusandha,<br/> the Lord,<br/> perfected one,<br/> fully self-awakened one,<br/> having dressed in the morning,<br/> taking his bowl and robe,<br/> entered a village for almsfood<br/> with the venerable Vidhura as his attendant.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, Dūsin the Māra,<br/> having visited a certain young man,<br/> having taken up a stone,<br/> gave a blow to the venerable Vidhura's head;<br/> his head split.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, the venerable Vidhura<br/> with his head broken<br/> and dripping with blood, -<br/> even so followed close after Kakusandha,<br/> the Lord,<br/> the perfected one,<br/> fully self-awakened one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, Kakusandha,<br/> the Lord,<br/> perfected one,<br/> fully self-awakened one,<br/> looked around with the "elephant-look."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span> and thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed, this Dūsin the Māra does not know moderation."</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was looking <span class="f2 g"><b>[401]</b></span> around, Evil One, Dūsin the Māra deceased from that place<br/> and arose in the Great Niraya Hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">Evil One, there are three appellations of that Great Niraya Hell:</p>

    <p class="f4">it is called<br/> "Belonging to the sphere of the Six Sensory Impingements"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span><br/> and it is called<br/> "The Meeting of the Spikes"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span><br/> and it is called<br/> "The Separate Feelings."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, the guardian of Niraya Hell,<br/> having approached me, spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'When, good sir, spike shall meet spike within your heart,<br/> then you should understand this:</p>

    <p class="f4">There will be a thousand years<br/> of boiling in Niraya Hell for me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I, Evil One, for many years,<br/> for many a hundred,<br/> for many a thousand years,<br/> boiled in that Great Niraya Hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">After ten thousand years<br/> of that Great Niraya Hell itself,<br/> feeling a feeling called <i>vuṭṭhānima</i> (pain),<br/> I was boiled in Ussada (Hell).</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of this, Evil One,<br/> my body came to be such, like a man's;<br/> my head came to be such, like a fish's."</p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span>What was that Niraya Hell like where Dūsin was boiled<br/> For striking the disciple Vidhura and the brahman<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span> Kakusandha?</p>
