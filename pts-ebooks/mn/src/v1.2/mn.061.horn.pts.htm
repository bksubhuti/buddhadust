    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[414]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/> in the Bamboo Grove<br/> at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time the venerable Rāhula<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> was staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/> emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br/> approached Ambalaṭṭhikā.<br/> and the venerable Rāhula.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Rāhula saw the Lord coming in the distance;<br/> seeing him,<br/> he made ready a seat<br/> and water for (washing) the feet.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord sat down on the seat made ready;<br/> as he was sitting down<br/> he bathed his feet.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Rāhula,<br/> having greeted the Lord,<br/> sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/> having put a little quantity of water<br/> that was left over<br/> into a water-vessel,<br/> addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula,<br/> see this little quantity of water<br/> that is left over<br/> and that is put into the water-vessel?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/> little is the recluseship<br/> of those who have no shame at intentional lying."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/> having thrown away that little quantity of water,<br/> addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula,<br/> see this little quantity of water<br/> that has been thrown away?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/> thrown away is the recluseship<br/> of those who have no shame at intentional lying."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/> having overturned that water-vessel,<br/> addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula, see this water-vessel<br/> that has been overturned?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/> overturned is the recluseship<br/> of those who have no shame at intentional lying."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/> having turned upright that water-vessel,<br/> addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula,<br/> see this water-vessel that is empty,<br/> void?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/> void and empty is the recluseship<br/> of those who have no shame at intentional lying.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rāhula, it is like<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> a king's bull-elephant<br/> whose tusks are as long as a plough-pole,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> massive,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> finely bred,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> whose home is the battle-field,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> and who, when going forth to battle,<br/> uses<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> his forelegs,<br/> uses his hindlegs,<br/> uses the forepart of his body,<br/> uses the hindpart of his body,<br/> uses his head,<br/> uses his ears,<br/> uses his tusks<br/> and uses his tail,<br/> <span class="f2">[415]</span> protecting only his trunk.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon it occurs to the mahout:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This king's bull-elephant<br/> whose tusks are as long as a plough-pole<br/> massive,<br/> finely bred,<br/> whose home is the battle-field,<br/> and who, when going forth to battle,<br/> uses his forelegs,<br/> uses his hindlegs,<br/> uses the forepart of his body,<br/> uses the hindpart of his body,<br/> uses his head,<br/> uses his ears,<br/> uses his tusks<br/> and uses his tail,<br/> protects only his trunk.</p>

    <p class="f4">This king's bull-elephant<br/> has not thrown away his life.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But when, Rāhula,<br/> the king's bull-elephant<br/> whose tusks are as long as a plough-pole<br/> massive,<br/> finely bred,<br/> whose home is the battle-field,<br/> and who, when going forth to battle,<br/> uses his forelegs,<br/> uses his hindlegs,<br/> uses the forepart of his body,<br/> uses the hindpart of his body,<br/> uses his head,<br/> uses his ears,<br/> uses his tusks<br/> and uses his tail,<br/> and uses his trunk,<br/> it thereupon occurs to the mahout:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This king's bull-elephant<br/> whose tusks are as long as a plough-pole<br/> massive,<br/> finely bred,<br/> whose home is the battle-field,<br/> and who, when going forth to battle,<br/> uses his forelegs,<br/> uses his hindlegs,<br/> uses the forepart of his body,<br/> uses the hindpart of his body,<br/> uses his head,<br/> uses his ears,<br/> uses his tusks<br/> and uses his tail,<br/> and uses his trunk.</p>

    <p class="f4">This king's bull-elephant<br/> has thrown away his life,<br/> there is nothing to be done now<br/> for the king's bull-elephant.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, Rāhula,<br/> of anyone for whom there is no shame at intentional lying,<br/> of him I say<br/> that there is no evil he cannot do.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, for you, Rāhula,</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will not speak a lie,<br/> even for fun'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> -</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Rāhula?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the purpose of a mirror?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Its purpose is reflection, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/> a deed is to be done with the body<br/> (only) after <span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span> repeated reflection;<br/> a deed is to be done with speech<br/> (only) after repeated reflection<br/> a deed is to be done with the mind<br/> (only) after repeated reflection.</p>
