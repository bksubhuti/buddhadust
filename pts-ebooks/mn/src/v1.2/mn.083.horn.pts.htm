    <h2>Makhādeva Sutta</h2>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[267]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Mithilā<br/> in Makhādeva's Mango Grove.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord smiled (when he <span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span> came to a) certain place.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is the cause,<br/> what the reason<br/> that the Lord is smiling?</p>

    <p class="f4">Not without motive<br/> do Tathāgatas smile."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br/> having arranged his robe over one shoulder,<br/> having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br/> spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, revered sir, what is the cause,<br/> what the reason<br/> that the Lord is smiling?</p>

    <p class="f4">Not without motive<br/> do Tathāgatas smile."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Once upon a time, Ānanda,<br/> in this very Mithilā<br/> there was a king named Makhādeva,<br/> a <i>Dhamma</i>-man,<br/> a king under <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> firm in <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> a great king who fared by <i>Dhamma</i><br/> among brahmans and householders,<br/> townsfolk and countryfolk,<br/> and who observed the Observance<br/> on the fourteenth,<br/> fifteenth<br/> and eighth days<br/> of the half-month.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br/> many hundreds of years,<br/> many thousands of years,<br/> King Makhādeva addressed his barber,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'When, good barber,<br/> you see grey hairs growing on my head,<br/> then you may tell me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Ānanda, the barber answered King Makhādeva in assent,<br/> saying,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, sire.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br/> many hundreds of years,<br/> many thousands of years,<br/> the barber saw grey hairs growing<br/> on King Makhādeva's head.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seeing that, Ānanda,<br/> he spoke thus to King Makhādeva:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Death's messengers<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> have appeared to his majesty;<br/> grey hairs are to be seen growing on his head.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well then, good barber,<br/> when you have pulled out those grey hairs properly with the tweezers,<br/> place them on my fingers.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, your majesty.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And when, Ānanda, the barber had answered King Makhādeva in assent,<br/> he pulled out the grey hairs properly with the tweezers<br/> and placed them on King Makhādeva's fingers.</p>

    <p class="f4">And, Ānanda, King Makhādeva,<br/> having given the boon of a village to the barber,<br/> had the prince who was his eldest son summoned<br/> and spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Dear Prince,<br/> Death's messengers have appeared to me;<br/> grey hairs are to be seen growing on my head.</p>

    <p class="f4">Human sense-pleasures <span class="f2 g"><b>[269]</b></span> have been enjoyed by me;<br/> it is now time to seek deva-like sense-pleasures.</p>

    <p class="f4">Come you, dear Prince,<br/> rule this kingdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">For I, having cut off my hair and beard,<br/> having donned saffron garments,<br/> will go forth from home<br/> into homelessness.</p>

    <p class="f4">And now, dear Prince,<br/> when you too see grey hairs growing on your head,<br/> then, having given the boon of a village to the barber,<br/> having handed over the kingdom properly<br/> to the prince who is your eldest son,<br/> having cut off your hair and beard,<br/> having donned saffron garments,<br/> you should go forth from home<br/> into homelessness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This lovely custom<br/> founded by me<br/> you should maintain;<br/> do not you be the last man after me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dear Prince, while two persons exist<br/> and there is a breaking of such a lovely custom,<br/> whichever of these (breaks it)<br/> he is the last man.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">So I, dear Prince, speak thus to you:</p>

    <p class="f4">This lovely custom<br/> founded by me<br/> you should maintain;<br/> do not you be the last man after me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, King Makhādeva,<br/> having given the boon of the village to the barber,<br/> having handed over the kingdom properly<br/> to the prince who was his eldest son,<br/> having in this very Makhādeva Mango Grove<br/> cut off his hair and beard,<br/> having donned saffron garments,<br/> went forth from home<br/> into homelessness.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of friendliness,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> likewise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way,<br/> with a mind of friendliness<br/> that was far-reaching,<br/> wide-spread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of sympathetic joy,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> likewise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way,<br/> with a mind of sympathetic joy<br/> that was far-reaching,<br/> wide-spread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of equanimity,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> likewise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way,<br/> with a mind of equanimity<br/> that was far-reaching,<br/> wide-spread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">But, Ānanda, King Makhādeva<br/> had played at boys' sports<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> for 84,000 years,<br/> had ruled as a viceroy<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> for 84,000 years,<br/> and had ruled as a king<br/> for 84,000 years;<br/> for 84,000 years,<br/> gone forth from home into homelessness<br/> in this very Makhādeva Mango Grove,<br/> he fared the Brahma-faring.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, having developed the four Brahma-abidings,<br/> was one who at the breaking up of the body after dying<br/> reached the Brahma-world.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br/> many hundreds of years,<br/> many thousands of years,<br/> King Makhādeva's son addressed his barber,<br/> saying:</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Nimi was the last of these kings,<br/> a <i>Dhamma</i>-man,<br/> a king under <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> firm in <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> a great king who fared by <i>Dhamma</i><br/> among brahmans and householders,<br/> townsfolk and countryfolk,<br/> and who observed the Observance<br/> on the fourteenth,<br/> fifteenth<br/> and eighth days of the half-month.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, Ānanda,<br/> when the Devas of the Thirty-Three<br/> were sitting down gathered together<br/> in the Sudhammā debating hall,<br/> this chance talk arose:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed it is a gain for the Videhas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/> indeed it is well gotten by the Videhas<br/> in that their king Nimi is a <i>Dhamma</i>-man,<br/> a king under <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> firm in <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> a great king who fares by <i>Dhamma</i><br/> among brahmans and householders,<br/> townsfolk and countryfolk,<br/> and who observes the Observance<br/> on the fourteenth,<br/> fifteenth<br/> and eighth days of the half-month.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda,<br/> Sakka, the lord of devas,<br/> addressed the Devas of the Thirty-Three:<br/> saying;</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do you, good sirs,<br/> want to see King Nimi?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'We, good sir, want to see King Nimi.'</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time King Nimi,<br/> keeping an Observance day,<br/> having washed his head on that Observance day -<br/> a fifteenth day -<br/> was sitting down on an upper terrace of his palace.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda,<br/> as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm<br/> or might bend back his outstretched arm,<br/> so did Sakka, the lord of devas,<br/> disappearing from the Devas of the Thirty-Three,<br/> appear before King Nimi.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Sakka, the lord of devas,<br/> spoke thus to King Nimi:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is a gain for you, sire,<br/> it is well gotten by you, sire.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sire, the Devas of the Thirty-Three<br/> are sitting down in the Sudhammā debating hall,<br/> praising you and saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed it is a gain for the Videhas<br/> indeed it is well gotten by the Videhas<br/> in that their king Nimi is a <i>Dhamma</i>-man,<br/> a king under <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> firm in <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> a great king who fares by <i>Dhamma</i><br/> among brahmans and householders,<br/> townsfolk and countryfolk,<br/> and who observes the Observance<br/> on the fourteenth,<br/> fifteenth<br/> and eighth days of the half-month."</p>

    <p class="f4">Sire, the Devas of the Thirty-Three<br/> are anxious to see you,<br/> so I, sire, will send you a chariot<br/> harnessed <span class="f2 g"><b>[271]</b></span> with a thousand thoroughbreds;<br/> sire, you should mount the <i>deva</i>-like vehicle without hesitation.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Ānanda, King Nimi consented by becoming silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Sakka, the lord of devas,<br/> summoned the charioteer Mātali and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come you, good Mātali,<br/> having harnessed a chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds,<br/> and having approached King Nimi,<br/> speak thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This chariot,<br/> harnessed with a thousand thoroughbreds,<br/> has been sent to you by Sakka, the lord of <i>devas</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sire, you should mount the <i>deva</i>-like vehicle without hesitation."'</p>

    <p class="f4">'So be it, your honour.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And, Ānanda, Mātali the charioteer,<br/> having answered Sakka, the lord of devas, in assent,<br/> having harnessed a chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds<br/> and having approached King Nimi,<br/> spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This chariot, sire,<br/> harnessed with a thousand thoroughbreds,<br/> has been sent to you by Sakka, the lord of devas;<br/> sire, you should mount the deva-like vehicle without hesitation.</p>

    <p class="f4">And, moreover, sire,<br/> by which (route) do I conduct you<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> -<br/> that by which evil deeds<br/> undergo the ripening of evil deeds<br/> or that by which lovely deeds<br/> undergo the ripening of lovely deeds?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'Conduct me by both, Mātali.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So, Ānanda, the charioteer Mātali<br/> brought King Nimi<br/> to the Sudhammā debating hall.</p>

    <p class="f4">And, Ānanda, Sakka, the lord of devas,<br/> saw King Nimi approaching from the distance;<br/> seeing him,<br/> he spoke to King Nimi:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, sire,<br/> you are welcome, sire.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sire, the Devas of the Thirty-Three are sitting down<br/> in the Sudhammā debating hall<br/> praising you,<br/> and saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed it is a gain for the Videhas<br/> indeed it is well gotten by the Videhas<br/> in that their king Nimi is a <i>Dhamma</i>-man,<br/> a king under <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> firm in <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> a great king who fares by <i>Dhamma</i><br/> among brahmans and householders,<br/> townsfolk and countryfolk,<br/> and who observes the Observance<br/> on the fourteenth,<br/> fifteenth<br/> and eighth days of the half-month."</p>

    <p class="f4">Sire, the Devas of the Thirty-Three<br/> are anxious to see you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejoice, sire,<br/> among the Devas<br/> with a deva's majesty.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Enough, good sir;<br/> let me return to Mithilā itself<br/> where I will fare by <i>Dhamma</i><br/> among brahmans and householders,<br/> townsfolk and countryfolk<br/> and will observe the Observance<br/> on the fourteenth,<br/> fifteenth<br/> and eighth days of the half-month.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Sakka, the lord of devas,<br/> summoned the charioteer Mātali and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come you, good Mātali, having harnessed a chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds,<br/> take King Nimi back to Mithila itself.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[272]</b></span> 'So be it, your honour.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And, Ānanda, Mātali the charioteer,<br/> having answered Sakka, the lord of devas, in assent,<br/> harnessed a chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds<br/> and took King Nimi back to Mithilā itself.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there, Ānanda,<br/> King Nimi fared by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/> among brahmans and householders,<br/> townsfolk and countryfolk,<br/> and he observed the Observance<br/> on the fourteenth,<br/> fifteenth<br/> and eighth days<br/> of the half-month.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br/> many hundreds of years,<br/> many thousands of years,<br/> King Nimi addressed his barber,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'When, good barber,<br/> you see grey hairs growing on my head,<br/> then you may tell me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Ānanda, the barber answered King Nimi in assent,<br/> saying,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, sire.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br/> many hundreds of years,<br/> many thousands of years,<br/> the barber saw grey hairs growing<br/> on King Nimi's head.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seeing that, Ānanda,<br/> he spoke thus to King King Nimi:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Death's messengers have appeared to his majesty;<br/> grey hairs are to be seen growing on his head.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well then, good barber,<br/> when you have pulled out those grey hairs properly with the tweezers,<br/> place them on my fingers.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, your majesty.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And when, Ānanda, the barber had answered King Nimi in assent,<br/> he pulled out the grey hairs properly with the tweezers<br/> and placed them on King Nimi's fingers.</p>

    <p class="f4">And, Ānanda, King Nimi,<br/> having given the boon of a village to the barber,<br/> had the prince who was his eldest son summoned<br/> and spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Dear Prince,<br/> Death's messengers have appeared to me;<br/> grey hairs are to be seen growing on my head.</p>

    <p class="f4">Human sense-pleasures have been enjoyed by me;<br/> it is now time to seek deva-like sense-pleasures.</p>

    <p class="f4">Come you, dear Prince,<br/> rule this kingdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">For I, having cut off my hair and beard,<br/> having donned saffron garments,<br/> will go forth from home<br/> into homelessness.</p>

    <p class="f4">And now, dear Prince,<br/> when you too see grey hairs growing on your head,<br/> then, having given the boon of a village to the barber,<br/> having handed over the kingdom properly<br/> to the prince who is your eldest son,<br/> having cut off your hair and beard,<br/> having donned saffron garments,<br/> you should go forth from home<br/> into homelessness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This lovely custom<br/> founded by me<br/> you should maintain;<br/> do not you be the last man after me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dear Prince, while two persons exist<br/> and there is a breaking of such a lovely custom,<br/> whichever of these (breaks it)<br/> he is the last man.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, dear Prince, speak thus to you:</p>

    <p class="f4">This lovely custom<br/> founded by me<br/> you should maintain;<br/> do not you be the last man after me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, King Nimi,<br/> having given the boon of the village to the barber,<br/> having handed over the kingdom properly<br/> to the prince who was his eldest son,<br/> having in this very Makhādeva Mango Grove<br/> cut off his hair and beard,<br/> having donned saffron garments,<br/> went forth from home<br/> into homelessness.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of friendliness,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> likewise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way,<br/> with a mind of friendliness<br/> that was far-reaching,<br/> wide-spread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of compassion,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> likewise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way,<br/> with a mind of compassion<br/> that was far-reaching,<br/> wide-spread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of sympathetic joy,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> likewise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way,<br/> with a mind of sympathetic joy<br/> that was far-reaching,<br/> wide-spread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of equanimity,<br/> likewise the second,<br/> likewise the third,<br/> likewise the fourth;<br/> just so above,<br/> below,<br/> across;<br/> he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br/> everywhere,<br/> in every way,<br/> with a mind of equanimity<br/> that was far-reaching,<br/> wide-spread,<br/> immeasurable,<br/> without enmity,<br/> without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">But, Ānanda, King Nimi<br/> had played at boys' sports<br/> for 84,000 years,<br/> had ruled as a viceroy<br/> for 84,000 years,<br/> and had ruled as a king<br/> for 84,000 years;<br/> for 84,000 years,<br/> gone forth from home into homelessness<br/> in this very Makhādeva Mango Grove,<br/> he fared the Brahma-faring.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, having developed the four Brahma-abidings,<br/> was one who at the breaking up of the body after dying<br/> reached the Brahma-world.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, Ānanda, King Nimi's son was called Kaḷārajanaka.</p>

    <p class="f4">He did not go forth from home<br/> into homelessness.</p>

    <p class="f4">He broke that lovely custom;<br/> of those (who observed it)<br/> he was the last man.</p>

    <p class="f4">It may be that this occurs to you, Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">'At that time King Makhādeva<br/> by whom that lovely custom was founded<br/> was someone else.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But this, Ānanda, must not be understood thus.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, at that time, was King Makhādeva,<br/> I founded that lovely custom;<br/> the folk that came after<br/> maintained that lovely custom founded by me.</p>

    <p class="f4">But that lovely custom, Ānanda,<br/> did not conduce to turning away from,<br/> nor to dispassion,<br/> stopping,<br/> tranquillity,<br/> super-knowledge,<br/> self-awakening<br/> or nibbāna -<br/> only to reaching the Brahma-world.</p>

    <p class="f4">But this lovely custom founded by me now, Ānanda,<br/> conduces to absolute turning away from,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> stopping,<br/> tranquillity,<br/> super-knowledge,<br/> self-awakening<br/> and nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Ānanda,<br/> is the lovely custom founded by me now<br/> that conduces to absolute turning away from,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> stopping,<br/> tranquillity,<br/> super-knowledge,<br/> self-awakening<br/> and nibbāna.?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is this ariyan eightfold Way itself,<br/> that is to say,<br/> perfect view,<br/> perfect thought,<br/> perfect speech,<br/> perfect action,<br/> perfect mode of livelihood,<br/> perfect endeavour,<br/> perfect mindfulness,<br/> perfect concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is this lovely custom founded by me now, Ānanda, that conduces to absolute turning away from away from,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> stopping,<br/> tranquillity,<br/> super-knowledge,<br/> self-awakening<br/> and nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, Ānanda, speak about it thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">This lovely custom founded by me<br/> you should maintain;<br/> do not you be the last man after me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ānanda, while two persons exist<br/> and there is a breaking of such a lovely custom,<br/> whichever one of these (breaks it),<br/> he is the last man.</p>

    <p class="f4">In regard to this, I, Ānanda,<br/> speak to you thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">This lovely custom founded by me<br/> you should maintain;<br/> do not you be the last man after me."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[273]</b></span> Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Delighted, the venerable Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
