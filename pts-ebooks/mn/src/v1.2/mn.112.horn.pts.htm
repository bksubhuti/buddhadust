    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> in the Jeta Grovevin Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there<br/> the Lord addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered One,"<br/> these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, a monk here declares profound knowledge,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br/> brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br/> done is <span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span> what was to be done,<br/> there is no more of being such or so.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, the words of this monk<br/> are to be neither rejoiced in<br/> nor protested against.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Without (your) rejoicing or protesting,<br/> the question might be asked:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Your reverence,<br/> these four modes of statement<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> have been rightly pointed out<br/> by that Lord who knows and sees<br/> perfected one,<br/> fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">That which when seen<br/> is spoken of as seen,<br/> that which when heard<br/> is spoken of as heard,<br/> that which when sensed<br/> is spoken of as sensed,<br/> that which when cognised<br/> is spoken of as cognised.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Your reverence,<br/> these four modes of statement<br/> have been rightly pointed out<br/> by that Lord who knows and sees,<br/> perfected one,<br/> fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

    <p class="f4">But knowing what,<br/> seeing what<br/> in respect of these four modes of statement<br/> can your reverence say<br/> that his mind is freed from the cankers<br/> with no grasping (remaining)?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, the explanation of the monk<br/> in whom the cankers are destroyed,<br/> who has lived the life,<br/> done what was to be done,<br/> laid down the burden,<br/> attained his own welfare,<br/> in whom the fetters of becoming<br/> are utterly destroyed<br/> and who is freed<br/> by right profound knowledge,<br/> would be in accordance with <i>Dhamma</i><br/> were he to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, your reverences,<br/> not feeling attracted<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> to things seen,<br/> not feeling repelled by them,<br/> independent,<br/> not infatuated,<br/> freed,<br/> released,<br/> dwell with a mind that is unconfined.</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, your reverences,<br/> not feeling attracted to things heard,<br/> not feeling repelled by them,<br/> independent,<br/> not infatuated,<br/> freed,<br/> released,<br/> dwell with a mind that is unconfined.</p>

    <p class="f4">So, your reverences,<br/> as I know thus,<br/> see thus,<br/> in respect of these four modes of statement,<br/> I can say that my mind<br/> is freed from the cankers<br/> with no grasping (remaining).'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, that monk's words<br/> should be rejoiced in<br/> and approved of by the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">When they have rejoiced in<br/> and approved of his words,<br/> saying, 'It is good,'<br/> a further question might be asked:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">That is to say,<br/> the group of grasping after material shape,<br/> the group of grasping after feeling,<br/> the group of grasping after perception,<br/> the group of grasping after the habitual tendencies,<br/> the group of grasping after consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I felt a touch with the body<br/> I was not entranced by the general appearance,<br/> I was not entranced by the detail.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I dwelt with this organ of touch uncontrolled,<br/> covetousness and dejection,<br/> evil unskilled states,<br/> might flow in.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I fared along controlling it,<br/> I guarded the organ of touch,<br/> I achieved control over the organ of touch.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I cognised a mental state with the mind<br/> I was not entranced by the general appearance,<br/> I was not entranced by the detail.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I dwelt with this organ of mind uncontrolled,<br/> covetousness and dejection,<br/> evil unskilled states,<br/> might flow in.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I fared along controlling it,<br/> I guarded the organ of mind,<br/> I achieved control over the organ of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">I,<br/> posaessed of this ariyan control<br/> over the sense-organs,<br/> inwardly experienced<br/> the bliss of being "unaffected."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Whether I was setting out<br/> or returning,<br/> I was one who comported myself properly;<br/> whether I was looking down<br/> or looking round,<br/> I was one who comported myself properly;<br/> bending back<br/> or stretching out (my arm),<br/> I was one who comported myself properly;<br/> carrying my outer cloak,<br/> bowl<br/> or robe,<br/> I was one who comported myself properly;<br/> munching,<br/> drinking,<br/> eating,<br/> savouring,<br/> I was one who comported myself properly;<br/> obeying the calls of nature,<br/> I was one who comported myself properly;<br/> walking,<br/> standing,<br/> sitting,<br/> asleep,<br/> awake,<br/> talking<br/> or silent,<br/> I was one who comported myself properly.</p>

    <p class="f4">Possessed of this ariyan body of moral habit and<br/> possessed of this ariyan control over the sense-organs and<br/> possessed of this ariyan mindfulness and clear consciousness,<br/> I chose a remote lodging in a forest,<br/> at the root of a tree,<br/> on a mountain slope,<br/> in a wilderness,<br/> a hill-cave,<br/> a cemetery,<br/> a forest haunt,<br/> in the open or on a heap of straw.</p>

    <p class="f4">Returning from alms-gathering<br/> after the meal,<br/> I sat down cross-legged,<br/> holding the back erect,<br/> having made mindfulness rise up in front of me.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of covetousness for the world,<br/> I dwelt with a mind devoid of coveting,<br/> I purified the mind of coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of the taint of ill-will,<br/> I dwelt benevolent in mind;<br/> and compassionate for the welfare<br/> of all creatures and beings,<br/> I purified the mind of the taint of ill-will.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of sloth and torpor,<br/> I dwelt devoid of sloth and torpor;<br/> perceiving the light,<br/> mindful and clearly conscious,<br/> I purified the mind of sloth and torpor.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of restlessness and worry,<br/> I dwelt calmly,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span> the mind subjectively tranqilised,<br/> I purified the mind of restlesssness and worry.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of doubt,<br/> I dwelt doubt-crossed,<br/> unperplexed as to the states that are skilled,<br/> I purified the mind of doubt.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of these five hindrances —<br/> defilements of the mind and weakening to intuitive wisdom —<br/> aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br/> aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br/> I entered on and abided in the first meditation<br/> which is accompanied by initial thought<br/> and discursive thought,<br/> is born of aloofness,<br/> and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

    <p class="f4">By allaying initial thought and discursive thought,<br/> his mind subjectively tranquillised<br/> and fixed on one point,<br/> I entered on<br/> and abided in<br/> the second meditation<br/> which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br/> is born of concentration<br/> and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

    <p class="f4">By the fading out of rapture,<br/> I dwelt with equanimity,<br/> attentive and clearly conscious,<br/> and experiencing in my person<br/> that joy of which the ariyans say:<br/> 'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br/> I entered on<br/> and abided in<br/> the third meditation.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of joy<br/> and by getting rid of anguish,<br/> by the going down of my former pleasures and sorrows,<br/> I entered on<br/> and abided in<br/> the fourth meditation<br/> which has neither anguish nor joy,<br/> and which is entirely purified<br/> by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus with the mind composed,<br/> quite purified,<br/> quite clarified,<br/> without blemish,<br/> without defilement,<br/> grown soft and workable,<br/> stable,<br/> immovable,<br/> I directed my mind<br/> to the knowledge of<br/> the destruction of the cankers.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is anguish.</p>

    <p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">This the arising of anguish.</p>

    <p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">This the stopping of anguish.</p>

    <p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">This the course<br/> leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

    <p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the cankers.</p>

    <p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of the cankers.</p>

    <p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

    <p class="f4">This the course<br/> leading to the stopping of the cankers.</p>

    <p class="f4">When I knew and saw this thus,<br/> my mind was freed<br/> from the canker of the sense-pleasures and<br/> my mind was freed<br/> from the canker of becoming and<br/> my mind was freed<br/> from the canker of ignorance.</p>

    <p class="f4">In freedom<br/> the knowledge came to be that<br/> I was freed and<br/> I comprehended:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br/> brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br/> done is what was to be done,<br/> there is no more of being such or so.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So, your reverences,<br/> as I know <span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span> thus,<br/> see thus,<br/> in respect of this consciousness-informed body<br/> and all external phenomena,<br/> I can say that my tendency to pride that<br/> "I am the doer,<br/> mine is the doer"<br/> has been properly extirpated.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, that monk's words<br/> should be rejoiced in<br/> and approved of<br/> by the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is good.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When they have rejoiced in<br/> and approved of his words,<br/> saying: 'It is good,'<br/> he should be informed thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is a gain for you, your reverence,<br/> it is well gotten by you, your reverence,<br/> that we see a Brahma-farer<br/> in one such as is the venerable one.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Delighted, these monks rejoiced<br/> in what the Lord had said.</p>

But <i>Theras</i> living overseas reduce the conciousness-informed body of oneself and of others to one (category) and speak of the six parts together with the four kinds of nutriment.
