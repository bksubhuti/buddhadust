    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> H<span class="f2"><b>AVE</b></span> I H<span class="f2"><b>EARD</b></span>:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> in the Eastern monastery<br/> in the palace of Migara's mother.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br/> emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br/> approached the Lord;<br/> having approached and greeted the Lord,<br/> he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/> the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"At one time, revered sir,<br/> the Lord was staying among the Sakyans.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nagaraka is the name of a market town of the Sakyans.</p>

    <p class="f4">And while I was there, revered sir,<br/> face-to-face with the Lord I heard,<br/> face-to-face I learnt:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I Ānanda,<br/> through abiding in (the concept of) emptiness,<br/> am now abiding in the fullness thereof.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">I hope that I heard this properly, revered sir,<br/> learnt it properly,<br/> attended to it properly<br/> and understood it properly?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Certainly, Ānanda,<br/> you heard this properly,<br/> learnt it properly,<br/> attended to it properly<br/> and understood it properly.</p>

    <p class="f4">Formerly I, Ānanda,<br/> as well as now,<br/> through abiding in (the concept of) emptiness,<br/> abide in the fullness thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">As this palace of Migara's mother<br/> is empty of elephants,<br/> cows,<br/> horses<br/> and mares,<br/> empty of gold and silver,<br/> empty of assemblages of men and women,<br/> and there is only this that is not emptiness,<br/> that is to say<br/> the solitude<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> grounded on the Order of monks;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> even so, Ānanda, a monk,<br/> not attending to the perception of village,<br/> not attending to the perception of human beings,<br/> attends to solitude<br/> grounded on the perception of forest.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He comprehends thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The disturbances there might be<br/> resulting from the perception of village<br/> do not exist here;<br/> the disturbances there might be<br/> resulting from the perception of human beings<br/> do not exist here.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is only this degree of disturbance,<br/> that is to say<br/> solitude grounded on the perception of forest.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But in regard to what remains there<br/> he comprehends:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That being, this is.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, this comes to be for him<br/> a true,<br/> not a mistaken,<br/> utterly purified<br/> realization of (the concept of) emptiness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>
