    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[16]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, become my heirs of <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    not heirs of material things.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">I have sympathy with you and think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How may disciples become my heirs of <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    not heirs of material things?'</p>

    <p class="f4">If you, monks, should become heirs of material things,<br/>

    not heirs of <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    not only may you become in consequence<br/>

    those of whom it is said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Teacher's disciples<br/>

    are heirs of material things,<br/>

    not heirs of <span class="f2 g"><b>[17]</b></span> <i>Dhamma,'</i></p>

    <p class="f4">but I too may become in consequence<br/>

    one of whom it is said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Teacher's disciples<br/>

    are heirs of material things,<br/>

    not heirs of <i>Dhamma,'</i></p>

    <p class="f4">But if you, monks, should become my heirs of <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    not heirs of material things,<br/>

    then you may become in consequence<br/>

    those of whom it is said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Teacher's disciples<br/>

    are heirs of <i>Dhamma,</i><br/>

    not heirs of material things,'</p>

    <p class="f4">and I too may become in consequence<br/>

    one of whom it is said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Teacher's disciples<br/>

    are heirs of <i>Dhamma,</i><br/>

    not heirs of material things.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, monks, become my heirs of <i>Dhamma,</i>,<br/>

    not heirs of material things.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have sympathy with you and think:</p>

    <p class="f4">How may disciples become my heirs of <i>Dhamma,</i>,<br/>

    not heirs of material things?</p>

    <p class="f4">Take a case where I, monks,<br/>

    may have eaten<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> and be satisfied,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    (the meal) ended, finished,<br/>

    I having had enough,<br/>

    as much as I pleased.</p>

    <p class="f4">But it may be that some of my almsfood is over<br/>

    and is to be thrown away,<br/>

    when two monks may arrive<br/>

    worn out with exhaustion and hunger.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">If I should speak to them thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, monks, have eaten and am satisfied<br/>

    (the meal) ended, finished,<br/>

    I having had enough,<br/>

    as much as I pleased.</p>

    <p class="f4">But some of my almsfood is over<br/>

    and is to be thrown away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do eat it if you (so) desire;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    if you do not eat it<br/>

    I will now throw it away<br/>

    where there is no grass<br/>

    or I will drop it into water<br/>

    that has no living creatures in it.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then it may occur to one monk:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, the Lord having eaten and being satisfied<br/>

    (the meal) ended, finished,<br/>

    having had enough,<br/>

    as much as he pleased.</p>

    <p class="f4">But this almsfood of the Lord's is to be thrown away;<br/>

    if we do not eat it,<br/>

    the Lord will now throw it <span class="f2 g"><b>[18]</b></span> away<br/>

    where there is no grass<br/>

    or he will drop it into water<br/>

    that has no living creatures in it.</p>

    <p class="f4">But this was said by the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, become my heirs of <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    not heirs of material things."</p>

    <p class="f4">But this is a material thing,<br/>

    that is to say, almsfood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose that I,<br/>

    not having eaten this almsfood,<br/>

    in spite of this hunger and exhaustion,<br/>

    should pass this night and day thus?'</p>

    <p class="f4">He, not having eaten that almsfood,<br/>

    in spite of that hunger and exhaustion,<br/>

    may pass this night and day thus.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurs to the second monk, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, the Lord having eaten and being satisfied<br/>

    (the meal) ended, finished,<br/>

    having had enough,<br/>

    as much as he pleased.</p>

    <p class="f4">But this almsfood of the Lord's is to be thrown away;<br/>

    if we do not eat it,<br/>

    the Lord will now throw it away<br/>

    where there is no grass<br/>

    or he will drop it into water<br/>

    that has no living creatures in it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose that I,<br/>

    having eaten this alms-food,<br/>

    having driven away this hunger and exhaustion,<br/>

    should pass this night and day thus?'</p>

    <p class="f4">He, having eaten that almsfood,<br/>

    having driven away that hunger and exhaustion,<br/>

    may spend that night and day thus.</p>

    <p class="f4">Although, monks, that monk,<br/>

    having eaten that almsfood,<br/>

    having driven away this hunger and exhaustion,<br/>

    should pass this night and day thus,<br/>

    he, having eaten that almsfood,<br/>

    having driven away that hunger and exhaustion,<br/>

    may spend that night and day thus,<br/>

    yet that first monk is for me<br/>

    the more to be honoured<br/>

    and the more to be praised.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is, monks, that it will conduce for a long time<br/>

    to that monk's desirelessness,<br/>

    to his contentment,<br/>

    expunging (of evil),<br/>

    to his being easily supported,<br/>

    to his putting forth energy.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, monks, become my heirs of <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    not heirs of material things.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have sympathy with you and think:</p>

    <p class="f4">How may disciples become my heirs of <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    and not heirs of material things?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord;<br/>

    when the Well-farer had spoken thus,<br/>

    rising from his seat,<br/>

    he entered the dwelling-place.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    not long after the Lord had gone away,<br/>

    addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Your reverence,"<br/>

    these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In what respects, your reverences,<br/>

    while the Teacher is staying in seclusion,<br/>

    do disciples not follow his example of aloofness?</p>

    <p class="f4">And in what respects,<br/>

    while the Teacher is staying in seclusion,<br/>

    do disciples follow his example of aloofness?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"We would come even from afar<br/>

    to learn from the venerable Sāriputta<br/>

    the meaning of this that is said.</p>

    <p class="f4">It were good indeed<br/>

    if the meaning of this that is said<br/>

    should be spoken out by the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    so that monks,<br/>

    having heard the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    might master it."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very well, your reverences,<br/>

    listen,<br/>

    attend carefully,<br/>

    and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br/>

    these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is a case, your reverences,<br/>

    where, while the Teacher is staying in seclusion,<br/>

    disciples do not follow his example as to aloofness,<br/>

    they do not get rid of those things<br/>

    of which the Teacher <span class="f2 g"><b>[19]</b></span> has spoken of getting rid,<br/>

    they are ones for abundance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> and are lax,<br/>

    taking the lead in backsliding,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>

    throwing off the yoke<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> of seclusion.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Among them,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> your reverences,<br/>

    monks who are elders<br/>

    become contemptible in three ways:</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p class="f2">Horner here has ignored the quotation marks around the initial statements of the three ways, Bhk. Bodhi also does not follow the Pali here. Bhk. Sujato has the idea here more or less correctly:  "In this case, the senior mendicants should be criticized on three grounds. 'The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion.'</p>
