    go down to wash in the river Bāhukā?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Brahman, what is there<br/>

    to the river Bāhukā?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what use is the river Bāhuka?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, good Gotama, the river Bāhukā<br/>

    is considered by the many-folk<br/>

    as a means of purification,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a></sup></span><br/>

    the river Bāhukā is considered by the manyfolk<br/>

    to be for merit.</p>

    <p class="f4">For in the river Bāhukā<br/>

    the many-folk wash away<br/>

    the evil deeds that have been done."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the brahman Sundarika-Bhāradvājai in verses:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"In the Bāhukā, and at Adhikakkā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a></sup></span><br/>

    At Gayā,<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n24">24</a></sup></span> and in the Sundarikā,<br/>

    In the Sarassatī, and at Payāga,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a></sup></span><br/>

    Then in the river Bāhumatī,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a></sup></span><br/>

    The fool, though entering constantly,<br/>

    Does not cleanse his dark deed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">What can the Sundarikā, do?<br/>

    What Payāga, what the Bāhukā river?<br/>

    They do not cleanse that hostile guilty man<br/>

    Intent on evil deeds.<br/>

    For the pure every day is auspicious,<br/>

    for the pure every day is holy,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a></sup></span><br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[50]</b></span> For the pure of bright deeds<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a></sup></span><br/>

    there is ever the practice of (good) custom.<br/>

    Bathe in this only,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a></sup></span> brahman,<br/>

    Make all creatures secure.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">If you do not speak a lie,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a></sup></span><br/>

    if you harm no living thing,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a></sup></span><br/>

    If you take not the ungiven,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a></sup></span><br/>

    are believing, not stingy —<br/>

    What can you do by going to Gayā,<br/>

    when Gayā is only a well<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a></sup></span> for you?"</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the brahman Sundarika-Bhāradvājai<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama;<br/>

    it is excellent, good Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br/>

    one might set upright<br/>

    what had been upset,<br/>

    or disclose what had been covered,<br/>

    or show the way<br/>

    to one who had gone astray,<br/>

    or bring an oil lamp into the darkness<br/>

    so that those with vision might see material shapes;<br/>

    even so<br/>

    in many a figure<br/>

    has <i>Dhamma</i> been made clear by the good Gotama,<br/>

    I,<br/>

    even I,<br/>

    am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,<br/>

    and to <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    and to the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">May I receive the going forth<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a></sup></span><br/>

    in the presence of the good Gotama,<br/>

    may I receive ordination."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahman Sundarika-Bhāradvājai<br/>

    received the going forth<br/>

    in the Lord's presence,<br/>

    he received ordination.</p>

    <p class="f4">Soon after he had been ordained<br/>

    the venerable Bhāradvājai,<br/>

    abiding alone,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a></sup></span><br/>

    aloof,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a></sup></span><br/>

    diligent,<br/>

    ardent,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a></sup></span><br/>

    self-resolute,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a></sup></span><br/>

    not long afterwards,<br/>

    by his own super-knowledge,<br/>

    having precisely here-now<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a></sup></span> realized<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[51]</b></span> that matchless culmination of the Brahma-faring<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a></sup></span><br/>

    for the sake of which<br/>

    young men of family<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a></sup></span><br/>

    rightly go forth from home<br/>

    into homelessness,<br/>

    abided in it.</p>

    <p class="f4">He comprehended:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed is birth,<br/>

    brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br/>

    done is what was to be done,<br/>

    there is no more of being such or such."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the venerable Bhāradvājai<br/>

    became one of the perfected ones.</p>
