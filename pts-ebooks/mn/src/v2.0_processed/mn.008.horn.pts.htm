    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Cunda the Great,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    emerging towards evening from solitary meditation,<br/>

    approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    having greeted the Lord,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br/>

    the venerable Cunda the Great spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Those various types of views,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Lord,<br/>

    that arise in the world<br/>

    and are connected with theories of the self<br/>

    or with theories of the world,<br/>

    does there come to be ejection of these views,<br/>

    does there come to be renunciation of these views<br/>

    for a monk who wisely reflects from the beginning?"</p>

    wherever these views arise<br/>

    and wherever they obsess (the mind)<br/>

    and wherever they are current,<br/>

    it is by seeing them with perfect wisdom<br/>

    as they really are,<br/>

    thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    <p class="f4">The situation occurs, Cunda,<br/>

    when a monk here,<br/>

    aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br/>

    may enter on and abide in the first meditation<br/>

    which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,<br/>

    is born of aloofness,<br/>
