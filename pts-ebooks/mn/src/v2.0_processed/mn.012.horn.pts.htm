    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Vesālī<br/>

    outside the town<br/>

    in a woodland thicket to the west.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    having recently left this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline,<br/>

    spoke these words to a group (of people) at Vesālī:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are no states of further-men,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    beaten out by reasoning<br/>

    and based on investigation;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    and says that <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    having dressed early in the morning,<br/>

    taking his bowl and robe,<br/>

    entered Vesālī for almsfood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta heard that speech of Sunakkhatta,<br/>

    the son of a Licchavi,<br/>

    as it was being spoken to the group (of people) in Vesālī:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are no states of further-men,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta, having walked in Vesālī for almsfood,<br/>

    after the meal<br/>

    returning from (his quest for<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span>) alms,<br/>

    approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    having greeted the Lord,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, Sunakkhatta, the son of a Licchavi,<br/>

    spoke these words to a group (of people) at Vesālī:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta is a man of wrath and folly,<br/>

    <p class="f4">he, Sāriputta,<br/>

    the foolish man Sunakkhatta,<br/>

    really spoke praise of the <i>Tathāgata</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">For this, Sāriputta, is praise of a <i>Tathāgata</i>:<br/>

    <p class="f4">But, Sāriputta, there will not be for Sunakkhatta,<br/>

The problems in attaining, clarification of, and emergence from a state of release in serenity attained through <i>jhāna?</i> If not, what is the implied distinction between <i>'jhāna'</i> and <i>'samādhi'</i>?
