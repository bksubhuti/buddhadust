    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anathapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>

    a pernicious view had arisen like this<br/>

    in a monk named Ariṭṭha<br/>

    who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"In so far as I understand <i>Dhamma</i><br/>

    called stumbling-blocks by the Lord,<br/>

    there is no stumbling-block at all."</p>

    <p class="f4">Several monks heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">"A pernicious view has arisen<br/>

    to the monk named Ariṭṭha,<br/>

    who was formerly a vulture-trainer,<br/>

    like this:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then these monks approached the monk Ariṭṭha,<br/>

    who had formerly been a vulture-trainer;<br/>
