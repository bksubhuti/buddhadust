    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[230]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Your reverence," these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"As, your reverences,<br/>

    among all creatures that can walk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    all pedal qualities are combined in an elephant's foot,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    and as the elephant's foot is chief among these<br/>

    in point of size,<br/>

    so, your reverences,<br/>

    all skilled states of mind<br/>

    are included among the four ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Among what four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Among the ariyan truth of anguish,<br/>

    among the ariyan truth of the uprising of anguish,<br/>

    among the ariyan truth of the stopping of anguish,<br/>

    among the ariyan truth of the course<br/>

    leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[231]</b></span> And what, your reverences,<br/>

    is the ariyan truth of anguish?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Birth is anguish<br/>

    and ageing is anguish<br/>

    and dying is anguish;<br/>

    and grief,<br/>

    lamentation,<br/>

    sorrow,<br/>

    tribulation<br/>

    and despair are anguish,<br/>

    and not getting what one wants,<br/>

    that too is anguish.</p>

    <p class="f4">In brief<br/>

    the five groups of grasping are anguish.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, your reverences,<br/>

    are the five groups of grasping?</p>

    <p class="f4">Just these;<br/>

    the group of grasping after material shape,<br/>

    the group of grasping after feeling,<br/>

    the group of grasping after perception,<br/>

    the group of grasping after the habitual tendencies,<br/>

    the group of grasping after consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, your reverences,<br/>

    is the group of grasping after material shapes?</p>

    <p class="f4">The four great elements,<br/>

    and the material shape that is derived<br/>

    from the four great elements.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, your reverences,<br/>

    are the four great elements?</p>

    <p class="f4">The element of extension,<br/>

    the liquid element,<br/>

    the element of heat,<br/>

    the element of motion.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    it may be external.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> your reverences,<br/>

    and whatever is an external element of extension,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>

    just these are the element of extension.</p>

    <p class="f4">By means of perfect intuitive wisdom<br/>

    he disregards the element of extension,<br/>

    he cleanses his mind<br/>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span> There comes to be a time, your reverences,<br/>
