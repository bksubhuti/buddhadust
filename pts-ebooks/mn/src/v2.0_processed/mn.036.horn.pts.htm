    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[291]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Vesālī<br/>

    in the Great Grove in the hall of the Gabled House.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the Lord came to be fully clothed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> in the morning<br/>

    and, taking his bowl and robe,<br/>

    wished to enter Vesālī for almsfood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br/>

    who was always pacing up and down,<br/>

    always roaming about on foot,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    approached the Great Grove<br/>

    and the hall of the Gabled House.</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Ānanda saw Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br/>

    coming in the distance;<br/>

    having seen him,<br/>

    he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, this Saccaka, the son of Jains, is coming,<br/>

    a controversialist,<br/>

    giving himself out as learned,<br/>

    much honoured by the manyfolk.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He, Lord, desires dispraise of the Awakened One,<br/>

    dispraise of <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    dispraise of the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">It were good, Lord,<br/>

    if the Lord were to sit down for a moment<br/>

    out of compassion."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord sat down on an appointed seat.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Saccaka, the son of Jains, approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br/>

    having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    Saccaka, the son of Jains, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span> There are, good Gotama, some recluses and brahmans,<br/>

    who dwell intent on the development of body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    not on the development of mind.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">They acquire, good Gotama,<br/>

    a feeling of physical pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">If once upon a time, good Gotama,<br/>

    there had been acquired a feeling of physical pain,<br/>

    there may be paralysis of the legs,<br/>

    and the heart may burst,<br/>

    and warm blood may issue from the mouth,<br/>

    or one may come to madness,<br/>

    to mind-tossing.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This comes to be for one, good Gotama,<br/>

    when the mind conforms to the body,<br/>

    when it is under the rule of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the cause of this?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the non-development of the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">But there are, good Gotama, some recluses and brahmans<br/>

    who live intent on the development of mind,<br/>

    not on the development of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">They acquire, good Gotama,<br/>

    a feeling of mental pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">If once upon a time, good Gotama,<br/>

    there had been acquired a feeling of mental pain,<br/>

    there may be a paralysis of the legs,<br/>

    and the heart may burst,<br/>

    and warm blood may issue from the mouth,<br/>

    or one may come to madness,<br/>

    to mind-tossing.</p>

    <p class="f4">This comes to be for one, good Gotama,<br/>

    whose body conforms to mind,<br/>

    is under the rule of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the cause of this?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the non-development of body."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But what have you, Aggivessana,<br/>

    heard about the development of body?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For example, Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṇkicca, Makkhali of the Cowpen<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> -<br/>

    these, good Gotama, are unclothed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    flouting life's decencies,<br/>

    licking (their hands after meals),<br/>

    not those to come<br/>

    when asked to do so,<br/>

    not those to stand still<br/>

    when asked to do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not consent (to accept food)<br/>

    offered to (them)<br/>

    or specially prepared for (them),<br/>

    nor to (accept) an invitation (to a meal).</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not accept food<br/>

    straight from the cooking pot or pan,<br/>

    nor within the threshould,<br/>

    nor among the faggots,<br/>

    nor among the rice- <span class="f2 g"><b>[293]</b></span> pounders,<br/>

    nor when two people were eating,<br/>

    nor from a pregnant woman,<br/>

    nor from one giving suck,<br/>

    nor from one co-habiting with a man,<br/>

    nor from gleanings,<br/>

    nor near where a dog is standing,<br/>

    nor where flies are swarming,<br/>

    nor fish,<br/>

    nor meat.</p>

    <p class="f4">They drink neither fermented liquor<br/>

    nor spirits<br/>

    nor rice-gruel.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are one-house-men,<br/>

    a one-piece-men,<br/>

    or a two-house-men,<br/>

    a two-piece-men<br/>

    or a three-house-men,<br/>

    a three-piece-men<br/>

    or a four-house-men,<br/>

    a four-piece-men<br/>

    a six-piece-men<br/>

    or a seven-house-men,<br/>

    a seven-piece-men.</p>

    <p class="f4">They subsist on one little offering,<br/>

    they subsist on five little offerings<br/>

    they subsist on six little offerings<br/>

    they subsist on seven little offerings.</p>

    <p class="f4">They take food only once a day,<br/>

    and they take food once in two days<br/>

    and they take food once in three days<br/>

    and they take food once in four days<br/>

    and they take food once in five days<br/>

    and they take food once in six days<br/>

    and they take food once in seven days.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then they live intent on the practice<br/>

    of eating rice at regular fort-nightly intervals.</p>

    <p class="f4">"But do they, Aggivessana, keep going on so little?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, good Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now and then they eat very good solid food,<br/>

    partake of very good soft food,<br/>

    savour very good savourings,<br/>

    drink very good drinks.</p>

    <p class="f4">They build up their bodily strength with these,<br/>

    make their bodies grow and become fat."</p>

    <p class="f4">"These, Aggivessana, attend later<br/>

    to what they had eschewed earlier;<br/>

    thus there is increase and loss for that body.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But what have you, Aggivessana,<br/>

    heard about the development of mind?"</p>

    <p class="f4">But, Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br/>

    on being questioned by the Lord<br/>

    on the development of mind,<br/>

    did not succeed (in replying).</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus to Saccaka, the son of Jains:</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which was first spoken of by you, Aggivessana,<br/>

    as the development of the body,<br/>

    that, in the discipline for an ariyan,<br/>

    is not the proper development of the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">For you, Aggivessana,<br/>

    do not know what is development of the body,<br/>

    so how can you know<br/>

    what is development of the mind?</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet, Aggivessana, hear how there comes to be<br/>

    one who is not developed as to body<br/>

    and not developed as to mind,<br/>

    developed as to body<br/>

    and developed as to mind;<br/>

    pay careful attention<br/>

    and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, sir," Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br/>

    answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"And how, Aggivessana, does one come to be<br/>

    not developed as to body<br/>

    and not developed as to mind?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, Aggivessana,<br/>

    a pleasurable feeling arises in an uninstructed ordinary man;<br/>

    he, being assailed by the pleasurable feeling,<br/>

    becomes addicted to pleasure<br/>

    and falls into addiction for pleasure.</p>

    <p class="f4">If that pleasurable feeling of his is stopped,<br/>

    a painful feeling arises from the stopping <span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span> of the pleasurable feeling;<br/>

    he, being assailed by the painful feeling,<br/>

    grieves,<br/>

    mourns,<br/>

    laments,<br/>

    beats his breast<br/>

    and falls into disillusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">This pleasurable feeling, Aggivessana,<br/>

    that has arisen in him,<br/>

    impinging on the mind,<br/>

    persists,<br/>

    because of the non-development of body;<br/>

    and the painful feeling that has arisen,<br/>

    impinging on the mind,<br/>

    persists,<br/>

    because of the non-development of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">In anyone in whom, Aggivessana,<br/>

    there are these two alternatives thus:<br/>

    a pleasurable feeling that has arisen,<br/>

    impinging on the mind,<br/>

    persists,<br/>

    because of the non-development of body;<br/>

    and a painful feeling that has arisen,<br/>

    impinging on the mind,<br/>

    persists,<br/>

    because of the non-development of mind -<br/>

    he thus comes to be, Aggivessana,<br/>

    not developed as to body<br/>

    and not developed as to mind.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how does there come to be, Aggivessana,<br/>

    one who is both developed as to body<br/>

    and developed as to mind?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, Aggivessana, a pleasurable feeling arises<br/>

    in an instructed disciple of the ariyans;<br/>

    he, being assailed by the pleasurable feeling,<br/>

    does not become addicted to pleasure<br/>

    nor does he fall into addiction to pleasure.</p>

    <p class="f4">If that pleasurable feeling of his is stopped<br/>

    and a painful feeling arises<br/>

    from the stopping of that pleasurable feeling,<br/>

    he, being assailed by the painful feeling,<br/>

    does not grieve,<br/>

    mourn,<br/>

    lament,<br/>

    he does not beat his breast,<br/>

    he does not fall into disillusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">This pleasurable feeling, Aggivessana,<br/>

    that has arisen in him,<br/>

    impinging on his mind,<br/>

    does not persist,<br/>

    because of the development of the body;<br/>

    and the painful feeling that has arisen,<br/>

    impinging on the mind,<br/>

    does not persist,<br/>

    because of the development of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">In anyone in whom, Aggivessana,<br/>

    there are these two alternatives thus:<br/>

    a pleasurable feeling that has arisen,<br/>

    impinging on the mind,<br/>

    does not persist,<br/>

    because of the development of body;<br/>

    and a painful feeling that has arisen,<br/>

    impinging on the mind,<br/>

    does not persist,<br/>

    because of the development of mind -<br/>

    he thus comes to be, Aggivessana,<br/>

    both developed as to body<br/>

    and developed as to mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"A believer thus am I<br/>

    in the revered Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the revered Gotama<br/>

    is both developed as to body<br/>

    and developed as to mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"This speech spoken by you, Aggivessana,<br/>

    is offensive and presumptuous,<br/>

    but yet will I answer you.</p>

    <p class="f4">When I, Aggivessana, had had the hair of my head and beard shaved,<br/>

    and had clothed myself in saffron garments<br/>

    and had gone forth from home into homelessness -<br/>

    that a pleasurable feeling arisen in me,<br/>

    impinging on my mind,<br/>

    could persist,<br/>

    or that a painful feeling arisen,<br/>

    impinging on my mind,<br/>

    could persist,<br/>

    such a situation could not occur."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[295]</b></span> "Is it then that a pleasurable feeling<br/>

    has not arisen in the good Gotama<br/>

    of such a nature that,<br/>

    having arisen,<br/>

    impinging on the mind,<br/>

    it could not persist?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is it then that a painful feeling<br/>

    has not arisen in the good Gotama<br/>

    of such a nature that,<br/>

    having arisen,<br/>

    impinging on the mind,<br/>

    it could not persist?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"How could this not be, Aggivessana?</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Aggivessana, before my Self-awakening<br/>

    while I was still the bodhisatta,<br/>

    not fully awakened,<br/>

    it occurred to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">Narrow is the household life,<br/>

    a path of dust,<br/>

    going forth is in the open,<br/>

    nor is it easy while dwelling in a house<br/>

    to lead the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled,<br/>

    utterly purified,<br/>

    polished like a conch-shell.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose now that I,<br/>

    having cut off hair and beard,<br/>

    having clothed myself in saffron garments,<br/>

    should go forth from home into homelessness?</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, alter a time,<br/>

    being young,<br/>

    my hair coal-black,<br/>

    possessed of radiant youth,<br/>

    in the prime of my life —<br/>

    although my unwilling parents wept and wailed —<br/>

    having cut off my hair and beard,<br/>

    having put on yellow robes,<br/>

    went forth from home into homelessness.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, being gone forth thus,<br/>

    a quester for whatever is good,<br/>

    searching for the incomparable,<br/>

    matchless path to peace,<br/>

    approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, reverend Kālāma, want to fare the Brahmā-faring<br/>

    in this dhamma and discipline.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This said, Aggivessana, Āḷāra the Kālāma spoke thus to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let the venerable one proceed;<br/>

    this dhamma is such<br/>

    that an intelligent man,<br/>

    having soon realized super-knowledge for himself<br/>

    (as learnt from) his own teacher,<br/>

    may enter on and abide in it.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana,<br/>

    very soon,<br/>

    very quickly,<br/>

    mastered that dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, Aggivessana, as far as mere lip service,<br/>

    mere repetition<br/>

    were concerned,<br/>

    spoke the doctrine of knowledge,<br/>

    and the doctrine of the elders,<br/>

    and I claimed —<br/>

    I as well as others —<br/>

    that 'I know, I see.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'But Āḷāra the Kālāma does not merely proclaim this dhamma<br/>

    simply out of faith:<br/>

    Having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br/>

    entering on it,<br/>

    I am abiding therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">For surely Āḷāra the Kālāma proceeds knowing,<br/>

    seeing this dhamma.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then did I, Aggivessana, approach Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

    <p class="f4">'To what extent do you, reverend Kālāma,<br/>

    having realized super-knowledge for yourself,<br/>

    entering thereon,<br/>

    proclaim this dhamma?'</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said, Aggivessana,<br/>

    Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaimed the plane of no-thing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has faith,<br/>

    I too have faith.<br/>

    It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has energy,<br/>

    I too have energy.<br/>

    It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has mindfulness,<br/>

    I too have mindfulness.<br/>

    It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has concentration,<br/>

    I too have concentration.<br/>

    It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has intuitive wisdom,<br/>

    I too have intuitive wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose now that I should strive for the realisation of that dhamma<br/>

    which Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaims:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br/>

    entering on it I am abiding therein?'</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, very soon,<br/>

    very quickly,<br/>

    having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br/>

    entering on that dhamma,<br/>

    abided therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I, Aggivessana, approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is it to this extent that you, reverend Kalama,<br/>

    proclaim this dhamma,<br/>

    entering on it,<br/>

    having realized it by your own super-knowledge?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is to this extent that I, your reverence,<br/>

    proclaim this dhamma,<br/>

    entering on it,<br/>

    having realized it by my own super-knowledge.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'I too, your reverence,<br/>

    having realized this dhamma by my own super-knowledge,<br/>

    entering on it<br/>

    am abiding in it.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is profitable for us,<br/>

    it is well gotten for us, your reverence,<br/>

    that we see a fellow Brahmā-farer<br/>

    such as the venerable one.</p>

    <p class="f4">This dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim,<br/>

    having realized it by my own super-knowledge,<br/>

    is the dhamma that you, entering on,<br/>

    are abiding in,<br/>

    having realized it by your own super-knowledge;<br/>

    the dhamma that you, entering on, are abiding in,<br/>

    having realized it by your own super-knowledge,<br/>

    is the dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim,<br/>

    having realized it by my own super-knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">The dhamma that I know,<br/>

    this is the dhamma that you know.<br/>

    The dhamma that you know,<br/>

    this is the dhamma that I know.</p>

    <p class="f4">As I am,<br/>

    so are you;<br/>

    as you are,<br/>

    so am I.</p>

    <p class="f4">Come now, your reverence,<br/>

    being just the two of us,<br/>

    let us look after this group.'</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way, Aggivessana, did Āḷāra the Kālāma,<br/>

    being my teacher,<br/>

    set me<br/>

    — the pupil —<br/>

    on the same level as himself<br/>

    and honoured me with the highest honour.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This dhamma does not conduce to disregard<br/>

    nor to dispassion<br/>

    nor to stopping<br/>

    nor to tranquillity<br/>

    nor to super-knowledge<br/>

    nor to awakening<br/>

    nor to Nibbāna,<br/>

    but only as far as reaching the plane of no-thing.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana,<br/>

    not getting enough from this dhamma,<br/>

    disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I, monka, a quester for whatever is good,<br/>

    searching for the incomparable,<br/>

    matchless path to peace,<br/>

    approached Uddaka, Rāma's son;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, your reverence, want to fare the Brahmā-faring<br/>

    in this dhamma and discipline.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This said, Aggivessana, Uddaka, Rāma's son, spoke thus to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let the venerable one proceed;<br/>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">For surely Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br/>

    proceeds knowing and seeing this dhamma.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then did I, Aggivessana, approach Uddaka, Rāma's;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:</p>

    <p class="f4">'To what extent do you, reverend Rāma,<br/>

    having realized super-knowledge for yourself,<br/>

    entering thereon<br/>

    proclaim this dhamma?'</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said, Aggivessana,<br/>

    Uddahka, Rāma's son, proclaimed the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is not only  Rāma who has faith,<br/>

    I too have faith.<br/>

    It is not only  Rāma who has <b>[166]</b> energy,<br/>

    I too have energy.<br/>

    It is not only  Rāma who has mindfulness,<br/>

    I too have mindfulness.<br/>

    It is not only  Rāma who has concentration,<br/>

    I too have concentration.<br/>

    It is not only Rāma who has intuitive wisdom,<br/>

    I too have intuitive wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose now that I should strive for the realisation of that dhamma<br/>

    which Rāma proclaims:<br/>

    'Having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br/>

    entering on it<br/>

    I am abiding in it?'</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, very soon,<br/>

    very quickly,<br/>

    having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br/>

    entering on that dhamma,<br/>

    abided therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I, Aggivessana, approached Uddaka, Rāma's son;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is it to this extent that you, reverend Rāma,<br/>

    proclaim this dhamma,<br/>

    entering on it,<br/>

    having realized it by your own super-knowledge?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is to this extent that I, your reverence,<br/>

    proclaim this dhamma,<br/>

    entering on it,<br/>

    having realized it by my own super-knowledge.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'I too, your reverence,<br/>

    having realized this dhamma by my own super-knowledge,<br/>

    entering on it am abiding in it.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is profitable for us,<br/>

    it is well gotten by us, your reverence,<br/>

    that we see a fellow-Brahmā-farer<br/>

    such as the venerable one.</p>

    <p class="f4">This dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim,<br/>

    having realized it by my own super-knowledge,<br/>

    is the dhamma that you, entering on, are abiding in,<br/>

    having realized it by your own super-knowledge;<br/>

    the dhamma that you, entering on, are abiding in,<br/>

    having realized it by your own super-knowledge,<br/>

    is the dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim,<br/>

    having realized it by my own super-knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">The dhamma that I know,<br/>

    this is the dhamma that you know.</p>

    <p class="f4">That dhamma that you know,<br/>

    this is the dhamma that I know.</p>

    <p class="f4">As I am,<br/>

    so are you;<br/>

    as you are,<br/>

    so am I.</p>

    <p class="f4">Come now, your reverence,<br/>

    being just the two of us,<br/>

    let us look after this group.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way, Aggivessana, did Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br/>

    being my teacher, set me<br/>

    — the pupil —<br/>

    on the same level as himself<br/>

    and honoured me with the highest honour.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This dhamma does not conduce to disregard<br/>

    nor to dispassion<br/>

    nor to stopping<br/>

    nor to tranquillity<br/>

    nor to super-knowledge<br/>

    nor to awakening<br/>

    nor to Nibbāna,<br/>

    but only as far as reaching the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, not getting enough from this dhamma,<br/>

    disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I, Aggivessana, a quester for whatever is good,<br/>

    searching for the incomparable,<br/>

    matchless path to peace,<br/>

    walking on tour through Magadha<br/>

    in due course arrived at Uruvela,<br/>

    the camp township.</p>

    <p class="f4">There I saw a delightful stretch of land<br/>

    and a lovely woodland grove,<br/>

    and a clear flowing river<br/>

    with a delightful ford,<br/>

    and a village for support nearby.</p>

    <p class="f4">It occurred to me, Aggivessana:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed it it is a delightful stretch of land,<br/>

    and the woodland grove is lovely,<br/>

    and the river flows clear<br/>

    with a delightful ford,<br/>

    and there is a village for support nearby.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed this does well for the striving<br/>

    of a young man set on striving.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, sat down just there thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> Aggivessana,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Could that man, bringing an upper piece of fire-stick,<br/>

    light a fire,<br/>

    could he get heat?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, good Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the cause of this?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is, good Gotama,<br/>

    that such a stick is wet and sappy<br/>

    and that it was placed in water.</p>

    take the line of desisting from all food.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you, good sir,<br/>

    take the line of desisting from all food,<br/>

    then we will give you deva-like essences<br/>

    to take in through the pores of the skin;<br/>

    you will keep going by means of them.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Aggivessana, it occurred to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Suppose that I should take the line<br/>

    of not eating anything,<br/>

    and these <i>devatās</i> were to give me deva-like essences<br/>

    to take in through the pores of the skin,<br/>

    and that I should keep going by means of them,<br/>

    that would be an imposture in me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, rejected those <i>devatās</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a></sup></span><br/>

    I said,<br/>

    'Enough.'</p>

    <p class="f4">It occurred to me, Aggivessana:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Suppose now that I were to take food<br/>

    little by little,<br/>

    drop by drop,<br/>

    such as bean-soup<br/>

    or vetoh-soup<br/>

    or chick-pea-soup<br/>

    or pea-soup?</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, took food<br/>

    little by little,<br/>

    drop by drop,<br/>

    such as bean-soup<br/>

    or veteh-soup<br/>

    or chick-pea-soup<br/>

    or pea-soup.</p>

    <p class="f4">While I, Aggivessana, was taking food<br/>

    little by little,<br/>

    drop by drop,<br/>

    such as bean-soup<br/>

    or vetch-soup<br/>

    or chick-pea-soup<br/>

    or pea-soup,<br/>

    my body became exceedingly emaciated.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because I ate so little,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a></sup></span><br/>

    all my limbs became like the joints of withered creepers;<br/>

    because I ate so little,<br/>

    my buttocks became like a bullock's hoof;<br/>

    because I ate so little,<br/>

    my protruding backbone<br/>

    became like a string of balls;<br/>

    because I ate so little,<br/>

    my gaunt ribs<br/>

    became like the crazy rafters<br/>

    of a tumble-down shed;<br/>

    because I ate so little,<br/>

    the pupils of my eyes<br/>

    appeared lying low and deep;<br/>

    because I ate so little,<br/>

    my scalp became shrivelled and shrunk<br/>

    as a bitter white gourd<br/>

    cut before it is ripe<br/>

    becomes shrivelled and shrunk by a hot wind.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I, Aggivessana, thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will touch the skin of my belly,'<br/>

    it was my backbone that I took hold of.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will touch my backbone,'<br/>

    it was the skin of my belly that I took hold of.</p>

    <p class="f4">For because I ate so little,<br/>

    the skin of my belly, Aggivessana,<br/>

    came to be cleaving to my backbone.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I, Aggivessana, thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will obey the calls of nature,'<br/>

    I fell down on my face then and there,<br/>

    because I ate so little.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I, Aggivessana, soothing my body,<br/>

    stroked my limbs with my hand,<br/>

    the hairs,<br/>

    rotted at the roots,<br/>

    fell away from my body<br/>

    as I stroked my limbs with my hand,<br/>

    because I ate so little.</p>

    <p class="f4">And further, Aggivessana, men,<br/>

    having seen me,<br/>

    spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is black.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Other men spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is not black,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span> the recluse Gotama is deep brown.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Some men spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is not black,<br/>

    he is not even deep brown,<br/>

    the recluse Gotama is of a sallow colour.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">To such an extent, Aggivessana,<br/>

    was my clear pure complexion<br/>

    spoilt because I ate so little.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Aggivessana, occurred to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Some recluses and brahmans<br/>

    in the past<br/>

    have experienced feelings that were acute,<br/>

    painful,<br/>

    sharp,<br/>

    severe;<br/>

    but this is paramount,<br/>

    nor is there worse than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And some recluses and brahmans<br/>

    in the future<br/>

    will experience feelings that are acute,<br/>

    painful,<br/>

    sharp,<br/>

    severe;<br/>

    but this is paramount,<br/>

    nor is there worse than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And some recluses and brahmans<br/>

    are now<br/>

    experiencing feelings that are acute,<br/>

    painful,<br/>

    sharp,<br/>

    severe;<br/>

    but this is paramount,<br/>

    nor is there worse than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">But I,<br/>

    by this severe austerity,<br/>

    do not reach states of further-men,<br/>

    the excellent knowledge and vision<br/>

    befitting the ariyans.</p>

    <p class="f4">Could there be another way to awakening?</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Aggivessana, occurred to me:</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>This was no ordinary plowing! This was the spring plowing festival day, a fertility rite, and also the day of Gotama's reaching manhood. With the young Gotama sitting apart at peace under the apple tree, this becomes significant symbolism of a state separated from pleasures of the senses.</p>
