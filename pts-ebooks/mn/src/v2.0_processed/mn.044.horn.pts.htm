    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the layfollower Visākha<br/>

    approached the nun Dhammadinnā;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    having greeted the nun Dhammadinnā,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    the lay follower Visākha spoke thus<br/>

    to the nun Dhammadinnā:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lady, it is said,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Own body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    own body.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, lady, what is called<br/>

    'own body'<br/>

    by the Lord?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend Visākha,<br/>

    these five groups of grasping<br/>

    are called 'own body' by the Lord,<br/>

    that is to say,<br/>

    the group of grasping after material shape,<br/>

    the group of grasping after feeling,<br/>

    the group of grasping after perception,<br/>

    the group of grasping after the habitual tendencies,<br/>

    the group of grasping after consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">These five groups of grasping, friend Visākha,<br/>

    are called 'own body' by the Lord."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[361]</b></span> "It is good, lady,"<br/>

    and the lay follower Visākha,<br/>

    having rejoiced in what the nun Dhammadinnā had said,<br/>

    having thanked her,<br/>

    asked the nun Dhammadinnā a further question:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lady, it is said,</p>

    <p class="f4">'The uprising of own body,<br/>

    the uprising of own body.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, lady, what is called<br/>

    'the uprising of own body'<br/>

    by the Lord?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatever, friend Visākha,<br/>

    is the craving<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    connected with again-becoming,<br/>

    accompanied by delight and attachment,<br/>

    finding delight in this and that,<br/>

    namely the craving for sense-pleasures,<br/>

    the craving for becoming,<br/>

    the craving for annihilation,<br/>

    this, friend Visākha,<br/>

    is called 'the uprising of own body' by the Lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lady, it is said,</p>

    <p class="f4">'The stopping of own body,<br/>

    the stopping of own body.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, lady, what is called<br/>

    'stopping of own body'<br/>

    by the Lord?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatever, friend Visākha,vis the stopping,<br/>

    with no attachment remaining,<br/>

    of that self-same craving,<br/>

    the giving up of it,<br/>

    the renunciation of it,<br/>

    the release from it,<br/>

    the doing away with it,<br/>

    this, friend Visākha,<br/>

    is called 'The stopping of own body' by the Lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lady, it is said,</p>

    <p class="f4">'The course leading to the stopping of own body,<br/>

    the course leading to the stopping of own body.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, lady, what is called<br/>

    'the course leading to the stopping of own body'<br/>

    by the Lord?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This ariyan eightfold Way itself, friend Visākha,<br/>

    is called 'the course leading to the stopping of own body' by the Lord,<br/>

    that is to say perfect view,<br/>

    perfect thought,<br/>

    perfect speech,<br/>

    perfect action,<br/>

    perfect way of living,<br/>

    perfect endeavour,<br/>

    perfect mindfulness,<br/>

    perfect concentration."</p>
