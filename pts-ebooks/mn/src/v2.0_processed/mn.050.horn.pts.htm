    <p> <span class="f2 g"><b>[395]</b></span> </p>

    <p class="f4">T<span class="f3">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying among the Bhaggas in Sumsumāragira<br/>

    in Bhesakaḷā Grove in the deer-park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Moggallāna the Great was pacing up and down in the open.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time Māra the Evil One,<br/>

    entering the venerable Moggallāna the Great's belly,<br/>

    got into his stomach.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now why is my belly heavy as if it were heaped full?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great, having come down from the place for pacing up and down in,<br/>

    having entered the dwelling-place,<br/>

    sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down,<br/>

    the venerable Moggallāna the Great reflected carefully about himself.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great saw that Māra the Evil One,<br/>

    having entered his belly,<br/>

    had got into his stomach;<br/>

    seeing him, he spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Get out, Evil One;<br/>

    Evil One, get out;<br/>

    do not annoy a Tathāgata<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[396]</b></span> or a Tathāgata's disciple,<br/>

    lest for a long time there be woe and sorrow for you."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This recluse speaks thus not even knowing,<br/>

    not even seeing me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Get out, Evil One,<br/>

    Evil One, get out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not annoy a Tathāgata or a Tathāgata's disciple,<br/>

    lest for a long time there be woe and sorrow for you.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Even his teacher could not know me so quickly,<br/>

    so how can this disciple know me?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"But I do know you, Evil One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not you think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He does not know me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">You, Evil One, are Māra.</p>

    <p class="f4">It occurred to you, Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This recluse speaks thus not even knowing,<br/>

    not even seeing me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Get out, Evil One,<br/>

    Evil One, get out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not annoy a Tathāgata or a Tathāgata's disciple,<br/>

    lest for a long time there be woe and sorrow for you.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Even his teacher could not know me so quickly,<br/>

    so how can this disciple know me?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is because this recluse knows and sees me that he speaks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Get out, Evil One,<br/>

    Evil One, get out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not annoy a Tathāgata or a Tathāgata's disciple,<br/>

    lest for a long time there be woe and sorrow for you.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Māra the Evil One,  having gone out through the venerable Moggallāna the Great's mouth,<br/>

    stood against the door.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great saw<br/>

    Māra the Evil One<br/>

    standing against the door;<br/>

    seeing him,<br/>

    he spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed I do see you now, Evil One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He does not see me';</p>

    <p class="f4">it is you, Evil One,<br/>

    standing against the door.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, I, Evil One,<br/>

    was the Māra called Dūsin;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    as such Kāḷi was the name of my sister,<br/>

    you were her son,<br/>

    thus you were my nephew.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time, Evil One, Kakusandha,<br/>

    the Lord,<br/>

    the perfected one,<br/>

    fully self-awakened one,<br/>

    had uprisen in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Evil One, Vidhura and Sañjīva were the pair of disciples which was the chief,<br/>

    the lucky pair of Kakusandha,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    the Lord,<br/>

    the perfected one,<br/>

    the fully self-awakened one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of all the disciples, Evil One,<br/>

    of Kakusandha,<br/>

    the Lord,<br/>

    perfected one,<br/>

    fully self-awakened one,<br/>

    there was none there equal to the venerable Vidhura<br/>

    in regard to teaching <i>Dhamma</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">It was because of this, <span class="f2 g"><b>[397]</b></span> Evil One,<br/>

    that the venerable Vidhura's name came to be Vidhura, the Peerless.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the venerable Sañjīva, Evil One,<br/>

    forest-gone,<br/>

    gone to the roots of trees<br/>

    and gone to empty places,<br/>

    with no trouble<br/>

    attained the stopping of perceiving and feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, Evil One, the venerable Sañjīva was sitting at the root of a certain tree<br/>

    attaining the stopping of perceiving and feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, cowherds, goatherds, yeoman farmers, travellers,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    saw the venerable Sañjīva sitting at the root of that tree<br/>

    attaining the stopping of perceiving and feeling;<br/>

    having seen him,<br/>

    it occurred to them:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed it is wonderful,<br/>

    indeed it is marvellous,<br/>

    that this recluse is just sitting dead.</p>

    <p class="f4">Come, we will cremate him.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, these cowherds, goatherds, yeomen farmers, travellers,<br/>

    having collected grass and sticks and cow-dung<br/>

    and having heaped them over the venerable Sañjīva's body,<br/>

    lit the fire and departed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, the venerable Sañjīva,<br/>

    having emerged towards the end of that night<br/>

    from that attainment,<br/>

    having shaken his robes,<br/>

    having dressed in the morning,<br/>

    taking his bowl and robe,<br/>

    entered a village for almsfood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Evil One, those cowherds, goatherds, yeomen farmers and travellers<br/>

    saw the venerable Sañjīva walking for almsfood;<br/>

    having seen him,<br/>

    it occurred to them:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed it is wonderful,<br/>

    indeed it is marvellous<br/>

    that this recluse who was just sitting dead -<br/>

    that he has come back to life.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It was because of this, Evil One,<br/>

    that the venerable Sañjīva's name<br/>

    came to be Sañjīva, the Quick.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Evil One, it occurred to the Māra Dūsin:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I simply do not know<br/>

    either the coming or the going<br/>

    for it is likely<br/>

    that when they are being reviled, abused, vexed and annoyed by you<br/>

    there will be a change of heart<br/>
