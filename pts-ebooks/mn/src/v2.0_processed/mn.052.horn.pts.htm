    <p class="f4">This, householder, is one thing<br/>

    pointed out by the Lord who knows,<br/>

    who sees,<br/>

    perfected one,<br/>

    fully Self-Awakened one,<br/>

    whereby if a monk dwell diligent,<br/>

    ardent,<br/>

    his mind not (yet) freed,<br/>

    is freed;<br/>

    and also the cankers,<br/>

    by wholly transcending the plane of infinite consciousness,<br/>

    'There is not anything,'<br/>

    enters on<br/>

    then by this attachment to <i>Dhamma,</i><br/>

    by this delight in <i>Dhamma,</i><br/>

    by the destruction<br/>

    of the five fetters binding to this lower (shore),<br/>

    he is of spontaneous uprising,<br/>

    one who attains <i>nibbāna</i> there,<br/>

    not liable to return from that world.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka<br/>

    spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered Ānanda,<br/>

    it is as though a man who was seeking<br/>

    for one opening to (some hidden) treasure<br/>

    were to come at one and the same time<br/>

    on eleven openings to the treasure.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2">[353]</span> Even so do I, revered sir,<br/>

    in seeking for one <span class="f2 g"><b>[18]</b></span> door to the deathless<br/>

    come to hear<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    at one and the same time<br/>

    of eleven doors to the deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">And too, revered sir,<br/>

    it is like a man's house<br/>

    that has eleven doors;<br/>

    if his house were on fire<br/>

    he could make himself safe<br/>

    by any one of the doors.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so can I, revered sir,<br/>

    make myself safe by any one<br/>

    of these eleven doors to the deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, revered sir,<br/>

    members of other sects<br/>

    will look about for a fee for the teacher,<br/>

    but why should not I pay honour<br/>

    to the venerable Ānanda?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka,<br/>

    having had the Order of monks<br/>

    that was at Pāṭaliputta and Vesālī<br/>

    gathered together,<br/>

    with his own hand<br/>

    served and satisfied them<br/>

    with sumptuous foods,<br/>

    solid and soft,<br/>

    and presented each monk<br/>

    with a separate pair of cloths;<br/>

    to the venerable Ānanda<br/>

    he presented a set of three robes<br/>

    and had a dwelling-place<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>

    that cost five hundred pieces<br/>

    built for the venerable Ānanda.</p>
