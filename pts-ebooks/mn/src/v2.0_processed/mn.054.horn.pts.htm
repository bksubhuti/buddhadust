    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Aṇguttarāpa.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Āpaṇa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> was a market town in Aṇguttarāpa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,<br/>

    taking his bowl and robe,<br/>

    entered Āpaṇa for almsfood.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had walked for almsfood in Āpaṇa<br/>

    and was returning from the alms-gathering after the meal,<br/>

    he approached a certain forest-thicket for the day-sojoum;<br/>

    and having plunged into that forest-thicket<br/>

    he sat down at the root of a tree.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the householder Potaliya,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    who was constantly pacing up and down<br/>

    and roaming about on foot,<br/>

    fully dressed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> and clothed,<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    with parasol and slippers,<br/>

    approached that forest-thicket;<br/>

    having plunged into that forest-thicket,<br/>

    he approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br/>

    having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus<br/>

    to the householder Potaliya<br/>

    as he was standing at a respectful distance:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are seats, householder;<br/>

    if you wish,<br/>

    do sit down."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the householder Potaliya<br/>

    thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama addresses me<br/>

    with the word 'householder'",<br/>

    angry,<br/>

    displeased,<br/>

    became silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time<br/>

    the Lord spoke thus to the householder Potaliya:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are <span class="f2 g"><b>[26]</b></span> seats, householder;<br/>

    if you wish,<br/>

    do sit down."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time<br/>

    the householder Potaliya<br/>

    thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama addresses me<br/>

    with the word 'householder'",<br/>

    angry,<br/>

    displeased,<br/>

    became silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time<br/>

    the Lord spoke thus to the householder Potaliya:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are seats, householder;<br/>

    if you wish,<br/>

    do sit down."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the householder Potaliya<br/>

    thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama addresses me<br/>

    with the word 'householder'",<br/>

    angry,<br/>

    displeased,<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This, <span class="f2">[360]</span> good Gotama, is not proper,<br/>

    it is not suitable,<br/>

    that you should address me<br/>

    with the word 'householder.' "</p>

    <p class="f4">"But you, householder,<br/>

    have all the characteristic marks and signs<br/>

    of a householder."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But all relevant occupations<br/>

    have been abandoned by me, good Gotama,<br/>

    all avocations given up."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, householder,<br/>

    how have all occupations been abandoned by you,<br/>

    all avocations given up?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to this, good Gotama,<br/>

    I handed over to my sons<br/>

    as their inheritance<br/>

    all that I had of wealth<br/>

    or grain<br/>

    or silver<br/>

    or gold.</p>

    <p class="f4">Without giving advice or blame in these matters<br/>

    I live on a minimum<br/>

    of food and covering.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This is how all occupations have been abandoned by me, good Gotama,<br/>

    all avocations given up."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But what you, householder, call<br/>

    a giving up of avocations<br/>

    is one thing;<br/>

    but in the discipline for an ariyan<br/>

    the giving up of avocations<br/>

    is another thing."</p>

    <p class="f4">"And what, revered sir,<br/>

    is the giving up of avocations<br/>

    in the discipline for an ariyan?</p>

    <p class="f4">It would be good, revered sir,<br/>

    if the Lord were to teach me dhamma<br/>

    as to that which is the giving up of avocations<br/>

    in the discipline for an ariyan."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, householder, listen,<br/>

    attend carefully<br/>

    and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>

    the householder Potaliya answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Householder, these eight things<br/>

    conduce to the giving up of avocations<br/>

    in the discipline for an ariyan.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What eight?</p>

    <p class="f4">Through no onslaught on creatures,<br/>

    <p class="f4">through taking what is given,<br/>

    lying speech should be got rid of;</p>

    <p class="f4">through unslanderous speech,<br/>

    slanderous speech should be got rid of;</p>

    <p class="f4">through non-covetise and greed,<br/>

    covetise and greed should be got rid of;</p>

    <p class="f4">through no angry fault-finding,<br/>

    angry fault-finding should be got <span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span> rid of;</p>

    <p class="f4">through no wrathful rage,<br/>

    wrathful rage should be got rid of;</p>

    <p class="f4">through no arrogance,<br/>

    arrogance should be got rid of.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the eight things, householder,<br/>

    spoken of in brief,<br/>

    not explained in detail,<br/>

    that, in the discipline for an ariyan,<br/>

    <p class="f4">"As to these eight things, revered sir,<br/>

    which are spoken of in brief,<br/>

    not explained in detail,<br/>

    and which, in the discipline for an ariyan,<br/>

    it were good, revered sir,<br/>

    if the Lord<br/>

    out of compassion<br/>

    were to explain these eight things to me in detail."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, householder, listen,<br/>

    attend carefully<br/>

    and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>
