    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[54]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the Koḷiyans; the market town of the Koḷiyans was called Haliddavasana.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then Puṇṇa, a Koḷiyan who was a bovine ascetic,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    and Seniya who was an unclothed canine ascetic,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan who was the bovine ascetic,<br/>

    after greeting the Lord,<br/>

    sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">But Seniya the unclothed canine ascetic,<br/>

    having exchanged greetings with the Lord<br/>

    and conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    sat down at a respectful distance<br/>

    doubling up like a dog.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br/>

    the bovine ascetic,<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[55]</b></span> "Revered sir, this Seniya,<br/>

    an unclothed canine ascetic,<br/>

    is a doer of things hard to do -<br/>

    he eats lying on the ground,<br/>

    a canine practice<br/>

    which has been carried out in full by him<br/>

    for a long time.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is his bourn,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> what his future state?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    let this be,<br/>

    do not ask me this."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br/>

    the bovine ascetic,<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered sir, this Seniya,<br/>

    an unclothed canine ascetic,<br/>

    is a doer of things hard to do -<br/>

    he eats lying on the ground,<br/>

    a canine practice<br/>

    which has been carried out in full by him<br/>

    for a long time.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is his bourn, what his future state?"</p>

    <p class="f4">[And a second time the Lord responded]:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    let this be,<br/>

    do not ask me this."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br/>

    the bovine ascetic,<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered sir, this Seniya,<br/>

    an unclothed canine ascetic,<br/>

    is a doer of things hard to do -<br/>

    he eats lying on the ground,<br/>

    which has been carried out in full by him<br/>

    for a long time.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is his bourn, what his future state?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Although I, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    did not really countenance your (question) and said:<br/>

    'Enough, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    let this be,<br/>

    do not ask me this,'<br/>

    nevertheless I will explain to you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    someone develops the canine practice completely and constantly,<br/>

    he develops the canine habits<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> completely and constantly,<br/>

    he develops the canine mentality completely and constantly,<br/>

    he develops the canine behaviour<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> completely and constantly.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having developed the canine practice completely and constantly,<br/>

    having developed the canine habits completely and constantly,<br/>

    having developed the canine mentality completely and constantly,<br/>

    having developed the canine behaviour completely and constantly,<br/>

    he, on the breaking up of the body after dying,<br/>

    arises in companionship with dogs.</p>

    <p class="f4">But if he should have a view like this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, through this habit<br/>

    or practice<br/>

    or austerity<br/>

    or chastity,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    will become a deva<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    or a (lesser) deva'.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> -</p>

    <p class="f4">that is a wrong view on his part.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, Puṇṇa, say that there is one of two bourns for one of wrong view:<br/>

    either Niraya Hell or animal birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">So it is, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    that the canine practice,<br/>

    on prospering,<br/>

    leads to companionship with dogs,<br/>

    on failing,<br/>

    to Niraya Hell."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    Seniya the unclothed canine ascetic<br/>

    cried out and burst into tears.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus to Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br/>

    the bovine ascetic:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I did not countenance this (question) of yours, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    <p class="f4">"I, revered sir,<br/>

    am not crying because the Lord speaks thus about me.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is, revered sir,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, this Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan<br/>

    <p class="f4">What is his bourn, what his future state?'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough, Seniya, let this be, do not ask me this."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time Seniya the unclothed canine ascetic spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    pay careful attention,<br/>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir," Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br/>

    the bovine ascetic,<br/>

    answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span> "Puṇṇa, these four (kinds of) deeds<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>

    are made known by me,<br/>

    having realized them by my own super-knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    the deed that is dark,<br/>

    dark in result.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    the deed that is bright,<br/>

    bright in result.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    the deed that is dark and bright,<br/>

    dark and bright in result.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    the deed that is not dark (and) not bright,<br/>

    neither dark nor bright in result,<br/>

    the deed that conduces to the destruction of deeds.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    is the deed that is dark,<br/>

    dark in result?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    someone effects<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> an activity of body<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> that is harmful,<br/>

    he effects an activity of speech that is harmful,<br/>

    he effects an activity of mind that is harmful.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, having effected an activity of body that is harmful,<br/>

    having effected an activity of speech that is harmful,<br/>

    having effected an activity of mind that is harmful,<br/>

    arises in a world that is harmful.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because he has uprisen in a world that is harmful,<br/>

    harmful sensory impingements assail him.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, being assailed by harmful sensory impingements,<br/>

    experiences a harmful feeling,<br/>

    without exception painful,<br/>

    even as do creatures in Niraya Hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span>Puṇṇa,<br/>

    there is the uprising of a being<br/>

    from what has come to be<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span>;<br/>

    he uprises according to what he does<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span>;<br/>

    when he has uprisen<br/>

    sensory impingements assail him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I speak thus, Puṇṇa,:<br/>

    Creatures are heirs to deeds.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This, Puṇṇa, is called<br/>

    the deed that is dark,<br/>

    dark in result.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    is the deed that is bright,<br/>

    bright in result?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    someone effects an activity of body that is harmless,<br/>

    effects an activity of speech that is harmless,<br/>

    effects an activity of mind that is harmless.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, having effected an activity of body that is harmless,<br/>

    having effected an activity of speech that is harmless,<br/>

    having effected an activity of mind that is harmless,<br/>

    arises in a world that is harmless.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because he has uprisen in a world that is harmless,<br/>

    harmless sensory impingements assail him.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, being assailed by harmless sensory impingements,<br/>

    experiences a harmless feeling,<br/>

    without exception pleasant,<br/>

    even as do the Ever-Radiant <i>devas.</i></p>

    <p class="f4">In this way, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    there is the uprising of a being from what has come <span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span> to be;<br/>

    he uprises according to what he does;<br/>

    when he has uprisen<br/>

    sensory impingements assail him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I speak thus, Puṇṇa,:</p>

    <p class="f4">Creatures are heirs to deeds.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    is called the deed that is bright,<br/>

    is the deed that is dark and bright,<br/>

    dark and bright in result?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    someone effects an activity of body that is harmful and harmless,<br/>

    effects an activity of speech that is harmful and harmless,<br/>

    effects an activity of mind that is harmful and harmless.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, having effected an activity of body that is harmful and harmless,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Because he has uprisen in a world that is harmful and harmless,<br/>

    harmful and harmless sensory impingements assail him.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, being assailed by harmful and harmless sensory impingements,<br/>

    experiences a feeling that is harmful and harmless,<br/>

    partially pleasant and painful,<br/>

    even as do men and some <i>devas</i><br/>

    and some in the sorrowful state.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">In this way, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    there is the uprising of a being from what has come to be;<br/>

    he uprises according to what he does;<br/>

    when he has uprisen<br/>

    sensory impingements assail him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I speak thus, Puṇṇa,:</p>

    <p class="f4">Creatures are heirs to deeds.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    is called the deed that is dark and bright,<br/>

    dark and bright in result.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    is the deed that is not dark (and) not bright,<br/>

    neither dark nor bright in result,<br/>

    the deed that conduces to the destruction of deeds?</p>

    <p class="f4">Where, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    there is the will<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span> to get rid of that deed<br/>

    that is dark,<br/>

    dark in result,<br/>

    and the will to get rid of that deed<br/>

    that is bright,<br/>

    bright in result,<br/>

    and the will to get rid of that deed<br/>

    that is dark and bright,<br/>

    dark and bright in result,<br/>

    this, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    is called the deed that is not dark (and) not bright,<br/>

    neither dark nor bright in result,<br/>

    the deed that conduces to the destruction of deeds.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, Puṇṇa,<br/>

    are the four (kinds of) deeds made known by me,<br/>

    having realized them by my own super-knowledge."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br/>

    the bovine ascetic, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is excellent, revered sir,<br/>

    it is excellent, revered sir.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is as if, revered sir one might set upright what had been upset,<br/>

    so that those with vision might see material shapes —<br/>

    even so in many a figure has <i>Dhamma</i> been made clear by the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, revered sir, am going to the Lord for refuge<br/>

    and the <i>Dhamma</i><br/>

    and to the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Lord accept me as a lay-disciple<br/>

    going for refuge from this day forth<br/>

    <p class="f4">But Seniya the unclothed canine ascetic<br/>
