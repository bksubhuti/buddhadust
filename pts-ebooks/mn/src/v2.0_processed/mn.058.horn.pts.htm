    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>

    in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Prince Abhaya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> approached Nātaputta the Jain;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nātaputta the Jain spoke thus<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to Prince Abhaya<br/>

    as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

    refute the recluse Gotama<br/>

    so that a lovely reputation goes forth about you<br/>

    to the effect that the recluse Gotama<br/>

    of such great psychic power,<br/>

    was refuted by Prince Abhaya."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But how can I, revered sir,<br/>

    <p class="f4">"Very well, revered sir,"<br/>

    having answered Nātaputta the Jain in assent,<br/>

    rising from his seat,<br/>

    having greeted Nātaputta the Jain<br/>

    keeping his right side towards him,<br/>

    approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    having greeted the Lord,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Alter looking at the sun,<br/>

    it occurred to Prince Abhaya<br/>

    <p class="f4">"It is not the right time today<br/>

    to refute the Lord,<br/>

    but tomorrow I,<br/>

    in my own house,<br/>

    will refute the Lord,"<br/>

    <p class="f4">"Revered sir, may the Lord consent<br/>

    to take a meal with me on the morrow<br/>

    with three others?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Prince Abhaya,<br/>

    having understood the lord's consent,<br/>

    rising from his seat,<br/>

    having greeted the Lord,<br/>

    departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>

    at the end of that night,<br/>

    having dressed in the early morning,<br/>

    taking his bowl and robe,<br/>

    approached Prince Abhaya's dwelling;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Prince Abhaya<br/>

    with his own hand<br/>

    served and satisfied the Lord<br/>

    with sumptuous solid and soft <span class="f2 g"><b>[62]</b></span> foods.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then when the Lord had eaten<br/>

    and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br/>

    Prince Abhaya, taking a low seat,<br/>

    sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Prince Abhaya, sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, revered sir,<br/>

    could a Tathāgata utter a speech disliked by others,<br/>

    disagreeable to them?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is not this one-sided,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> Prince?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, I, revered sir, approached Nātaputta the Jain;<br/>

    I sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time an innocent little baby boy<br/>

    was lying on its back<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>

    on Prince Abhaya's knees.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus to Prince Abhaya:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What <span class="f2">[395]</span> do you think about this, Prince?</p>

    <p class="f4">If this boy<br/>

    owing to your carelessness<br/>

    or that of his nurse<br/>

    were to put a stick or stone into his mouth,<br/>

    what would you do for him?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I would get it out, revered sir.</p>

    <p class="f4">And if I, revered sir,<br/>

    were not able to get it out at once,<br/>

    then taking hold of his head with my left hand,<br/>

    crooking a finger,<br/>

    I would get it out with my right hand,<br/>

    even though it were with blood.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, I have compassion for the boy."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Prince,<br/>

    whatever speech the Tathāgata knows to be not fact,<br/>

    not true,<br/>

    not connected with the goal,<br/>

    and that is not liked by others,<br/>

    disagreeable to them,<br/>

    that speech the Tathāgata does not utter.</p>

    for explaining that speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is, Prince, that the Tathāgata has compassion for creatures."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered sir, if those who are learned nobles<br/>

    and learned brahmans<br/>

    and learned householders<br/>

    and learned recluses<br/>

    approach the Tathāgata<br/>

    and ask him a question they have constructed -<br/>

    has the Lord already reflected in his mind on this,<br/>

    thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whoever, having approached me,<br/>

    questions me like this,<br/>

    then, asked thus,<br/>

    I will answer them thus,<br/>

    or does (the answer) occur to a Tathāgata immediately?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, Prince,<br/>

    I will ask you a question in return.</p>

    <p class="f4">As it may please you,<br/>

    so may you answer it.</p>

    <p class="f4">What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

    <p class="f4">Are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,<br/>

    I am skilled in the various parts of a chariot."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

    <p class="f4">If those who have approached you<br/>

    should ask thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What is the name<br/>

    of this particular part of the chariot?'</p>

    <p class="f4">would you have already <span class="f2">[396]</span> reflected on this in your mind,<br/>

    thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'If those who have approached me<br/>

    should ask thus,<br/>

    then I will answer them thus,'</p>

    <p class="f4">or would (the answer) occur to you immediately?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Because, revered sir,<br/>

    I am a renowned charioteer,<br/>

    skilled in the various parts of a chariot,<br/>

    all the particular parts of a chariot<br/>

    are fully known to me,<br/>

    so (the answer) would occur to me immediately."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Prince,<br/>

    if those who are learned nobles<br/>

    and learned brahmans<br/>

    and learned householders<br/>

    and learned recluses<br/>

    approach the Tathāgata<br/>

    and ask him a question they have constructed,<br/>

    (the answer) occurs to the Tathāgata immediately.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the reason <span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span> for this?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is, Prince, that the constitution of <i>Dhamma</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/>

    is fully penetrated by the Tathāgata,<br/>

    and because of his full penetration<br/>

    of the constitution of <i>Dhamma</i><br/>

    (the answer) occurs to the Tathāgata immediately."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    Prince Abhaya spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">It is excellent, revered sir,<br/>

    it is excellent, revered sir.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is as if, one might set upright what had been upset,<br/>

    or might disclose what was covered,<br/>

    or point out the way<br/>

    to one who had gone astray,<br/>

    or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br/>

    so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br/>

    even so is <i>Dhamma</i> made clear<br/>

    in many a figure by the the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am going to the Lord for refuge,<br/>

    and to <i>Dhamma</i><br/>

    and to the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Lord accept me<br/>

    as a lay-follower,<br/>

    one gone for refuge from today forth<br/>

    for as long as life lasts."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Son of King Bimbisara.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>cf.</i> <i>S.</i> iv. 323.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>āpāyika,</i> a man in "Misery." These and the following three expressions are also found at <i>Vin.</i> ii. 202, <i>It.</i> p. 85, <i>A.</i> iii. 402, iv. 160, etc. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Vin. Texts</i> iii. 262, <i>n.</i> 3.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>kappaṭṭha,</i> endures for an eon in these states (Misery and Hell), incapable of winning out of them to happier births during this eon, <i>kappa.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>atekiccha.</i> Mrs. Rhys Davids, <i>G.S.</i> iii. p. xiv refers to <i>atekiccha</i> as having "the fearful implication, possibly monkish, of a Buddhist hell that is unending," or, as <i>MA.</i> iii. 108 says, <i>buddhasahassena,</i> while a thousand Buddhas come and go. Certainly the Hell, for Devadatta, endures as long as the <i>kalpa,</i> but the <i>kalpa,</i> as in Hindu philosophy, is regarded as subject to "involution," absorption, rest, before it evolves or manifests again - and endlessly again. Only the major, almost symbolical events are repeated in each <i>kalpa;</i> the details vary, so after this <i>kalpa</i> Devadatta is no longer doomed to states of misery and Hell.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Miln.</i>. 108, 162; <i>K.S.</i> iv. 229, n., "the horns of a dilemma."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> <i>ekaṃsena.</i> No doubt referring to the two-edged question the Jains planned to ask Gotama so as to trip him up. <i>Cf.</i> <i>ekaṃsavādo</i> at <i>M.</i> ii. 197.</p>

The meaning is that in view of this counter-question of Gotama's, the Jains are already defeated as the further questions they had devised would now be meaningless.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> iii. 6. For the opening phrase, <i>cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i. 324, ii. 24.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> The word <i>dhamma-dhātu,</i> as the ultimate principle or own-nature, own-being, self-nature, of <i>Dhamma</i> occurs also at <i>D.</i> ii. 8. It is explained at <i>MA.</i> iii. 113 as <i>dhammasabhāva.</i> At <i>S.</i> ii. 143, <i>Netti.</i> 64, <i>Vism.</i> 486 it would seem to be used in the sense of mental state considered as an irreducible element, <i>cf.</i> <i>Dhs.</i> 67, 69, <i>Vbh.</i> 87, 89. For a more detailed discussion of the Buddha's "power of immediate response," see A.K. Coomaraswamy, Some Pali Words, <i>H.J.A.S.,</i> vol. IV, No. 2, July 1939, p. 188.</p>
