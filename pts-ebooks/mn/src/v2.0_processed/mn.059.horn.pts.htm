    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> Five-tools,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the carpenter,<br/>

    approached the venerable Udāyin<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span>;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    having greeted the venerable Udāyin,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    Fivetools, the carpenter, spoke thus<br/>

    to the venerable Udāyin:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[65]</b></span> "Now, revered Udāyin,<br/>

    how many feelings are spoken of by the Lord?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Three, householder,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    are the feelings<br/>

    that are spoken of by the Lord:<br/>

    pleasant feeling,<br/>

    painful feeling,<br/>

    feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, householder,<br/>

    are the three feelings<br/>

    spoken of by the Lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered Udāyin,<br/>

    three feelings are not spoken of by the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Two feelings are spoken of by the Lord:<br/>

    pleasant feeling,<br/>

    painful feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, that feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant,<br/>

    that is spoken of by the Lord<br/>

    as belonging to exquisite happiness."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time the venerable Udāyin<br/>

    spoke thus to Fivetools, the carpenter:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Three, householder,<br/>

    are the feelings<br/>

    that are spoken of by the Lord:<br/>

    pleasant feeling,<br/>

    painful feeling,<br/>

    feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, householder,<br/>

    are the three feelings<br/>

    spoken of by the Lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time Fivetools the carpenter spoke thus to the venerable Udāyin:</p>

    <p class="f4">Two feelings are spoken of by the Lord:<br/>

    pleasant feeling,<br/>

    painful feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, that feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant,<br/>

    that is spoken of by the Lord<br/>

    as belonging to exquisite happiness."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time the venerable Udāyin<br/>

    spoke thus to Fivetools, the carpenter:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Three, householder,<br/>

    are the feelings<br/>

    that are spoken of by the Lord:<br/>

    pleasant feeling,<br/>

    painful feeling,<br/>

    feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, householder,<br/>

    are the three feelings<br/>

    spoken of by the Lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time Fivetools the carpenter spoke thus to the venerable Udāyin:</p>

    <p class="f4">Two feelings are spoken of by the Lord:<br/>

    pleasant feeling,<br/>

    painful feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, that feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant,<br/>

    that is spoken of by the Lord<br/>

    as belonging to exquisite happiness."</p>

    <p class="f4">So neither was the venerable Udāyin<br/>

    able to convince Fivetools the carpenter,<br/>

    nor was Fivetools the carpenter<br/>

    able to convince the venerable Udāyin.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, the venerable Ānanda overheard this conversation<br/>

    between the venerable Udāyin<br/>

    and Fivetools the carpenter.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    having greeted the Lord,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at a respectful distance,<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda told the Lord<br/>

    the whole of the conversation<br/>

    between the venerable Udāyin<br/>

    and Fivetools the <span class="f2 g"><b>[66]</b></span> carpenter as far as it went.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Although, Ānanda, Udāyin's classification<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> was right,<br/>

    Fivetools the carpenter disagreed;<br/>

    and although Fivetools the carpenters classification was right,<br/>

    Udāyin disagreed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ānanda, two feelings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> are spoken of by me<br/>

    according to (one) classification,<br/>

    and three feelings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> are spoken of by me<br/>

    according to (one) classification,<br/>

    and five feelings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> are spoken of by me<br/>

    according to (one) classification,<br/>

    and six feelings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> are spoken of by me<br/>

    according to (one) classification,<br/>

    and eighteen feelings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> are spoken of by me<br/>

    according to (one) classification,<br/>

    and thirty-six feelings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> are spoken of by me<br/>

    according to (one) classification,<br/>

    and one hundred and eight feelings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> are spoken of by me according to (one) classification.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, is dhamma taught by me<br/>

    according to classification.</p>

    <p class="f4">As dhamma, is taught by me thus, Ānanda,<br/>

    according to classification,<br/>

    of those who will not accede to,<br/>

    approve of<br/>

    or accept<br/>

    what has been well said,<br/>

    well spoken by each other,<br/>

    this is to be expected:<br/>

    that they will live wrangling,<br/>

    quarrelsome,<br/>

    disputatious,<br/>

    wounding one another<br/>

    with the weapons of the tongue.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, is dhamma taught by me<br/>

    according to classification.</p>

    <p class="f4">As dhamma is taught by me thus, Ānanda,<br/>

    and accept<br/>

    what has been well said,<br/>

    well spoken by each other,<br/>

    this is to be expected:<br/>

    that they will live<br/>

    all together on friendly terms<br/>

    and harmonious as milk and water blend,<br/>

    regarding one another with the eye of affection.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Ānanda, there are these five strands of sense-pleasures.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What are the five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Material shapes cognisable by the eye,<br/>

    agreeable,<br/>

    pleasant,<br/>

    liked,<br/>

    enticing,<br/>

    connected with sensual pleasures,<br/>

    alluring.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, Ānanda, are the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever happiness,<br/>

    whatever joy, Ānanda,<br/>

    arises in consequence<br/>

    of these five strands of sense-pleasures,<br/>

    it is called<br/>

    happiness in sense-pleasures.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoever, Ānanda, should speak thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the highest happiness and joy<br/>

    that creatures experience' -<br/>

    this I cannot allow on his part.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, Ānanda, another happiness<br/>

    more excellent and exquisite<br/>

    aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br/>

    enters and abides in<br/>

    the first meditation<br/>

    that is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,<br/>

    is born of aloofness<br/>
