    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>

    in the Bamboo Grove<br/>

    at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time the venerable Rāhula<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> was staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>

    emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br/>

    approached Ambalaṭṭhikā.<br/>

    and the venerable Rāhula.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Rāhula saw the Lord coming in the distance;<br/>

    seeing him,<br/>

    he made ready a seat<br/>

    and water for (washing) the feet.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord sat down on the seat made ready;<br/>

    as he was sitting down<br/>

    he bathed his feet.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Rāhula,<br/>

    having greeted the Lord,<br/>

    sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>

    having put a little quantity of water<br/>

    that was left over<br/>

    into a water-vessel,<br/>

    addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula,<br/>

    see this little quantity of water<br/>

    that is left over<br/>

    and that is put into the water-vessel?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/>

    little is the recluseship<br/>

    of those who have no shame at intentional lying."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>

    having thrown away that little quantity of water,<br/>

    addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula,<br/>

    see this little quantity of water<br/>

    that has been thrown away?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/>

    thrown away is the recluseship<br/>

    of those who have no shame at intentional lying."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>

    having overturned that water-vessel,<br/>

    addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula, see this water-vessel<br/>

    that has been overturned?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/>

    overturned is the recluseship<br/>

    of those who have no shame at intentional lying."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>

    having turned upright that water-vessel,<br/>

    addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you, Rāhula,<br/>

    see this water-vessel that is empty,<br/>

    void?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Rāhula,<br/>

    void and empty is the recluseship<br/>

    of those who have no shame at intentional lying.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rāhula, it is like<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> a king's bull-elephant<br/>

    <p class="f4">-you, Rāhula, could repeat a deed of mind like this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when you, Rāhula, have done a deed with the mind<br/>

    you should reflect on this self-same deed of mind thus:</p>

    a deed of my mind<br/>

    that conduced to the harm of self<br/>

    should find:</p>

    <p>This section has been expanded according to the instructions in the hard copy which simply says "repeat the paragraphs concerned..." However a reader points out that the correct translation should be along the lines of "such mental actions of yours, Rāhula, should be loathed, abhorred and despised. Thus loathing, abhorring and despising, you should acquire restraint in the future." Thank you Epajarjestys.</p>
