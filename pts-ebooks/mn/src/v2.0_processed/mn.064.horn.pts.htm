    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you, monks, remember<br/>

    that I taught you about the five fetters<br/>

    binding to the lower (shore)?"</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the venerable Māluṇkyāputta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, I, revered sir, remember<br/>

    that the Lord taught that there are five fetters<br/>

    binding to the lower (shore)."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But do you, Māluṇkyāputta, remember it<br/>

    as it was spoken by me<br/>

    when I taught you about the five fetters<br/>

    binding to the lower (shore)?"</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, revered sir, remember<br/>

    that the Lord taught that<br/>

    false view of own body<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    is a fetter binding to the lower (shore).</p>

    <p class="f4">I, revered sir, remember<br/>

    that perplexity<br/>

    is a fetter binding to the lower (shore).</p>

    <p class="f4">I, revered sir, remember<br/>

    that clinging to rites and customs<br/>

    is a fetter binding to the lower (shore).</p>

    <p class="f4">I, revered sir, remember<br/>

    that desire for sense-pleasures<br/>

    is a fetter binding to the lower (shore).</p>

    <p class="f4">I, revered sir, remember<br/>

    that malevolence<br/>

    is a fetter binding to the lower (shore).</p>

    <p class="f4">It is thus that I, revered sir, remember<br/>

    the five fetters binding to the lower (shore)<br/>

    as taught by the Lord."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"And about whom do you, Māluṇkyāputta, remember<br/>

    that I thus taught the five fetters binding to the lower (shore)?</p>

    <p class="f4">Would not wanderers belonging to other sects<br/>

    chide<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> you with the simile of the baby?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">For, Māluṇkyāputta,<br/>

    if there were not 'own body'<br/>

    for an innocent baby boy lying on his back,<br/>

    whence could there arise for him the view of 'own body'?</p>

    <p class="f4">A leaning to the view of 'own body'<br/>

    indeed lies latent in him.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Māluṇkyāputta, if there were not 'things'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    for an innocent baby boy lying on his back,<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span> whence could there arise for him<br/>

    perplexity about things!</p>

    <p class="f4">A leaning to perplexity<br/>

    indeed lies latent in him.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Māluṇkyāputta, if there were not 'habits'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    for an innocent baby boy lying on his back,<br/>

    whence could there arise for him<br/>

    clinging to rites and customs?</p>

    <p class="f4">A leaning to clinging to rites and customs<br/>

    indeed lies latent in him.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Māluṇkyāputta, if there were not 'sense-pleasures'<br/>

    for an innocent baby boy lying on his back,<br/>

    whence could there arise for him<br/>

    desire for sense-pleasures<br/>

    among the sense-pleasures?</p>

    <p class="f4">A leaning to attachment to sense-pleasures<br/>

    indeed lies latent in him.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">Māluṇkyāputta, if there were not 'beings'<br/>

    for an innocent baby boy lying on his back,<br/>

    whence could there arise for him<br/>

    malevolence towards beings?</p>

    <p class="f4">A leaning to malevolence<br/>

    indeed lies latent in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Māluṇkyāputta,<br/>

    would not wanderers belonging to other sects<br/>

    chide you with this simile of the baby?"</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, this is the time,<br/>

    Well-farer, this is the time<br/>

    that the Lord might teach (us)<br/>

    about the five fetters binding to the lower (shore).</p>

    <p class="f4">When the monks have heard the Lord<br/>

    they will remember."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda, listen,<br/>

    attend carefully,<br/>

    and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, Ānanda, an uninstructed ordinary person,<br/>
