    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was <span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span> there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, monks, partake of my food at one session.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Partaking of my food at one session,<br/>

    I, monks, am aware of good health<br/>

    and of being without illness<br/>

    and of buoyancy<br/>

    and strength<br/>

    and living in comfort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Come, do you too, monks,<br/>

    partake of your food at one session.</p>

    <p class="f4">Partaking of your food at one session,<br/>

    you too, monks, will be aware of good health,<br/>

    of being without illness,<br/>

    of bouyancy<br/>

    and strength<br/>

    and living in comfort."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the venerable Bhaddāli spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, revered sir, am not capable<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of eating my food at one session;<br/>

    revered sir, if I ate my food at one session,<br/>

    I might have scruples,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    I might have misgivings."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, you, Bhaddāli,<br/>

    having eaten one portion there where you were invited,<br/>

    having taken another portion away,<br/>

    might eat that too;<br/>

    so could you, Bhaddāli, eating thus, keep yourself going."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, revered sir, am not capable of eating in this fashion;<br/>

    even eating so, revered sir,<br/>

    I might have scruples,<br/>

    I might have misgivings."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhaddāli,<br/>

    while a rule of training was being laid down by the Lord,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    while the Order of monks was undertaking the training,<br/>

    made known his inability.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhaddāli<br/>

    did not see the Lord face to face<br/>

    for an entire three months<br/>

    because he was one who did not carry out in full<br/>

    the training under the Teacher's instruction.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time a number of monks<br/>

    were making up robe-material for the Lord,<br/>

    and they said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"When the Lord's robe-material is settled,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    he will set out on a three months tour."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhaddāli approached these monks;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he exchanged greetings with these monks;<br/>

    having conversed in a <span class="f2 g"><b>[109]</b></span> friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">These monks spoke thus to the venerable Bhaddāli<br/>

    as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend Bhaddāli,<br/>

    this robe-material is being made up for the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">When the robe-material is settled,<br/>

    the Lord will set out on a three months tour.</p>

    <p class="f4">Please, reverend Bhaddāli,<br/>

    pay careful attention to this opportunity,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    lest later it is more difficult for you."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, your reverences,"<br/>

    and the venerable Bhaddāli, having answered these monks in assent,<br/>

    approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    having greeted the Lord,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    the venerable Bhaddāli spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered sir, a transgression has overcome me,<br/>

    foolish,<br/>

    and wrong that I was,<br/>

    and when the Order of monks was undertaking the training.</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, may the Lord acknowledge the transgression<br/>

    as a transgression<br/>

    for the sake of restraint in the future,"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed, Bhaddāli, a transgression overcame you,<br/>

    <p class="f4">At that time<br/>

    is born of aloofness<br/>

    and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>kukkucca</i> is scrupulous doubting, doubting whether one is doing right. Bhaddāli says he wonders if he could or could not fare the Brahma-faring for the whole of bis life if he ate thus. He had been a crow in a former birth, and because crows are great eaters he had the nickname of Mahāchātaka, Great Eater, <i>MA.</i> iii. 148 <i>f.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> According to <i>MA.</i> iii. 149 this was the rule forbidding eating at the wrong time (given at <i>Vin.</i> iv. 85).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> See <i>M.</i> i. 477 (and below, p. 151). This and the other six terms (freed through intuitive wisdom down to the one who strives after faith) occur also at <i>M.</i> i. 477-479 and at <i>A.</i> i. 73-74, iv. 10; <i>D.</i> iii. 105, 253-254; <i>Pug.</i> 14-15; and with three others at <i>A.</i> v. 23.</p>

"He should be compared with the person who is freed both ways and the one freed by means of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> <i>MA.</i> iii. 152 says "empty and void because of lack of inner development of the qualities of ariyans."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Vin.</i> i. 315, ii. 126, 192, iv. 18-19, etc. See <i>PTC.</i> <i>s.v.</i> <i>accaya.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> Probably, <i>sikkhāya,</i> the training, should be inserted here as it occurs in all the corresponding passages in this Discourse.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> v. 378.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a></sup> For this passage, down to 'there is no more of being such or so,' see above, p. 12 <i>ff.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a></sup> <i>kāraṇa-karonti.</i> This probably means the juridical action that the Saṃgha (Order) has power to employ. Similarly below, <i>adhikaraṇa,</i> "legal question" refers only to the four types of these that the Samgha is able to deal with. They are treated of in detail at <i>Vin.</i> ii. 88 <i>ff.,</i> and come under "ecclesiastical" jurisdiction only, having nothing to do with a secular court of justice.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a></sup> <i>pema,</i> affection or regard.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a></sup> Lit., "like the eye of one man."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Vin.</i> iii. 10.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a></sup> <i>mahatta,</i> a considerable size. <i>MA.</i> iii. 165-156 says that when the Order has become large, <i>mahantabhāva,</i> then the lodgings do not suffice for the elders, those of middle standing and the newly ordained monks. So conditions causing cankers arise in regard to the lodgings. The rules of training laid down for an Order attained to largeness are (1) "whatever monk should lie down to sleep with one who is not ordained, there is a <i>pācittiya</i> offence" (<i>Pāc.</i> 5. <i>Vin.</i> iv. 16), and (2) "Whatever nun should ordain every year, there is a <i>pācittiya</i>. ... (3) Whatever nun should ordain two (probationers) in one year, there is a <i>pācittiya</i> offence "(Nuns' <i>Pāc.</i> 72,73, <i>Vin.</i> iv. 336, 337).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a></sup> <i>lābhagga.</i> <i>Vin.</i> iii. 10 reads <i>lābhaggamahatta;</i> see <i>B.D.</i> i. 19, <i>n.</i> 1. The conditions causing cankers to arise when the Order has arrived at the height of gains or acquisitions are controlled by <i>Pāc.</i> 41 (<i>Vin.</i> iv. 92, cited at <i>MA.</i> iii. 156): "Whatever monk should with his own hand give solid or soft food to an unclothed ascetic or to a male or female wanderer, there is a <i>pācittiya</i> offence."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a></sup> <i>yasagga.</i> Not at <i>Vin.</i> iii. 10. For this stage in the Order's deterioration the 51st <i>Pāc.</i> (<i>Vin.</i> iv. 110) was laid down: "in drinking strong drinks and intoxicants, there is a <i>pācittiya</i> offence," cited at <i>MA.</i> iii. 156. <i>Cf.</i> <i>lābhagga-yasaggappattā</i> of the Bodhisatta's mother at <i>Jā.</i> i. 51.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a></sup> At this stage there are misunderstandings, and people explain the Teacher's instruction by what is against <i>Dhamma</i> and against <i>vinaya</i>. <i>MA.</i> iii. 156 cites <i>Vin.</i> iv. 135-139, which include the "perverse or wrong views" ascribed to the monk Ariṭṭha and the novice Kandaka (<i>Pāc.</i> 68, 70).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a></sup> <i>rattaññuta.</i> Here, as in the other cases, the reference is to the members of the Order rather than to the Order as a whole. So, here the meaning is "when those who have gone forth for a long time know how many nights it is since they first went forth." <i>MA.</i> iii. 157 refers to Upasena Vaṇganta-putta's offence in ordaining his pupil when he himself was only of one year's standing - he had seen monks being ordained when they were less than ten years' standing. So, "One of less than ten years' standing should not be ordained "(<i>Vin.</i> i. 59), and "One should not be ordained by an ignorant, inexperienced (monk) ... I allow monks to be ordained by an experienced, capable (monk) if they are of ten years' standing or of more than ten years' standing"(<i>Vin.</i> i. 60). As <i>MA.</i> iii. 157 remarks two rules of training are laid down to cover the time of reaching "long-standing."</p>
