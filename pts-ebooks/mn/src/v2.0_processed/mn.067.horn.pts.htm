    <p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">He, gone forth thus,<br/>

    having dressed in the morning,<br/>

    taking his bowl and robe,<br/>

    passion corrupts his mind,<br/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This passage also occurs at <i>Ud.</i> 24-25, where Yasoja is at the head of 500 monks, but the episode is there placed at Sāvatthī, These monks were perhaps only recently ordained, and that is why the two chief disciples were in charge of them. <i>MA.</i> iii. 172 speaks of them as <i>kulaputtā,</i> as though hardly recognising their passage to monk's status. But with this compare the first speech ascribed to the Lord in the next Discourse where he refers to those who have gone forth both as young men of family and as monks.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> No epithet 'venerable' here.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> According to <i>MA.</i> iii. 176, the Elder did not know his duty <i>(bhārabhāva),</i> which was, as was Moggallāna's, to the Order of monks - as shown by the latter's answer; therefore he was commended for it. It is not often that Sāriputta is rebuked by Gotama, but see <i>M.</i> ii. 195, and Intr. p. xxvi.</p>

    <p>There is a difference between thinking 'I will lead the order of monks' and leading the order of monks. There is a difference between giving the leadership to someone and saying that they would or should take the leadership.</p>
