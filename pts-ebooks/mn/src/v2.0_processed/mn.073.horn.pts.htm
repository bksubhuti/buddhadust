    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[489]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[167]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br/>

    having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    the wanderer Vacchagotta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is a long time since I had a conversation with the good Gotama.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It were good if the revered Gotama were to teach me in brief what is skilled and what is unskilled."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, Vaccha, could teach you what is skilled and what is unskilled <span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span> in brief;<br/>

    and I, Vaccha, could teach you what is skilled and what is unskilled in full.</p>

    <p class="f4">But I, Vaccha, will teach you what is skilled and what is unskilled in brief.</p>

    <p class="f4">Listen to it,<br/>

    attend carefully,<br/>

    and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, sir,"the wanderer Vacchagotta answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Greed, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    absence of greed is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Aversion, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    absence of aversion is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Confusion, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    absence of confusion is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three things that are unskilled, Vaccha,<br/>

    the three that are skilled.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Vaccha, onslaught on creatures<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is unskill,<br/>

    restraint from onslaught on creatures is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Taking what has not been given, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    restraint from taking what has not been given is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong conduct in regard to sense-pleasures, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    restraint from wrong conduct in regard to sense-pleasures is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lying speech, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    restraint from lying speech is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Slanderous speech, Vaccha, <span class="f2">[490]</span> is unskill,<br/>

    restraint from slanderous speech is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Harsh speech, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    restraint from harsh speech is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Frivolous chatter, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    restraint from frivolous chatter is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Covetousness, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    absence of covetousness is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Malevolence, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    absence of malevolence is skill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong view, Vaccha, is unskill,<br/>

    right view is skill.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">These are the ten things that are unskilled, Vaccha,<br/>

    and the ten that are skilled.</p>

    <p class="f4">When craving, Vaccha,<br/>

    has been got rid of by a monk,<br/>

    cut off at the root,<br/>

    made like a palm-tree stump<br/>

    that can come to no further existence in the future,<br/>
