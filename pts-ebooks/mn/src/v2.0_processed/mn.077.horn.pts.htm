    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>

    in the Bamboo Grove<br/>

    at the squirrels' feeding place.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>

    a number of very celebrated wanderers,<br/>

    such as Anugāra,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    Varadhara<br/>

    and the wanderer Sakuludāyin,<br/>

    and other celebrated wanderers,<br/>

    were staying in the wanderers' park<br/>

    at the peacocks' feeding place.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,<br/>

    taking his bowl and robe,<br/>

    entered Rājagaha for almsfood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is too early to walk for almsfood in Rājagaha.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to approach the wanderers' park,<br/>

    the peacocks' feeding place<br/>

    and the wanderer Sakuludāyin?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord approached the peacocks' feeding place<br/>

    in the wanderers' park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyin<br/>

    was sitting down with the great company of wanderers<br/>

    shouting out with a loud noise,<br/>

    a great noise,<br/>

    talking various kinds of inferior talk<br/>

    that is to say:<br/>

    talk on kings,<br/>

    thieves,<br/>

    great ministers,<br/>

    armies,<br/>

    fears,<br/>

    battles,<br/>

    food,<br/>

    drink,<br/>

    clothes,<br/>

    beds,<br/>

    garlands,<br/>

    scents,<br/>

    relations,<br/>

    vehicles,<br/>

    villages,<br/>

    market towns,<br/>

    towns,<br/>

    the country,<br/>

    women,<br/>

    heroes,<br/>

    streets,<br/>

    wells,<br/>

    those departed before,<br/>

    talk of diversity,<br/>

    speculation about the world,<br/>

    speculation about the sea,<br/>

    talk about becoming or not becoming<br/>

    thus or thus.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">The wanderer Sakuludāyin saw the Lord coming in the distance;<br/>

    seeing him,<br/>

    he called his own company to order, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good sirs, let there be little noise;<br/>

    do not, good sirs, make a noise;<br/>

    this is the recluse Gotama who is coming.</p>

    <p class="f4">The recluse Gotama wishes for little noise,<br/>

    is trained to little noise,<br/>

    praises little noise.</p>

    <p class="f4">So he may consider approaching<br/>

    if he knows that this is a company of little noise."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then these wanderers fell silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord approached the wanderer Sakuludāyin.</p>

    <p class="f4">The wanderer Sakuludāyin spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let the revered Gotama come,<br/>

    there is a welcome for the revered Gotama;<br/>

    it is long since the revered Gotama made this opportunity!<br/>

    that is to say for coming here.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let the revered Gotama sit down,<br/>

    this seat is ready."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord sat down on the seat that was ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the wanderer Sakuludāyin,<br/>

    having taken a low seat,<br/>

    sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to the wanderer Sakuludāyin<br/>

    as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is the talk<br/>

    for which you are now gathered together here, Udāyin?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span> And what was your talk that was interrupted?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let be that talk, revered sir,<br/>

    for which we are now gathered together here.</p>

    <p class="f4">It will not be difficult for the Lord to hear this talk later.</p>

    <p class="f4">Some time ago,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> revered sir,<br/>
