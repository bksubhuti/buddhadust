    <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_160">Vekhanassa Suttaṃ</h2>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[236]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapinḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the wanderer Vekhanassa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached, <span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span> he greeted the Lord;<br/>

    and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br/>

    the wanderer Vekhanassa uttered a solemn utterance<br/>

    in the Lord's presence:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is the highest lustre,<br/>

    this is the highest lustre."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But why do you, Kaccāna,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> speak thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the highest lustre,<br/>

    this is the highest lustre?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Which is this highest lustre?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good Gotama, there is no other lustre<br/>

    superior to<br/>

    or more excellent than this lustre,<br/>

    it is the highest lustre."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But which, Kaccāna,<br/>

    is this lustre<br/>

    than which there is no other lustre<br/>

    superior or more excellent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good Gotama, there is no other lustre<br/>

    superior to<br/>

    or more excellent than this lustre,<br/>

    it is the highest lustre."</p>

    <p class="f4">"You would be long in expanding this, Kaccāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">You say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Good Gotama, there is no other lustre<br/>

    superior to<br/>

    or more excellent than this lustre,<br/>

    it is the highest lustre.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But you do not point to this lustre.</p>

    <p class="f4">Kaccāna, it is as though a man should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whoever is the belle of this countryside,<br/>

    I want her,<br/>

    I desire her.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Another man might say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My good man,<br/>

    do you know whether this belle of the countryside<br/>

    whom you want and desire<br/>

    is a noble maiden<br/>

    or a brahmin<br/>

    or a merchant<br/>

    or a worker?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Asked this, he would say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'No.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The other might say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My good man,<br/>

    do you know the name<br/>

    or the clan<br/>

    of this belle of the countryside<br/>

    whom you want and desire?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Asked this, he would say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'No.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The other might say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My good man,<br/>

    do you know whether she is tall<br/>

    or short<br/>

    or of medium height,<br/>

    or dark<br/>

    or brown<br/>

    or sallow;<br/>

    or what village<br/>

    or market town<br/>

    or what town<br/>

    she belongs to?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Asked this, he might say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'No.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The other might speak to him thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My good man,<br/>

    do you want and desire<br/>

    her whom you know not,<br/>

    see not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Asked this, he might say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">This being so,<br/>

    surely that man's irresponsible talk<br/>

    does not prosper him?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Certainly, revered sir,<br/>

    this being so,<br/>

    that man's irresponsible talk<br/>

    does not prosper him."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But even so do you, Kaccāna, say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Revered sir, there is no other lustre<br/>

    superior to<br/>

    or more excellent than this lustre,<br/>

    it is the highest lustre.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But you do not point to this lustre."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered sir, as an emerald jewel,<br/>

    of lovely water,<br/>

    well cut into eight facets,<br/>

    if placed on a pale piece of cloth<br/>

    shines and gleams and glows -<br/>

    of such a lustre<br/>

    is the hale self<br/>

    after dying."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>

    which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>

    that emerald jewel,<br/>

    of lovely water,<br/>

    cut into eight facets<br/>

    that, if placed on a pale piece of cloth<br/>

    shines and gleams and glows;<br/>

    or some glow-worm<br/>

    or fire-fly<br/>

    in the dense darkness of the night?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, revered sir, of these two lustres,<br/>

    the surpassing and more excellent<br/>

    is the glow-worm<br/>

    or fire-fly<br/>

    in the dense darkness of the night."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>

    which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>

    the glow-worm<br/>

    or fire-fly<br/>

    in the dense darkness of the night<br/>

    or an oil-lamp<br/>

    in the dense darkness of the night?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, revered sir, the oil-lamp."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>

    which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>

    the oil-lamp<br/>

    in the dense darkness of the night<br/>

    or a great blaze of fire<br/>

    in the dense darkness of the night?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, revered sir,<br/>

    the great blaze of fire<br/>

    in the dense darkness of the night."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>

    which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>

    the great blaze of fire<br/>

    in the dense darkness of the night<br/>

    or the morning star<br/>

    in a clear cloudless sky<br/>

    towards dawn?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, revered sir,<br/>

    the morning star<br/>

    in a clear cloudless sky<br/>

    towards dawn<br/>

    is the surpassing and more excellent<br/>

    of these two lustres."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>

    which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>

    the morning star<br/>

    in a clear cloudless sky<br/>

    towards dawn<br/>

    or the moon at its zenith<br/>

    in a clear cloudless sky<br/>

    at midnight<br/>

    on an Observance day,<br/>

    a fifteenth?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, revered sir,<br/>

    on an Observance day,<br/>

    a fifteenth,<br/>

    the moon at its zenith<br/>

    in a clear cloudless sky<br/>

    at midnight."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these two lustres,<br/>

    which is the surpassing and more excellent:<br/>

    the moon at its zenith<br/>

    in a clear cloudless sky<br/>

    at midnight<br/>

    on an Observance day,<br/>

    a fifteenth,<br/>

    or the sun at its zenith<br/>

    in a clear cloudless sky<br/>

    at noonday<br/>

    in the last month of the rains<br/>

    in the autumn?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, revered sir,<br/>

    the sun at its zenith<br/>

    in a clear cloudless sky<br/>

    at noonday<br/>

    in the last month of the rains<br/>

    in the autumn<br/>

    is of these two lustres<br/>

    the surpassing and more excellent."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Greater than these<br/>

    are those many devas, Kaccāna,<br/>

    who do not share in the brilliance<br/>

    of these moons and suns -<br/>

    that I comprehend.</p>

    <p class="f4">But then I do not say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is no other lustre<br/>

    superior to<br/>

    or more excellent than this lustre.'</p>

    <div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

    <p>This should be:<br/>

    although this lustre<br/>

    is feebler and poorer than the lustre<br/>

    of a glow-worm or a fire-fly,<br/>

    you say it is the highest lustre.</p>
