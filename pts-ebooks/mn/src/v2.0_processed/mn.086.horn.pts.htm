    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[284]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time,<br/>

    in the realm of King Pasenadi of Kosaia<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    there was a robber named Aṇgulimāla,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    a hunter,<br/>

    bloody-handed,<br/>

    bent on death and destruction,<br/>

    merciless to living creatures.</p>

    <p class="f4">Through him villages were depopulated<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    and market towns were depopulated<br/>

    and country <span class="f2 g"><b>[285]</b></span> districts were depopulated.</p>

    <p class="f4">From his constant killing of people<br/>

    he wore a garland of fingers.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,<br/>

    taking his bowl and robe,<br/>

    entered Sāvatthī for almsfood;<br/>

    having walked for alms in Sāvatthī,<br/>

    returning from the almsgathering after the meal,<br/>

    having packed away his lodging,<br/>

    taking his bowl and robe,<br/>

    he set out along a highway<br/>

    towards the robber Aṇgulimāla.</p>

    <p class="f4">Cowherds,<br/>

    goatherds,<br/>

    yeomen farmers<br/>

    and travellers<br/>

    saw the Lord<br/>

    as he was setting out along the highway<br/>

    towards the robber Aṇgulimāla.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having seen the Lord,<br/>

    they spoke thus to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do not, recluse,<br/>

    set out along this road.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is a robber on this road<br/>

    called Aṇgulimāla,<br/>

    a hunter,<br/>

    bloody-handed,<br/>

    bent on death and destruction,<br/>

    merciless to living creatures.</p>

    <p class="f4">Through him villages are depopulated<br/>

    and market towns are depopulated<br/>

    and country districts are depopulated.</p>

    <p class="f4">From his constant killing of people<br/>

    he wares a garland of fingers.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is a road, recluse,<br/>

    along which ten<br/>

    or twenty<br/>

    or thirty<br/>

    or forty men<br/>

    set out only after they have collected together,<br/>

    and even they are at the mercy<br/>

    of the robber Aṇgulimāla."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said, the Lord,<br/>

    having become silent,<br/>

    went on.</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time,<br/>

    the cowherds,<br/>

    goatherds,<br/>

    yeomen farmers<br/>

    and travellers<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do not, recluse,<br/>

    set out along this road.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is a robber on this road<br/>

    called Aṇgulimāla,<br/>

    a hunter,<br/>

    bloody-handed,<br/>

    bent on death and destruction,<br/>

    merciless to living creatures.</p>

    <p class="f4">Through him villages are depopulated<br/>

    and market towns are depopulated<br/>

    and country districts are depopulated.</p>

    <p class="f4">From his constant killing of people<br/>

    he wares a garland of fingers.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is a road, recluse,<br/>

    along which ten<br/>

    or twenty<br/>

    or thirty<br/>

    or forty men<br/>

    set out only after they have collected together,<br/>

    and even they are at the mercy<br/>

    of the robber Aṇgulimāla."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time,<br/>

    when this had been said, the Lord,<br/>

    having become silent,<br/>

    went on.</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time,<br/>

    the cowherds,<br/>

    goatherds,<br/>

    yeomen farmers<br/>

    and travellers<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do not, recluse,<br/>

    set out along this road.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is a robber on this road<br/>

    called Aṇgulimāla,<br/>

    a hunter,<br/>

    bloody-handed,<br/>

    bent on death and destruction,<br/>

    merciless to living creatures.</p>

    <p class="f4">Through him villages are depopulated<br/>

    and market towns are depopulated<br/>

    and country districts are depopulated.</p>

    <p class="f4">From his constant killing of people<br/>

    he wares a garland of fingers.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is a road, recluse,<br/>

    along which ten<br/>

    or twenty<br/>

    or thirty<br/>

    or forty men<br/>

    set out only after they have collected together,<br/>

    and even they are at the mercy<br/>

    of the robber Aṇgulimāla."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time,<br/>

    when this had been said, the Lord,<br/>

    having become silent,<br/>

    went on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The robber Aṇgulimāla saw the Lord coming in the distance;<br/>

    on seeing him,<br/>

    it occurred to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed it is wonderful,<br/>

    indeed it is marvellous.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is a road,<br/>

    along which ten<br/>

    or twenty<br/>

    or thirty<br/>

    or forty men<br/>

    set out only after they have collected together,<br/>

    and even they are at my mercy.</p>

    <p class="f4">And now this recluse is coming along alone,<br/>

    without a companion,<br/>

    it seems from choice.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to deprive this recluse of life?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the robber Aṇgulimāla,<br/>

    having grasped his sword and shield,<br/>

    having armed himself with bow and quiver,<br/>

    followed close after the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord performed such a wonder of psychic power<br/>

    that the robber Aṇgulimāla,<br/>

    although walking with all his strength,<br/>

    was not able to catch up with the Lord<br/>

    who was walking at an ordinary pace.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the robber Aṇgulimāla:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed <span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span> it is wonderful,<br/>

    indeed it is marvellous.</p>

    <p class="f4">Although formerly I could attack and seize a running elephant,<br/>

    I could attack and seize a running horse,<br/>

    I could attack and seize a running chariot,<br/>

    I could attack and seize a running deer,<br/>

    now I,<br/>

    although walking with all my strength,<br/>

    am not able to catch up with this recluse<br/>

    who is walking at an ordinary pace.</p>

    <p class="f4">Standing still,<br/>

    he said to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Stand still, recluse,<br/>

    stand still, recluse."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am standing still, Aṇgulimāla,<br/>

    you too stand still."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the robber Aṇgulimāla:</p>

    <p class="f4">"These recluses,<br/>

    sons of the Sakyans,<br/>

    are truth-speakers,<br/>

    approving of truth.</p>

    <p class="f4">But yet this recluse,<br/>

    while he is walking,<br/>

    says:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am standing still, Aṇgulimāla,<br/>

    you too stand still.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to question this recluse?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the robber Aṇgulimāla<br/>

    spoke out to the Lord in verses:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"While you are walking, recluse, you say:<br/>

    'I am standing still,'<br/>

    and you tell me, who am standing still,<br/>

    that I am not standing still.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">I ask you, recluse, about this matter:<br/>

    How is it that you are standing still,<br/>

    yet I am not standing still?"</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"I, Aṇgulimāla, am standing still,<br/>

    having for all beings everywhere laid aside the stick,<br/>

    But you are unrestrained regarding creatures;<br/>

    therefore <i>I</i> am standing still,<br/>

    you are not standing still."</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Long it is since a great sage was honoured by me,<br/>

    yet this recluse is penetrating the Great Grove.<br/>

    I will soon get rid of evil,<br/>

    hearing <i>Dhamma</i> in a verse of yours."</p>

    <p>The Editor here forgets that this is supposed to be Aṇgulimāla speaking. Perhaps this was not originally in verse?</p>
