    <p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>

    the brahman Brahmāyu had the brahman youth Uttara as pupil;<br/>

    find out whether the recluse Gotama is in fact<br/>

    that revered Gotama of whom the report has gone abroad<br/>

    <p class="f4">Through you<br/>

    will we know that revered Gotama.</p>

    the thirty-two marks of the Great Man are traditional.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    he becomes a king<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> who is a wheel-turner,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>

    the ruler of the whole world,<br/>

    one who <span class="f2 g"><b>[319]</b></span> brings stability to his realm;<br/>

    and he is possessed of the seven Treasures.</p>

    <p class="f4">These seven Treasures of his are<br/>

    the wheel-treasure,<br/>

    not by sword.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, if he goes forth from home<br/>

    <p class="f4">Now I, dear Uttara,<br/>

    you are a recipient<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup></span> of <i>mantras</i>."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very well, sir,"<br/>

    and the brahman youth Uttara,<br/>

    having answered the brahman Brahmāyu in assent,<br/>

    rising from his seat,<br/>

    having greeted the brahman Brahmāyu,<br/>

    keeping his right side towards him,<br/>

    set out on tour (to find) the Lord in Videha.</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking on tour,<br/>

    he gradually approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br/>

    having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br/>

    the brahman youth Uttara<br/>

    looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man<br/>

    on the Lord's body.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the brahman youth Uttara<br/>

    saw all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man<br/>

    on the Lord's body<br/>

    except two.</p>

    <p class="f4">About these two marks of a great man<br/>

    he was in doubt,<br/>

    perplexed,<br/>

    uncertain,<br/>

    not satisfied -<br/>

    whether what was cloth-hid was sheath-cased<br/>

    and whether the tongue was large.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This brahman youth Uttara sees on me<br/>

    all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man<br/>

    <p class="f4">About these two marks of a Great Man<br/>

    he is in doubt,<br/>

    whether what is cloth-hid is sheath-cased<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[320]</b></span> and whether my tongue is large."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord contrived such a contrivance of psychic power<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span><br/>

    that the brahman youth Uttara saw<br/>

    that that which the Lord had cloth-hid was sheath-cased.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>

    having put out his tongue,<br/>

    stroked it backwards and forwards<br/>

    over both his ears<br/>

    and he stroked it backwards and forwards<br/>

    over both his nostrils<br/>

    and he covered the whole dome of his forehead<br/>

    with his tongue.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the brahman youth Uttara:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to follow the recluse Gotama closely<br/>

    so as to watch his conduct?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then for seven months the brahman youth Uttara,<br/>

    like a constant shadow,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span><br/>

    followed the Lord closely.</p>

    <p class="f4">After the lapse of the seven months<br/>

    the brahman youth Uttara set out on tour for Mithilā in Videha;<br/>

    walking on tour<br/>

    he gradually approached Mithilā<br/>

    and the brahman Brahmāyu;<br/>

    having approached<br/>

    and having greeted the brahman Brahmāyu,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Brahmāyu the brahman spoke thus to the brahman youth Uttara<br/>

    as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I suppose, dear Uttara,<br/>

    that the report spread abroad about the revered Gotama<br/>

    was truly so<br/>

    and not otherwise?</p>

    <p class="f4">I suppose that the revered Gotama<br/>

    is such a one<br/>

    and not of another kind?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, the report spread abroad about the revered Gotama<br/>
