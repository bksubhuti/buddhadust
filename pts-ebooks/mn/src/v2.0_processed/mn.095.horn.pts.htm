    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[354]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord, walking on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Order of monks, arrived at a brahman village of the Kosalans called Opasāda.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there near Opasāda the Lord stayed to the north of Opasāda in the Devas' Grove, the Sāl Grove.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">At that time in Opasāda – a place teeming with life, (a place of) grass, wood and water and of corn, in fief to the King – there dwelt the brahman Caṇkī as overlord, on a royal gift, a gift with full powers<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> that had been made to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahman householders of Opasāda heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Verily the recluse Gotama ...<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span>... Good indeed is the sight of perfected ones like this."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then  the brahman householders of Opasāda, having set forth from Opasāda, went in companies, crowds and groups by the northern entrance to the Devas' Grove, the Sāl Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time the brahman Caṇkī was lying down in the upper part of the palace during the heat of the day.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the barman Caṇkī saw the brahman householders of Opasāda who, <span class="f2 g"><b>[355]</b></span> having set forth from Opasāda, were going in companies, crowds and groups by the northern entrance to the Devas' Grove the Sāl Grove; and seeing them, he addressed an adviser, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, good adviser, do the brahman householders of Opasāda, having set forth from Opasāda, go in companies, crowds and groups by the northern entrance to the Devas' Grove, the Sāl Grove?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is, good Caṇkī, the recluse Gotama, a son of the Sakyans, gone forth from a Sakyan family ...<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> an Awakened One, a Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are approaching this honoured Gotama."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, good adviser, approach the brahman householders of Opasāda; having approached, speak thus to the brahman householders of Opasāda:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sirs, the brahman Caṇkī speaks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Please let the revered ones wait; Caṇkī the brahman will also approach to see the recluse Gotama.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, sir," and when that adviser had answered the brahman Caṇkī in assent, he approached the brahman householders of Opasāda; having approached, he spoke thus to the brahman householders of Opasāda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sirs, the brahman Caṇkī speaks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Please let the revered ones wait; Caṇkī the brahman will also approach to see the recluse Gotama.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time at least five hundred brahmans from various brahman districts<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> were residing at Opasāda on some business or other.</p>

    <p class="f4">These brahmans heard that the brahman Caṇkī would approach to see the recluse Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then these brahmans approached the brahman Caṇkī; having approached, they spoke thus to the brahman Caṇkī:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is it indeed true that the good Caṇkī will approach to see the recluse Gotama?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"That is my intention,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> sirs; I will approach to see the recluse Gotama."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do not, good Caṇkī, approach to see the recluse Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is not right<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> that the good Caṇkī should approach to see the recluse Gotama; it is right that the recluse Gotama should himself approach to see the honoured Caṇkī.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the good Caṇkī is of pure birth on both sides, of pure descent from his mother and father back through seven generations, unchallenged, irreproachable in respect of birth.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And because the good Caṇkī is of pure birth on both sides ... <span class="f2 g"><b>[356]</b></span> irreproachable in respect of birth, that is a reason why it is not right for the good Caṇkī to approach to see the recluse Gotama; it is right that the recluse Gotama should himself approach to see the honoured Caṇkī.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the good Caṇkī is prosperous, very wealthy, very rich.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, the good Caṇkī is master of the three Vedas, versed in the vocabularies and rituals together with the phonology and exegesis and the legendary tradition as the fifth; he is learned in idioms, a grammarian, proficient in popular philosophy and the marks of a Great Man.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the good Caṇkī is lovely, good to look upon, charming, possessed of the greatest beauty of complexion, of a sublime colour,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> a sublime stature,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> stately in appearance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the good Caṇkī  is of moral habit, one who has grown in moral habit, he is possessed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> of a moral habit that has grown.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the good Caṇkī has a lovely voice, a lovely delivery, he is possessed of urbane speech, distinct, not mumbling, he is able to make his meaning clear.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the good Caṇkī, the teacher of many teachers, instructs three hundred brahman youths in <i>mantras</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the good Caṇkī is respected revered, esteemed, venerated by King Pasenadi of Kosala.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the good Caṇkī is respected ... venerated by the brahman Pokkharasāti.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the good Caṇkī dwells as overlord in Opasāda – a place teeming with life, (a place of) grass, wood and water ... on a royal gift, a gift with full powers that has been made to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala.</p>

    <p class="f4">And because the good Caṇkī dwells as overlord ... on a gift with full powers that has been made to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala, this is a reason why it is not right for the good Caṇkī to approach to see the recluse Gotama; it is right that the recluse Gotama should himself approach to see the honoured Caṇkī."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said, the brahman Caṇkī spoke thus to those brahmans:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, sirs, hear from me why it is right that we ourselves should go to see the honoured Gotama and why it is not right that the revered Gotama should himself come to see us.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama is of pure birth on both sides, of pure descent <span class="f2 g"><b>[357]</b></span> from his mother and father back through seven generations, unchallenged, irreproachable in respect of birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">And because the recluse Gotama is of pure birth on both sides ... irreproachable in respect of birth, this is a reason why it is not right for the good Gotama to come to see us, while it is right that we ourselves should go to see the honoured Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed the recluse Gotama has gone forth giving up an abundance of unwrought and wrought gold<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span> both in the ground and above it.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama while he was a young man with lovely coal-black hair, endowed with radiant youth, in the prime of his life, went forth from home into homelessness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, although his parents were unwilling and tears poured down their cheeks the recluse Gotama, having cut off his hair and beard and donned saffron robes, went forth from home into homelessness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama is lovely, good to look upon, charming, possessed of the greatest beauty of complexion, of a sublime colour, a sublime stature, stately in appearance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama is of moral habit, one who is ariyan in moral habit, one who is skilled in moral habit, possessed of a moral habit that is skilled.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama has a lovely voice, a lovely delivery, he is possessed of urbane speech, distinct, not mumbling, he is able to make his meaning clear.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama is the teacher of many teachers.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama has destroyed attachment to sense-pleasures, has put away frivolity.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama teaches <i>kamma,</i> teaches effective <i>kamma</i>,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span> desiring no evil for the brahman race.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama has gone forth from a distinguished family, a leading noble family.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama has gone forth from a prosperous family, very wealthy, very rich.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, (people) come from distant kingdoms, distant regions to question the recluse Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, various thousands of <i>devatās</i> have gone to the recluse Gotama for refuge for breathing things.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, a lovely report has gone abroad concerning the recluse Gotama:</p>

    <p class="f4">He <span class="f2 g"><b>[358]</b></span> is indeed Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct, Well-farer, knower of the worlds, the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of <i>devas</i> and mankind, the Awakened One, the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Man.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with his wife and children has gone to the recluse Gotama for refuge for breathing things.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, King Pasenadi of Kosala with his wife and children has gone to the recluse Gotama for refuge for breathing things.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the brahman Pokkharasāti with his wife and children has gone to the recluse Gotama for refuge for breathing things.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, sirs, the recluse Gotama has arrived at Opasāda and is staying near Opasāda, to the north, in the Devas' Grove, the Sāl Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever recluses and brahmans come to our villages or fields, they are our guests.</p>

    <p class="f4">And guests must be revered, reverenced, esteemed, honoured by us.</p>

    <p class="f4">So, sirs, because the recluse Gotama has arrived at Opasāda and is staying near Opasāda, to the north, in the Devas' Grove, the Sāl Grove, the recluse Gotama is our guest.</p>

    <p class="f4">The guest must be revered, reverenced, esteemed and honoured by us.</p>

    <p class="f4">This too is a reason why it is not right that the revered Gotama should come and see us.</p>

    <p class="f4">But it is right that we ourselves should go and see the honoured Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">To this extent I, sirs, know the good Gotama's splendour,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span> but this is not the (full) extent of the good Gotama's splendour – immeasurable is the splendour of the good Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is not right that the good Gotama, possessed as he is of each one of these qualities, should come to see us.</p>

    <p class="f4">But it is right that we ourselves should go to see the honoured Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well then, sirs, all of us will go ourselves to see the recluse Gotama."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahman Caṇkī together with a large group of brahmans approached the Lord; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord; and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the Lord was sitting down talking in a courteous way on this topic and that with a number of venerable brahmans.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time a brahman youth called Kāpaṭhika, young, with shaven head, sixteen years of age since his birth, master of the three Vedas, versed in the vocabularies and rituals together with the phonology and exegesis with the legendary tradition as the fifth; learned in idioms, a grammarian, proficient in popular philosophy and the marks of a Great Man, was <span class="f2 g"><b>[359]</b></span> sitting down in that company.</p>

    <p class="f4">At intervals he interrupted the conversation that the Lord was holding with the venerable brahmans.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord reprimanded the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do not let the venerable Bhāradvāja interrupt at intervals the conversation being held with the venerable brahmans: let the venerable Bhāradvāja wait until the end of the conversation."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said the brahman Caṇkī spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do not let the good Gotama reprimand the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika.</p>

    <p class="f4">The brahman youth Kāpaṭhika is a young man of a respectable family, and the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika is very learned, and the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika has a lovely delivery, and clever is the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika, and the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika is capable of arguing about this speech together with the good Gotama."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Certainly, the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika must be 'finished'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span> in the threefold Vedic lore since brahmans honour him."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika:</p>

    <p class="f4">"If the recluse Gotama catches my eye, then I will ask the recluse Gotama a question."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord, knowing with his mind the reasoning in the mind of the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika, caught his eye.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama is paying respect to me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to ask the recluse Gotama a question?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahman youth Kāpaṭhika spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good Gotama, that which is an ancient <i>mantra</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a></sup></span> of the brahmans according hearsay and tradition, according to the authority of the collections<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a></sup></span> and in regard to which brahmans inevitably come to the conclusion:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This alone is the truth, all else is falsehood' – what does the good Gotama say about this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, Bhāradvāja, is there even one brahman among them who speaks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know this, I see this: this alone is the truth, all else is falsehood'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, good Gotama."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, Bhāradvāja, is there even one teacher of brahmans, even <span class="f2 g"><b>[360]</b></span> one teacher of teachers back through seven generations of teachers who speaks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know this, I see this; this alone is the truth, all else is falsehood'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, good Gotama."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, Bhāradvāja, those who were formerly seers of the brahmans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a></sup></span> makers of <i>mantras,</i> preservers of <i>mantras,</i> whose ancient <i>mantras</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a></sup></span> as sung, taught and composed the brahmans of today still sing, still speak; they still speak what was spoken, they still teach what was taught – that is to say (by) Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṇgirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāsseṭṭha, Kassapa, Bhagu – do even these speak thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'We know this, we see this: this alone is the truth, all else is falsehood'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, good Gotama."</p>

    <p class="f4">"So it comes to this, Bhāradvāja: there is not a single brahman who speaks thus to a brahman:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know this ... all else is falsehood.'</p>

    <p class="f4">There is not a single teacher of brahmans, not a single teacher of teachers back through seven generations of teachers who speaks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know this ... all else is falsehood.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And those who were formerly seers of the brahmans, makers of <i>mantras</i> ... that is to say (by) Aṭṭhaka ... Bhagu, not even those speak thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'We know this, we see this: this alone is the truth, all else is falsehood.'</p>
