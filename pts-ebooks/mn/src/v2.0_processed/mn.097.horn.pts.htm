    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[372]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>

    in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding-place.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta was walking on tour<br/>

    near the Northern Mountain<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    together with a large Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain monk<br/>

    who had spent the rains near Rājagaha<br/>

    approached the Northern Mountain<br/>

    and the venerable Sāriputta;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he exchanged greetings with the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus<br/>

    to this monk<br/>

    as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I hope, your reverence,<br/>

    that the Lord is well and strong?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Lord is well and strong, your reverence."</p>

    <p class="f4">"And I hope, your reverence,<br/>

    that the Order of monks is well and strong?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Order of monks is also well and strong, your reverence."</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is there, your reverence,<br/>

    a brahman named Dhānañjāni<br/>

    near the Taṇḍulapāla Gateway.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">I hope, your reverence,<br/>

    that the brahman named Dhānañjāni<br/>

    is well and strong?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Your reverence, the brahman Dhānañjāni is also well and strong."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I hope, your reverence,<br/>

    that the brahman Dhānañjāni is being diligent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"How could the brahman Dhānañjāni be diligent, your reverence?</p>

    <p class="f4">Under the king's patronage, your reverence,<br/>

    the brahman Dhānañjāni plunders brahman householders;<br/>

    and under the patronage of the brahman householders<br/>

    he plunders the king.</p>

    <p class="f4">His wife<br/>

    who had faith<br/>

    and whom he had married<br/>

    from a family that has faith<br/>

    has died,<br/>

    and he has married another wife<br/>

    who has no faith<br/>

    and who comes from a family that has no faith."</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is indeed bad hearing,<br/>

    your reverence;<br/>

    indeed, your <span class="f2 g"><b>[373]</b></span> reverence,<br/>

    it is bad hearing<br/>

    that we hear the brahman Dhānañjāni is negligent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Perhaps sometime,<br/>

    somewhere<br/>

    we might meet the brahman Dhānañjāni,<br/>

    perhaps there might be some conversation."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    having stayed near the Northern Mountain for as long as he found suitable,<br/>

    set out on tour for Rājagaha.</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking on tour<br/>

    he gradually arrived at Rājagaha.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there<br/>

    the venerable Sāriputta stayed near Rājagaha<br/>

    in the Bamboo Grove<br/>

    at the squirrels' feeding-place.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    dressing in the morning,<br/>

    taking his bowl and robe,<br/>

    entered Rājagaha for almsfood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the brahman Dhānañjāni was having cows milked<br/>

    in a cow-pen outside the town.</p>

    <p class="f4">When the venerable Sāriputta, had walked for alms in Rājagaha<br/>

    and was returning from the alms-gathering<br/>

    after the meal,<br/>

    he approached the brahman Dhānañjāni.</p>

    <p class="f4">The brahman Dhānañjāni saw the venerable Sāriputta coming in the distance;<br/>

    seeing him,<br/>

    he approached the venerable Sāriputta;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Drink some of this milk, good Sāriputta,<br/>

    until it is time for a meal."</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, brahman,<br/>

    I have finished with eating for today.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will take my day-sojoum<br/>

    at the root of a tree -<br/>

    you could come there."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, sir,"<br/>

    the brahman Dhānañjāni answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then when the brahman Dhānañjāni had had breakfast,<br/>

    he approached the venerable Sāriputta;<br/>

    having approached<br/>

    he exchanged greetings with the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus<br/>

    to the brahman Dhānañjāni<br/>

    as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I hope that you are being diligent, Dhānañjāni?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"How could I be diligent, good Sāriputta,<br/>

    when there are my parents to support,<br/>

    my wife and children to support,<br/>

    my slaves,<br/>

    servants<br/>

    and work-people to support,<br/>

    when there are services to perform<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> for friends and acquaintances,<br/>

    services to perform for kith and kin,<br/>

    services to perform for guests,<br/>

    rites to perform<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> for the ancestors,<br/>

    rites to perform for the <i>devatās,</i> duties to perform<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> for the king -<br/>

    and this body too must be satisfied and looked after."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Dhānañjāni?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose someone were a non-dhamma-farer,<br/>

    an uneven-farer<br/>

    because of his parents;<br/>

    because of his non-dhamma-faring,<br/>

    uneven-faring<br/>

    the guardians of Niraya Hell<br/>

    might drag him off to Niraya Hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">Would he gain <span class="f2 g"><b>[374]</b></span> anything by saying:</p>

    likewise the third,<br/>

    likewise the fourth;<br/>

    just so above,<br/>

    below,<br/>

    across;<br/>

    he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br/>

    everywhere,<br/>

    in every way,<br/>

    with a mind of equanimity<br/>

    that was far-reaching,<br/>

    wide-spread,<br/>

    immeasurable,<br/>

    without enmity,<br/>

    without malevolence.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, good Sāriputta,<br/>

    in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head,<br/>

    and say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, the brahman Dhānañjāni is ill,<br/>

    in pain,<br/>

    grievously afflicted;<br/>

    he salutes the Lord's feet with his head.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, although there was something further to be done,<br/>

    the venerable Sāriputta established the brahman Dhānañjāni<br/>

    (only) in the less,<br/>

    in a Brahma-world<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    and, rising from his seat,<br/>

    he departed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Soon after the venerable Sāriputta had gone,<br/>

    the brahman Dhānañjāni passed away,<br/>

    and arose in the Brahma-world.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, although there was something further to be done,<br/>

    this Sāriputta established the brahman Dhānañjāni<br/>

    (only) in the less,<br/>

    in the Brahma-world,<br/>

    and rising from his seat,<br/>

    he is departing."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    having greeted the Lord,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, the brahman Dhānañjāni is ill,<br/>

    in pain,<br/>

    grievously afflicted;<br/>

    he salutes the Lord's feet with his head."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[379]</b></span> "But why did you, Sāriputta,<br/>

    although there was something further to be done,<br/>

    having established the brahman Dhānañjāni<br/>

    (only) in the less,<br/>

    in the Brahma-world,<br/>

    rising from your seat, depart?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"It occurred to me, Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">'These brahmans are very intent on the Brahma-world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose I were to show the brahman Dhānañjāni<br/>

    the way to companionship with Brahmā?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sāriputta, the brahman Dhānañjāni has died<br/>

    and has uprisen in the Brahma-world."</p>
