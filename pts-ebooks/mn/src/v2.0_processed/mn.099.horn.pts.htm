    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    was residing in Sāvatthī<br/>

    in a householder's dwelling<br/>

    on some business or other.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<br/>

    who was staying in that householder's dwelling,<br/>

    spoke thus to that householder:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard, householder,<br/>

    that Sāvatthī is not unfrequented<br/>

    by perfected ones.</p>

    <p class="f4">Could we today<br/>

    pay our respects to a recluse or brahman?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered sir, this Lord is staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove<br/>

    in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">You could pay respects to this Lord, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">When the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<br/>

    had answered that householder in assent,<br/>

    he approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br/>

    having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good Gotama, brahmans speak thus:</p>
