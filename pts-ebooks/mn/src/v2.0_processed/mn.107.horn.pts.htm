    <h2 id="sigil_toc_id_214">Gaṇaka-Moggallāna Suttaṃ</h2>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus I have heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthi<br/>

    in the palace of Migara's mother<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    in the Eastern Monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahman Ganaka-Moggallāna approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br/>

    having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    Ganaka-Moggallāna the brahman<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just as, good Gotama,<br/>

    in this palace of Migara's mother<br/>

    there can be seen a gradual training,<br/>

    a gradual doing,<br/>

    a gradual practice,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    that is to say<br/>

    as far as the last flight of stairs,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    so, too, good Gotama,<br/>

    for these brahmans there can be seen<br/>

    a gradual training,<br/>

    a gradual doing,<br/>

    a gradual practice,<br/>

    that is to say<br/>

    in the study [of the Vedas];<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    so too, good Gotama,<br/>

    for these archers<br/>

    there can be seen a gradual training,<br/>

    a gradual doing,<br/>

    a gradual practice,<br/>

    that is to say in archery;<br/>

    so too, good Gotama,<br/>

    for us whose livelihood is calculation<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    there can be seen a gradual training,<br/>

    a gradual practice,<br/>

    that is to say in accountancy.</p>

    <p class="f4">For when we get a pupil, good Gotama,<br/>

    we first of all make him calculate:<br/>

    'One one,<br/>

    two twos,<br/>

    three threes,<br/>

    four fours,<br/>

    five fives,<br/>

    six sixes,<br/>

    seven sevens,<br/>

    eight eights,<br/>

    nine nines,<br/>

    ten tens,'<br/>

    and we, good Gotama,<br/>

    also make him calculate a hundred.</p>

    <p class="f4">Is it not possible, good Gotama,<br/>

    to lay down a similar gradual training,<br/>

    gradual doing,<br/>

    gradual practice<br/>

    in respect of this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is possible, brahman,<br/>

    to lay down a gradual training,<br/>

    a gradual doing,<br/>

    a gradual practice<br/>

    in respect of this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline.</p>

    <p class="f4">Brahman, even a skilled trainer of horses,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    having taken on a beautiful thoroughbred<br/>

    first of all gets it used to the training<br/>

    in respect of wearing the bit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he gets it used to further training —<br/>

    even so brahman,<br/>

    the Tathāgata,<br/>

    having taken on a man<br/>

    <span class="f2 g"><b>[53]</b></span> to be tamed,<br/>

    first of all disciplines him thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come you, monk, be of moral habit,<br/>

    endowed with [right] behavior and posture,<br/>

    train yourself in the rules of training.'</p>

    <p class="f4">As soon, brahman,<br/>

    endowed with [right] behavior and posture;<br/>

    undertaking them,<br/>

    <p class="f4">"As soon, brahman,<br/>

    as a monk is guarded as to the doors of the sense-organs,<br/>

    the Tathāgata disciplines him further,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">On returning from alms-gathering<br/>

    after the meal,<br/>

    the monk sits down cross-legged,<br/>

    <p class="f4">He, getting rid of covetousness for the world,<br/>

    dwells with a mind<br/>

    devoid of covetousness,<br/>

    he cleanses the mind<br/>

    of covetousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Getting rid of the taint of ill-will,<br/>

    he dwells benevolent in mind;<br/>

    compassionate and merciful<br/>

    towards all creatures and beings,<br/>

    he cleanses the mind<br/>

    of ill-will.</p>

    <p class="f4">Getting rid of sloth and torpor,<br/>

    he dwells without sloth or torpor;<br/>

    perceiving the light,<br/>

    he cleanses the mind<br/>

    of sloth and torpor.</p>

    <p class="f4">Getting rid of restlessness and worry,<br/>

    the mind inward tranquil,<br/>

    of restlessness and worry.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He, by getting rid of these five hindrances,<br/>

    which are defilements of the mind<br/>

    and deleterious to intuitive wisdom,<br/>

    aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br/>

    aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br/>

    enters and abides in<br/>

    the first meditation<br/>

    which is accompanied by initial <span class="f2 g"><b>[55]</b></span> thought<br/>

    and discursive thought,<br/>

    is born of aloofness<br/>

    and is rapturous<br/>

    <p class="f4">By allaying initial thought<br/>

    and discursive thought,<br/>

    his mind subjectively tranquilized<br/>

    he enters and abides in<br/>

    the second meditation<br/>

    and discursive thought,<br/>

    is born of concentration<br/>

    and is rapturous<br/>

    <p class="f4">By the fading out of rapture,<br/>

    he dwells with equanimity,<br/>

    attentive and clearly conscious,<br/>

    and experiences in his person<br/>

    that joy<br/>

    of which the ariyans say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Joyful lives he<br/>

    who has equanimity<br/>

    and is mindful,'</p>

    <p class="f4">and he enters and abides in<br/>

    the third meditation.</p>

    <p class="f4">By getting rid of anguish,<br/>

    by the going down<br/>

    of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br/>

    he enters and abides in<br/>

    the fourth meditation<br/>

    and which is entirely purified<br/>

    by equanimity<br/>

    and mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Brahman, such is my instruction<br/>

    for those monks who are learners who,<br/>

    perfection being not yet attained,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>

    dwell longing for<br/>

    the incomparable security from the bonds.</p>

    <p class="f4">But as for those monks<br/>

    who are perfected ones,<br/>

    the cankers destroyed,<br/>

    who have lived the life,<br/>

    done what was to be done,<br/>

    shed the burden,<br/>

    attained to their own goal,<br/>

    the fetters of becoming<br/>

    utterly destroyed,<br/>

    and who are freed<br/>

    by perfect profound knowledge —<br/>

    these things conduce<br/>

    both to their abiding in ease here and now<br/>

    as well as to their mindfulness<br/>

    and clear consciousness."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    taking the lead in seclusion,<br/>

    who are of stirred up energy,<br/>

    self-resolute,<br/>

    with mindfulness aroused,<br/>

    clearly conscious,<br/>

    concentrated,<br/>

    their minds one-pointed,<br/>

    who have wisdom,<br/>

    are not drivellers —<br/>

    the good Gotama is in communion with <i>them.</i></p>

    <p class="f4">As, good Gotama,<br/>

    black gum is pointed to<br/>

    as chief of root-scents,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/>

    as red sandalwood is pointed to<br/>

    as chief of the pith-scents,<br/>

    as jasmine is pointed to<br/>

    as chief of the flower scents —<br/>

    even so is the exhortation of the good Gotama<br/>

    highest among the teachings of today.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent, good Gotama,<br/>

    excellent, good Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">As, good Gotama,<br/>

    one might set upright<br/>

    what had been upset,<br/>

    or disclose what had been covered,<br/>

    or show the way<br/>

    to one who had gone astray,<br/>

    or bring an oil-lamp<br/>

    into the darkness<br/>

    so that those with vision<br/>

    might see material shapes —<br/>

    even so in many a figure<br/>

    is <i>Dhamma</i> made clear<br/>

    by the good Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge<br/>

    and to <i>Dhamma</i><br/>

    and to the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the good Gotama accept me as a lay-follower<br/>

    going for refuge<br/>

    from today forth<br/>

    for as long as life lasts."</p>
