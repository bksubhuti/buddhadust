    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grovevin Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there<br/>

    the Lord addressed the monks,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered One,"<br/>

    these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, a monk here declares profound knowledge,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br/>
