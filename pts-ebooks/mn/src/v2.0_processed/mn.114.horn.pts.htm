    <p class="f4">Thus I have heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach youa disquisition on <i>Dhamma</i><br/>

    regarding what is to be followed<br/>

    and what is not to be followed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Listen to it,<br/>

    pay careful attention<br/>

    and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>

    these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,<br/>

    one of which is to be followed<br/>

    and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>

    and there is this disparity in bodily conduct.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I, monks, say that vocal conduct is of two kinds,<br/>

    one of which is to be followed<br/>

    and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>

    and there is this disparity in vocal conduct.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I, monks, say that mental conduct is of two kinds,<br/>

    one of which is to be followed<br/>

    and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>

    and there is this disparity in mental conduct.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the arising of thought is of two kinds,<br/>

    one of which is to be followed<br/>

    and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>

    and there is this disparity in the arising of thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the assumption of perception is of two kinds,<br/>

    one of which is to be followed<br/>

    and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>

    and there is this disparity in the assumption of perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the assumption of views is of two kinds,<br/>

    one of which is to be followed<br/>

    and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>

    and there is this disparity in the assumption of views.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the assumption of individuality<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> is of two kinds,<br/>

    one of which is to be <span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span> followed<br/>

    and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>

    and there is this disparity in the assumption of individuality.</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, revered sir, thus understand this to be the meaning in full<br/>

    of what was spoken of by the Lord in brief,<br/>

    but of which the meaning was not explained in full:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,<br/>

    one of which is to be followed<br/>

    and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>

    and there is this disparity in bodily conduct.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This was said by the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">In reference to what was it said?</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of bodily conduct is followed<br/>

    and unskilled states of mind grow much,<br/>

    skilled states of mind decrease,<br/>

    this kind of bodily conduct is not to be followed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of bodily conduct is followed<br/>

    <p class="f4">As to this,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> revered sir,<br/>

    someone makes onslaught on creatures,<br/>

    he is cruel,<br/>

    bloody-handed,<br/>

    intent on injuring and killing,<br/>

    without mercy to living creatures.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is a taker of what is not given;<br/>

    whatever property of another<br/>

    in village or jungle<br/>

    is not given to him<br/>

    he takes by theft.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is a wrong-goer in regard to pleasures of the senses;<br/>

    he has intercourse with (girls) who have a husband,<br/>

    and whose use involves punishments,<br/>

    and even with those adorned with the garlands of betrothal.</p>

    <p class="f4">If this kind of bodily conduct is followed, revered sir,<br/>

    unskilled states of mind grow much,<br/>

    skilled states of mind decrease.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what kind of bodily conduct, revered sir,<br/>

    does a man follow<br/>

    that unskilled states of mind decrease in him,<br/>

    skilled states of mind grow much?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, revered sir,<br/>

    someone, abandoning onslaught on creatures,<br/>

    is restrained from onslaught on creatures;<br/>

    the stick laid aside,<br/>

    the sword laid aside,<br/>

    he lives scrupulous,<br/>

    merciful,<br/>

    kindly and compassionate<br/>

    to all living creatures.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning taking what is not given,<br/>

    he is restrained from taking what is not given;<br/>

    he does not take by theft<br/>

    any property of another<br/>

    in village or jungle<br/>

    that is not given to him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning wrong-going in <span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span> regard to pleasures of the senses,<br/>

    he is restrained from wrong-doing in regard to pleasures of the senses;<br/>

    he  does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by the mother,<br/>

    he  does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by the father,<br/>

    <p class="f4">If this kind of bodily conduct is followed, revered sir,<br/>

    unskilled states of mind decrease,<br/>

    skilled states of mind grow much.</p>

    <p class="f4">When the Lord said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,<br/>

    one of which is to be followed<br/>

    and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>

    and there is this disparity in bodily conduct,'<br/>

    it was said in reference to this.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, monks, say that vocal conduct is of two kinds,<br/>

    one of which is to be followed<br/>

    and the other which is not to be followed;<br/>

    and there is this disparity in vocal conduct.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This was said by the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">In reference to what was it said?</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of vocal conduct is followed<br/>

    and unskilled states of mind grow much,<br/>

    skilled states of mind decrease,<br/>

    this kind of vocal conduct is not to be followed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of vocal conduct is followed<br/>

    and unskilled states of mind decrease,<br/>

    skilled states of mind grow much,<br/>

    this kind of vocal conduct is to be followed.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what land of vocal conduct, revered sir,<br/>

    does a man follow<br/>

    that unskilled states of mind grow much in him,<br/>

    skilled states of mind decrease?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, revered sir,<br/>

    someone is of lying speech;<br/>

    when he is cited and questioned as a witness<br/>

    before a council or a company<br/>

    or amid his relations<br/>

    or amid a guild<br/>

    or a royal family,<br/>

    and is told:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, my good man,<br/>

    say what you know,'</p>

    <p class="f4">although he does not know, he says,<br/>

    'I know,'<br/>

    and although he knows, he says,<br/>

    'I do not know ;<br/>

    although he has not seen, he says,<br/>

    'I saw,'<br/>

    and although he has seen, he says,<br/>

    'I did not see.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus his speech becomes intentional lying<br/>

    either for his own sake<br/>

    or for that of another<br/>

    or for the sake of some material gain or other.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he is a slanderer;<br/>

    having heard something at one place,<br/>

    he makes it known elsewhere<br/>

    for causing variance among those people;<br/>

    or having heard something elsewhere<br/>

    he makes it known among these people<br/>

    for causing variance among them.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way he sows discord among those who were in harmony<br/>

    or foments those who are at variance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Discord is his pleasure,<br/>

    his delight,<br/>

    his joy,<br/>

    the motive of his speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he is one of harsh speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever speech is rough,<br/>

    hard,<br/>

    severe on others,<br/>

    abusive of others,<br/>

    bordering on wrath,<br/>

    not conducive to concentration,<br/>

    such speech does he utter.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he is a frivolous chatterer,<br/>

    one who speaks at a wrong time,<br/>

    not in accordance with fact,<br/>

    one who speaks about what is not the goal,<br/>

    about non-dhamma,<br/>

    about non-discipline.</p>

    <p class="f4">He utters speech that is not <span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span> worth treasuring;<br/>

    owing to its being at the wrong time<br/>

    it is incongruous,<br/>

    has no purpose,<br/>

    is not connected with the goal.</p>

    <p class="f4">If this kind of vocal conduct is followed, revered sir,<br/>

    unskilled states of mind grow much,<br/>

    skilled states of mind decrease.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what kind of vocal conduct, revered sir,<br/>

    does a man follow<br/>

    that unskilled states of mind decrease in him,<br/>

    skilled states of mind grow much?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, revered sir, someone,<br/>

    abandoning lying speech<br/>

    is restrained from lying speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he is cited and questioned as a witness<br/>

    before a council<br/>

    or company<br/>

    or amid his relations<br/>

    and is told:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, my good man,<br/>

    say what you know,'</p>

    <p class="f4">if he does not know he says,<br/>

    'I do not know,'<br/>

    and if he knows he says,<br/>

    'I know ;<br/>

    if he has not seen, he says,<br/>

    'I did not see,'<br/>

    and if he has seen, he says,<br/>

    'I saw.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus his speech is not intentional lying<br/>

    either for his own sake<br/>

    or for that of another<br/>

    or for the sake of some material gain or other.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech,<br/>

    he is restrained from slanderous speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having heard something at one place,<br/>

    he is not one to repeat it elsewhere<br/>

    for causing variance among those people;<br/>

    or having heard something elsewhere<br/>

    he is not one to repeat it among these people<br/>

    for causing variance among them.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way<br/>

    he is a reconciler of those who are at variance<br/>

    and one who combines those who are friends.</p>

    <p class="f4">Concord is his pleasure,<br/>

    his delight,<br/>

    his joy,<br/>

    the motive of his speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning harsh speech,<br/>

    he is restrained from harsh speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever speech is gentle,<br/>

    pleasing to the ear,<br/>

    affectionate,<br/>

    going to the heart,<br/>

    urbane,<br/>

    pleasant to the manyfolk,<br/>

    agreeable to the manyfolk -<br/>

    such speech does he utter.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning frivolous chatter,<br/>

    he is restrained from frivolous chatter.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is one that speaks at a right time,<br/>

    in accordance with fact,<br/>

    about the goal,<br/>

    about <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    about discipline.</p>

    <p class="f4">He utters speech that is worth treasuring,<br/>

    with opportune similes,<br/>

    purposeful,<br/>

    connected with the goal.</p>

    <p class="f4">If this kind of vocal conduct is followed, revered sir,<br/>
