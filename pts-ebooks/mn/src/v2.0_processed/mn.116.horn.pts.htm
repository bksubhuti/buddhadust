    <p class="f4">Thus I have heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>

    on Isigili mountain.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do not you, monks, see this Vebhāra<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> mountain?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span> "There was another designation, monks, of this Vebhāra mountain,<br/>

    another name.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not you, monks, see this Paṇḍava mountain?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"There was another designation, monks,<br/>

    of this Paṇḍava mountain,<br/>

    another name.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not you, monks, see this Vepulla mountain?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"There was another designation, monks,<br/>

    of this Vepulla mountain,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> another name.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not you, monks, see this Gijjhakūṭa mountain?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"There was another designation, monks,<br/>

    of this Gijjhakūṭa mountain,<br/>

    another name.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do not you, monks, see this Isigili mountain?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

    <p class="f4">"This has always been the designation, monks,<br/>

    this always the name<br/>

    of this Isigili mountain.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, monks,<br/>

    five hundred paccekabuddhas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    dwelt for a long time<br/>

    on this Isigili mountain.</p>

    <p class="f4">They were seen<br/>

    as they were entering this mountain,<br/>

    but once they had entered<br/>

    they were not seen.</p>

    <p class="f4">People seeing this, spoke thus;</p>

    <p class="f4">'This mountain swallows these seers' <i>(isī gilati);</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>

    so did Isigili receive the very designation Isigili.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will point out to you, monks,<br/>

    the names of the <i>paccekabuddhas;</i><br/>

    I will relate, monks,<br/>

    the names of the <i>paccekabuddhas;</i><br/>

    and I will speak."</p>
