    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Saṅkhāra</i> is not here carrying any of its more usual senses, but has the meaning of purposeful intellection; see <i>P.E.D.</i> s.v. <i>saṅkhāra.</i> This is recognised at <i>MA.</i> iv. 146 which explains by <i>patthanā,</i> aiming at, wishing, aspiration. This is one thing while "the five things beginning with faith" are another. Both are necessary to assure the bourn, <i>gati</i>.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> iv, 239 for this sequence and for the following passage; but it enumerates fewer classes of devas than does this Discourse.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>āmaṇḍa</i> (not in <i>P.E.D.</i>) explained by <i>āmalaka,</i> the usual word for emblic myrobalan, at <i>MA.</i> iv. 147. Childers and Monier-Williams give the castor-oil plant however for <i>āmaṇḍa.</i> In either case it seems likely that the seeds are being referred to rather than the plants themselves. Pali knows <i>eraṇḍa</i> (Skrt. also <i>eraṇḍa</i>) for castor-oil plant, <i>Ricinus communis.</i> Among the Indian vernacular names for this are <i>amanakkam</i> and <i>amadam,</i> George Watt, <i>Commercial Products of India,</i> London, 1908, p. 915.</p>

At <i>MA.</i> iv. 147 a <i>nikkha</i> is spoken of as worth five <i>suvaṇṇas,</i> and at <i>VvA.</i> 104 as fifteen <i>suvaṇṇas.</i> The value may have changed according to the locality.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> <i>jambonada.</i> According to <i>MA.</i> iv. 147 and <i>SA.</i> i. 125 this is produced by the leaves of great <i>jambu</i>-trees; they fall into the rivers on whose banks the trees grow and gradually reach the sea.</p>
