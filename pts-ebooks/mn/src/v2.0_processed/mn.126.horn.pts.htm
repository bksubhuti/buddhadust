In this one it seems to mean to twirl, to churn. Matthena should perhaps read <i>matthakena,</i> top, summit. Or has some confusion with the verb <i>mathati,</i> to stir, crept in (<i>cf.</i> <i>abhimattheyya</i> in the next simile)? Or should the reading be <i>manthena,</i> with a churning-stick? I have adopted tentatively this last alternative as it makes here, and in the "favourable" simile below, the greater amount of sense.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> This phrase, from "And if," missed out in the text, is needed both for the balance of these expectation clauses and for that of this favourable fire-simile with the unfavourable one, no less than for that of the construction of all the simile-paragraphs.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> iii. 131 (two similes).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> This is a very curious ending to a Discourse, and seems little more than an absent-minded repetition of <i>M.</i> iii. 131.</p>
