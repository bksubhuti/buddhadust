    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[209]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

    in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

    <p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these are the three marks of a fool,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

    signs of a fool,<br/>

    stamps of a fool.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, monks, a fool is one thinking wrong thoughts,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    speaking wrong words,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    a doer of deeds wrongly done.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a fool were not one thinking wrong thoughts,<br/>

    speaking wrong words,<br/>

    and a doer of deeds wrongly done,<br/>

    how could the wise know of him:</p>

    <p class="f4">This fine fellow is a fool,<br/>

    not a true man?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is because, monks, a fool is one thinking wrong thoughts,<br/>

    speaking wrong words,<br/>

    and a doer of deeds wrongly done,<br/>

    that the wise know of him:</p>

    <p class="f4">This fine fellow is a fool,<br/>

    not a true man.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, he who is a fool<br/>

    experiences a threefold anguish and dejection<br/>

    here and now.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a fool is sitting down<br/>

    in an assembly room<br/>

    or by a carriage-road<br/>

    or at a cross-roads<br/>

    and if the people there held appropriate suitable talk about him<br/>

    and if, monks, the fool were one who made onslaught on creatures,<br/>

    were a taker of what had not been given,<br/>

    one who behaved wrongly in regard to sense-pleasures,<br/>

    a liar,<br/>

    and one given up to occasions for sloth<br/>

    consequent upon (drinking) arrack,<br/>

    toddy<br/>

    and strong liquor,<br/>

    and if, monks, it then occurs to that fool:</p>

    <p class="f4">'These people are holding an appropriate suitable talk about me,<br/>

    for these states exist in me<br/>

    and I engage in<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> these states,'</p>

    <p class="f4">this, monks, is the first (kind of) anguish and dejection<br/>

    that the fool experiences<br/>

    here and now.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And again, monks, a fool sees kings<br/>

    who, having arrested a thief,<br/>

    an evil-doer,<br/>

    are meting out various punishments:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>

    they lash <span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span> him with whips,<br/>

    and they lash him with canes,<br/>

    and they lash him with (birch) rods,<br/>

    and they cut off his hand,<br/>

    and they cut off his foot,<br/>

    and they cut off his hand and foot,<br/>

    and they cut off his his ear,<br/>

    and they cut off his his nose,<br/>

    and they cut off his his ear and nose,<br/>

    and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'antelope' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'disc-slice' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'pickling process' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'circling the pin' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'straw-mattress,'<br/>

    and they spray him with burning oil,<br/>

    give him as food to the dogs,<br/>

    impale him alive on stakes,<br/>

    and they decapitate him with a sword.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, it occurs to the fool:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Because of such and such evil deeds<br/>

    kings, having arrested a thief,<br/>

    an evil-doer,<br/>

    mete out various punishments:<br/>

    they lash him with whips,<br/>

    and they lash him with canes,<br/>

    and they lash him with (birch) rods,<br/>

    and they cut off his hand,<br/>

    and they cut off his foot,<br/>

    and they cut off his hand and foot,<br/>

    and they cut off his his ear,<br/>

    and they cut off his his nose,<br/>

    and they cut off his his ear and nose,<br/>

    and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'antelope' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'disc-slice' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'pickling process' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'circling the pin' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'straw-mattress,'<br/>

    and they spray him with burning oil,<br/>

    give him as food to the dogs,<br/>

    impale him alive on stakes,<br/>

    and they decapitate him with a sword.</p>

    <p class="f4">But these states exist in me<br/>

    and I engage in these states.</p>

    <p class="f4">So if kings should know about me,<br/>

    they might have me arrested too,<br/>

    and mete out various punishments:<br/>

    they might lash me with whips,<br/>

    they might lash me with canes,<br/>

    they might lash me with (birch) rods,<br/>

    they might cut off my hand,<br/>

    they might cut off my foot,<br/>

    they might cut off my hand and foot,<br/>

    they might cut off my my ear,<br/>

    they might cut off my my nose,<br/>

    they might cut off my his ear and nose,<br/>

    they might give me the 'gruel-pot' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'fire-garland' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'flaming hand' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'hay-twist' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'bark-dress' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'antelope' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'disc-slice' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'pickling process' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'circling the pin' punishment,<br/>

    they might give me the 'straw-mattress,'<br/>

    they might spray me with burning oil,<br/>

    give me as food to the dogs,<br/>

    impale me alive on stakes,<br/>

    and they decapitate me with a sword.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the second (kind' of) anguish and dejection<br/>

    that the fool experiences<br/>

    here and now.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And again, monks,<br/>

    while a fool is on a chair<br/>

    or bed<br/>

    or lying on the ground,<br/>

    at such a time those evil deeds<br/>

    that he has formerly wrongly done<br/>

    by body,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and thought<br/>

    rest on him,<br/>

    lie on him,<br/>

    settle on him.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, as at eventide<br/>

    the shadows of the great mountain peaks<br/>

    rest,<br/>

    lie<br/>

    and settle on the earth,<br/>

    so, monks, do these evil deeds<br/>

    that the fool has formerly wrongly done<br/>

    by body,<br/>

    speech<br/>

    and thought<br/>

    rest,<br/>

    lie<br/>

    and settle on him<br/>

    as he is on a chair<br/>

    or bed<br/>

    or lying on the ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, it occurs thus to the fool:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed what is lovely<br/>

    has not been done by me,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>

    what is skilled<br/>

    has not been done,<br/>

    no refuge against fearful (consequences)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    has been made,<br/>

    evil has been done,<br/>

    cruelty has been done,<br/>

    violence has been done.</p>

    <p class="f4">Insofar as there is a bourn<br/>

    for those who have not done what is lovely,<br/>

    have not done what is skilled,<br/>

    have not made a refuge against fearful (consequences),<br/>

    who have done evil, cruelty and violence,<br/>

    to that bourn I am going hereafter.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He grieves,<br/>

    mourns,<br/>

    laments,<br/>

    beats his breast,<br/>

    wails<br/>

    and falls into disillusionment.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, <span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span> monks, is the third (kind of) anguish and dejection<br/>

    that the fool experiences<br/>

    here and now.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">He, monks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> who is a fool,<br/>

    having fared wrongly in body,<br/>

    having fared wrongly in speech,<br/>

    having fared wrongly in thought,<br/>

    at the breaking up of the body after dying<br/>

    arises in the sorrowful ways,<br/>

    the bad bourn,<br/>

    the Downfall,<br/>

    Niraya Hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">Anyone, monks, speaking rightly of him<br/>

    would say he is thoroughly undesirable,<br/>

    thoroughly disagreeable,<br/>

    thoroughly unpleasant,<br/>

    as in speaking rightly of Niraya Hell<br/>

    he would say it is thoroughly undesirable,<br/>

    thoroughly disagreeable,<br/>

    thoroughly unpleasant.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, monks,<br/>

    even a simile is not easy,<br/>

    so many are the anguishes of Niraya Hell."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"But is it possible<br/>

    to make a simile for me, revered sir?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is possible, monk,"<br/>

    the Lord said.</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is as though, monk,<br/>

    men should arrest a thief,<br/>

    an evil-doer,<br/>

    and bring him before the king,<br/>

    with the words:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This, sire, is a thief,<br/>

    an evil-doer to you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Decree for him<br/>

    whatever punishment you wish,'</p>

    <p class="f4">and the king should speak thus concerning him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Go along, good sirs,<br/>

    stab<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> this man early in the morning<br/>

    with a hundred spears.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And early in the morning<br/>

    they would stab him with a hundred spears.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then at midday the king would speak thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My good fellows,<br/>

    how is that man?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'He is still alive, sire.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the king would speak thus concerning him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Go along, good sirs,<br/>

    stab this man at midday<br/>

    with a hundred spears.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And at midday they would stab him with a hundred spears.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then towards evening<br/>

    the king would speak thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My good fellows,<br/>

    how is that man?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'He is still alive, sire.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the king would speak thus concerning him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Go along, good sirs,<br/>

    stab this man towards evening<br/>

    with a hundred spears.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And towards evening<br/>

    they would stab him with a hundred spears.</p>

    <p class="f4">What do you think about this, monks,<br/>

    would not that man,<br/>

    while he was being stabbed with three hundred spears,<br/>

    from that source experience anguish and dejection?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"That man, revered sir,<br/>

    being stabbed with only one spear<br/>

    from that source would experience anguish and dejection.</p>

    <p class="f4">How much more then<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>

    with three hundred spears?"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span> Then the Lord,<br/>

    having picked up a small stone the size of his hand,<br/>

    addressed the monks,<br/>

    saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What do you think about this, monks?</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, which is the greater,<br/>

    this small stone,<br/>

    the size of my hand,<br/>

    that I have picked up,<br/>

    or the Himalaya,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> lord of mountains?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This small stone, revered sir,<br/>

    that the Lord picked up,<br/>

    the size of his hand,<br/>

    is insignificant;<br/>

    compared with the Himalaya, lord of mountains,<br/>

    it does not count,<br/>

    it does not amount even to an infinitesimal fraction (of it),<br/>

    it cannot even be compared (with it)."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, monks, that anguish and dejection<br/>

    that that man experiences<br/>

    while he is being stabbed with three hundred spears,<br/>

    compared with the anguish of Niraya Hell<br/>

    does not count,<br/>

    it does not amount even to an infinitesimal fraction (of it),<br/>

    it cannot even be compared (with it).</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br/>

    subject him to what is called the fivefold pinion.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">They drive a red-hot iron stake<br/>

    through each hand<br/>

    and each foot<br/>

    and a red-hot iron stake<br/>

    through the middle of his breast.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br/>

    sharp,<br/>

    severe.</p>

    <p class="f4">But he does not do his time<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/>

    until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the guardians of Niraya Hell<br/>

    lay him down<br/>

    and plane him with adzes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br/>

    sharp,<br/>

    severe.</p>

    <p class="f4">But he does not do his time<br/>

    until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br/>

    place him feet up<br/>

    and head down<br/>

    and plane him with razors.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br/>

    sharp,<br/>

    severe.</p>

    <p class="f4">But he does not do his time<br/>

    until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br/>

    bind him to a chariot<br/>

    and drive him up and down<br/>

    over ground that is burning,<br/>

    aflame,<br/>

    ablaze.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br/>

    sharp,<br/>

    severe.</p>

    <p class="f4">But he does not do his time<br/>

    until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br/>

    push him up and down<br/>

    a great mountain slope<br/>

    of glowing cinders,<br/>

    burning,<br/>

    aflame,<br/>

    ablaze.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br/>

    severe.</p>

    <p class="f4">But he does not do his time<br/>

    until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br/>

    take him,<br/>

    feet up and head down,<br/>

    and plunge him into a glowing brazen cauldron,<br/>

    burning,<br/>

    aflame,<br/>

    ablaze.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he is boiled<br/>

    and rises to the surface with the <span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span> scum.</p>

    <p class="f4">Boiling there<br/>

    and rising to the surface with the scum,<br/>

    he comes up once<br/>

    and goes down once<br/>

    and once he goes across.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br/>

    sharp,<br/>

    severe.</p>

    <p class="f4">But he does not do his time<br/>

    until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br/>

    toss him into the Great Niraya Hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, this Great Niraya Hell<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span><br/>

    (is so described):</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Four-cornered and with four gates,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span><br/>

    It is divided into equal portions,<br/>

    Its incandescent floor is made of glowing iron;<br/>

    All round it stands a hundred yojanas square.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">In many a disquisition could I, monks,<br/>

    but it is not easy to describe in full,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span> monks,<br/>

    so many are the anguishes of Niraya Hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are, monks, animals,<br/>

    signs of a wise man,<br/>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, monks,<br/>

    a wise man is one thinking right thoughts,<br/>

    speaking right words,<br/>

    and a doer of deeds rightly done.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, a wise man<br/>

    how could the wise know of him:</p>

    <p class="f4">This worthy man is a wise man,<br/>

    a true man?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is because, monks, a wise man is one thinking right thoughts,<br/>

    speaking right words,<br/>

    a doer of deeds rightly done,<br/>

    that the wise know of him:</p>

    <p class="f4">This worthy man is a wise man,<br/>

    a true man.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, he who is a wise man<br/>

    experiences a threefold happiness and joy<br/>

    here and now.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, monks, the wise man is sitting down<br/>

    in an assembly room<br/>

    or by a carriage road<br/>

    or at a cross-roads<br/>

    and the people there held appropriate suitable talk about him,<br/>

    and if, monks, the wise man<br/>

    abstained from onslaught on creatures,<br/>

    from taking what had not been given,<br/>

    from wrong behaviour in regard to the sense-pleasures,<br/>

    from lying,<br/>

    from occasions for sloth<br/>

    consequent upon (drinking) arrack,<br/>

    toddy<br/>

    and strong liquor,<br/>

    and if, monks, it thereupon occurred to the wise man:</p>

    <p class="f4">'These people are holding an appropriate suitable talk about me;<br/>

    this, monks, is the first (kind of) happiness and joy<br/>

    <p class="f4">And again, monks, a wise man<br/>

    and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,<br/>

    and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,<br/>

    and they decapitate him with a sword.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, it occurs to the wise man:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Because of such and such evil deeds<br/>

    kings, having arrested a thief,<br/>

    while a wise man is on a chair<br/>

    at such a time<br/>

    those lovely deeds that he has formerly rightly done<br/>

    <p class="f4">Monks, as at eventide the shadows of the great mountain peaks rest,<br/>

    lie<br/>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, it occurs to the wise man:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed what is evil<br/>
