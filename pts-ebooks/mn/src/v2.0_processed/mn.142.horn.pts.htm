    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the Sakyans in Nigrodha's monastery near Kapilavatthu.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Mahā Pajāpatī<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Gotamid,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

    bringing a pair of new cloths,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached and greeted the Lord,<br/>

    she sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As she was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered sir, this pair of new cloths<br/>

    has been cut out by me<br/>

    and woven by me<br/>

    specially for the Lord;<br/>

    revered sir, may the Lord<br/>

    out of compassion<br/>

    accept it from me."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the Lord spoke thus to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Give it to the Order,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> Gotami.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you give it to the Order<br/>

    I will be honoured<br/>

    and the Order too."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered sir, this pair of new cloths<br/>

    has been cut out by me<br/>

    and woven by me<br/>

    specially for the Lord;<br/>

    revered sir, may the Lord<br/>

    out of compassion<br/>

    accept it from me."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time,<br/>

    the Lord spoke thus to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Give it to the Order, Gotami.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you give it to the Order<br/>

    I will be honoured<br/>

    and the Order too."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Revered sir, this pair of new cloths<br/>

    has been cut out by me<br/>

    and woven by me<br/>

    specially for the Lord;<br/>

    revered sir, may the Lord<br/>

    out of compassion<br/>

    accept it from me."</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time,<br/>

    the Lord spoke thus to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Give it to the Order, Gotami.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you give it to the Order<br/>

    I will be honoured<br/>

    and the Order too."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span> "Revered sir, let the Lord accept the Gotamid Mahā Pajāpatī's<br/>

    who looked after him<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>

    and gave him milk,<br/>

    for when the Lord's own mother passed away<br/>

    she suckled him.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And, revered sir,<br/>

    the Lord has been of much service to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid.</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, it is due to the Lord<br/>

    that Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid<br/>

    has gone to the Awakened One for refuge,<br/>

    has gone to <i>Dhamma</i> for refuge,<br/>

    has gone to the Order for refuge.</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, it is due to the Lord,<br/>

    that Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid<br/>

    refrains from onslaught on creatures,<br/>

    refrains from taking what has not been given,<br/>

    refrains from going wrongly among the sense-pleasures,<br/>

    refrains from lying speech,<br/>

    refrains from occasions of sloth induced by intoxicants.</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, it is due to the Lord that Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid<br/>

    is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Awakened One,<br/>

    is possessed of unwavering confidence in <i>Dhamma</i>,<br/>

    is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Order,<br/>

    is possessed of the moral habits pleasing to the ariyans.</p>

    <p class="f4">Revered sir, it is due to the Lord that Mahā Pajāpatī<br/>

    is not doubtful about anguish,<br/>

    is not doubtful about the origin of anguish,<br/>

    is not doubtful about the stopping of anguish,<br/>

    is not doubtful about the course leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

    <p class="f4">So, revered sir,<br/>

    the Lord has been of much service to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid."</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, there are these fourteen offerings<br/>

    graded as to individuals.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift<br/>

    to a Tathāāgata,<br/>

    fully Self-Awakened One -<br/>

    this is the first offering graded as to individuals.</p>

    to a Tathāāgata's disciple<br/>

    who is one perfected -<br/>

    this is the third offering graded as to individuals.</p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift<br/>

    to one faring along for the realisation<br/>

    of the fruit of perfection -<br/>

    this is the fourth offering graded as to individuals.</p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift<br/>

    to a non-returner -<br/>

    this is the fifth offering offering graded as to individuals.</p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift<br/>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift<br/>

    this is the eleventh offering graded as to individuals.</p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift<br/>

    this is the fourteenth offering graded as to individuals.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span> As to this, Ānanda,<br/>

    when a gift has been given<br/>

    to an animal,<br/>

    it is expected that the offering (yields) a hundredfold.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">when a gift has been given<br/>

    it is to be expected that the offering<br/>

    <p class="f4">So what can be said of the stream-attainer?</p>

    <p class="f4">What can be said of the one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of once-returning?</p>

    <p class="f4">What can be said of the once-returner?</p>

    <p class="f4">What can be said of one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of non-returning?</p>

    <p class="f4">What can be said of the non-retumer?</p>

    <p class="f4">What can be said of one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of perfection?</p>

    <p class="f4">What can be said of one perfected?</p>

    <p class="f4">What can be said of a Tathāāgata's disciple<br/>

    who is one perfected?</p>

    <p class="f4">What can be said of one enlightened for and by himself alone?</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And there are these seven kinds of offerings to the Order, Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift<br/>

    this is the first offering to the Order.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift<br/>

    to both Orders<br/>

    after the Awakened One has attained final nibbāna<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span> -<br/>

    this is the second offering to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift<br/>

    to the Order of monks -<br/>

    this is the third offering to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift<br/>

    to the Order of nuns -<br/>

    this is the fourth offering to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift,<br/>

    saying,<br/>

    'May so many monks and nuns be specified for me by the Order' -<br/>

    this is the fifth offering to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">One <span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span> gives a gift, saying:<br/>

    'May so many monks be specified for me by the Order' -<br/>

    this is the sixth offering to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">One gives a gift, saying,<br/>

    'May so many nuns be specified for me by the Order' -<br/>

    this is the seventh offering to the Order.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr" />

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But, Ānanda, in the distant future<br/>

    there will be those of the ariyan clan,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span><br/>

    who will be of bad morality<br/>
