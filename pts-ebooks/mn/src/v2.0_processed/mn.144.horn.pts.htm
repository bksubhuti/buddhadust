    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br/>

    in the Bamboo Grove,<br/>

    at the Squirrels' Feeding-place.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta<br/>

    and the venerable Cunda, the Great<br/>

    and the venerable Channa<br/>

    were staying on Mount Vulture Peak.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time the venerable Channa was a sick man,<br/>

    in pain,<br/>

    grievously ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>

    emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br/>

    approached the venerable Cunda the Great;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    he spoke thus to the venerable Cunda the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let us go on, reverend Cunda,<br/>

    and approach the venerable Channa<br/>

    so as to ask about his illness."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, reverend sir,"<br/>

    the venerable Cunda the Great answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta<br/>

    and the venerable Cunda the Great<br/>

    approached the venerable Channa;<br/>

    having approached,<br/>

    they exchanged greetings with the venerable Channa;<br/>

    having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br/>

    the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus<br/>

    to the venerable Channa:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I hope that you, reverend Channa,<br/>

    are getting better,<br/>

    I hope you are keeping going,<br/>

    I hope the painful feelings are lessening,<br/>

    not increasing,<br/>

    that a lessening in them is apparent,<br/>

    not lessening,<br/>

    an increasing in them is apparent,<br/>

    <p class="f4">I will take a knife (to myself),<br/>

    I do not desire life."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Do not let the venerable Channa<br/>

    <p class="f4">We want the venerable Channa to go on living.</p>

    <p class="f4">If the venerable Channa has no beneficial foods,<br/>

    I will search for beneficial foods<br/>

    for the venerable Channa.</p>

    <p class="f4">If the venerable Channa has no beneficial medicines,<br/>

    I will search for beneficial medicines<br/>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Channa must go on living.</p>

    <p class="f4">We want the venerable Channa to go on living."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Reverend Sāriputta,<br/>

    I am not without beneficial foods,<br/>

    I am not without beneficial medicines,<br/>

    nor am I without a suitable attendant.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, reverend Sāriputta,<br/>

    for a long time have I waited on<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> the Teacher<br/>

    <p class="f4">For this, reverend Sāriputta, is suitable in a disciple,<br/>

    that he should wait on the Teacher<br/>

    with satisfaction (to him),<br/>

    not with lack of satisfaction (to him).</p>

    if there is no deceasing and uprising,<br/>

    there is no "here" itself<br/>

    nor "yonder"<br/>

    nor "in between the two."<br/>

    This is itself the end of anguish.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta<br/>

    and the venerable Cunda the Great,<br/>

    families to be visited.</p>

    <p class="f4">As far as this, Sāriputta,<br/>

    I do not say he was to be blamed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But whoever, <span class="f2 g"><b>[319]</b></span> Sāriputta,<br/>

    and grasps after another body,<br/>

    of him I say he is to be blamed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">The monk Channa did not do this;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a></sup></span><br/>

    the monk Channa took the knife (to himself) without incurring blame."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Delighted, the venerable Sāriputta<br/>

    rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
