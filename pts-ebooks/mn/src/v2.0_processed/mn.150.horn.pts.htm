    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[339]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time, the Lord,<br/>

    walking on tour among the Kosalans<br/>

    together with a large Order of monks,<br/>

    arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans called Nagaravinda.</p>

    <p class="f4">The brahman householders of Nagaravinda heard it said that</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed, the recluse Gotama,<br/>

    gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br/>

    and walking on tour among the Kosalans<br/>

    together with a large Order of monks,<br/>

    has arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans called Nagaravinda.</p>

    <p class="f4">A lovely reputation concerning the recluse Gotama has gone abroad thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He is indeed Lord,<br/>

    perfected one,<br/>

    fully Self-Awakened One,<br/>

    endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,<br/>

    Well-farer,<br/>

    knower of the worlds,<br/>

    the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>

    teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>

    the Awakened One,<br/>

    the Lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having realized through his own super-knowledge,<br/>

    he makes known this world<br/>

    together with devas<br/>

    including the Māras and the Brahmās;<br/>

    creatures<br/>

    together with recluses and brahmans,<br/>

    with devas and mankind.</p>

    <p class="f4">He teaches <i>Dhamma</i><br/>

    that is lovely at the beginning,<br/>

    lovely in the middle<br/>

    and lovely at the ending;<br/>

    he explains with the spirit and the letter<br/>

    the Brahma-faring<br/>

    completely fulfilled<br/>

    and wholly purified.</p>

    <p class="f4">Good indeed is the sight<br/>

    of perfected ones such as this."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahman householders of Nagaravinda<br/>

    approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached him,<br/>

    some exchanged greetings with the Lord<br/>

    and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br/>

    they sat down at a respectful distance;<br/>

    some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br/>

    sat down at a respectful distance;<br/>

    some, having informed <span class="f2 g"><b>[340]</b></span> the Lord of their names and clans,<br/>

    sat down at a respectful distance;<br/>

    some, becoming silent,<br/>

    sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br/>

    to the brahman householders of Nagaravinda<br/>

    as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

    <p class="f4">"If, householders,<br/>

    wanderers belonging to other sects<br/>

    should question you thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Householders,<br/>

    or are practising for the driving out of confusion.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If you, householders, are questioned thus,<br/>

    you could answer those wanderers belonging to other sects thus."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the brahman householders of Nagaravinda<br/>

    spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama,<br/>

    it is excellent, good Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br/>

    one might set upright what had been upset,<br/>

    or might disclose what was covered,<br/>

    or point out the way<br/>

    to one who had gone astray,<br/>

    or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br/>

    so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br/>

    even so is <i>Dhamma</i> made clear<br/>

    in many a figure by the good Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">We are going to the revered Gotama for refuge,<br/>

    and to <i>Dhamma</i><br/>

    and to the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the revered Gotama accept us<br/>

    as a lay-follower,<br/>

    going for refuge from this day forth<br/>

    for as long as life lasts."</p>

The householders, on the other hand, appear to address the wanderers both as <i>āvuso,</i> "your reverences" (a few lines lower down) and as <i>āyasmanto.</i> The question: What grounds do the venerable ones have ... by which you, venerable ones, should speak thus; <i>yena tumhe āyasmanto evaṃ vadetha,</i> is balanced by the answer: These, your reverences, are the grounds ... by which we, venerable ones, speak thus, <i>yena mayaṃ āyasmanto evaṃ vadema.</i></p>
