    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[346]</b></span> <span class="f2">[298]</span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Kajaṇgalā in the Mukhelu Grove.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahman youth Uttara,<br/>

    a pupil of Pārāsariya,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

    approached the Lord;<br/>

    having approached <span class="f2 g"><b>[347]</b></span> him,<br/>

    he exchanged greetings with the Lord,<br/>

    and when he had conversed in a friendly and courteous way<br/>

    he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br/>

    to the brahman youth Uttara,<br/>

    a pupil of Pārāsariya,<br/>

    as he was sitting down<br/>

    at a respectful distance:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Uttara, does Pārāsariya the brahman teach<br/>

    the development of the sense-organs<br/>

    to his disciples?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good Gotama, the brahman Pārāsariya teaches<br/>

    the development of the sense-organs<br/>

    to his disciples."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But in what way, Uttara,<br/>

    does Pārāsariya the brahman teach<br/>

    the development of the sense-organs<br/>

    to his disciples?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to this, good Gotama,<br/>

    one should not see material shapes with the eye,<br/>

    one should not hear sounds with the ear.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is thus, good Gotama,<br/>

    that the brahman Pārāsariya teaches<br/>

    the development of the sense-organs<br/>

    to his disciples."</p>

    <p class="f4">"This being so, Uttara,<br/>

    then according to what Pārāsariya the brahman says<br/>

    a blind man must have his sense-organ developed,<br/>

    a deaf man must have his sense-organ developed.</p>

    <p class="f4">For a blind man, Uttara,<br/>

    does not see material shape with his eye,<br/>

    nor does a deaf man hear a sound with his ear."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/>

    the brahman youth Uttara,<br/>

    a pupil of Pārāsariya,<br/>

    sat silent, ashamed,<br/>

    his shoulders drooped,<br/>

    his face downcast,<br/>

    brooding,<br/>

    speechless.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br/>

    knowing that Uttara,<br/>

    a pupil of Pārāsariya,<br/>

    was sitting silent, ashamed,<br/>

    his shoulders drooped,<br/>

    his face downcast,<br/>

    brooding,<br/>

    speechless,<br/>

    addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Ānanda, the brahman Pārāsariya teaches his disciples<br/>

    the development of the sense-organs in one way;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>

    but in the discipline for an ariyan<br/>

    the incomparable development of the sense-organs<br/>

    is otherwise."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4a" href="#n4a">4a</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"It is the right time for this, Lord,<br/>

    it is the right time for this, Well-farer,<br/>

    that the Lord <span class="f2">[299]</span> should teach<br/>

    the incomparable development of the sense-organs<br/>

    (as it is) in the discipline for an ariyan.<br/>

    When the monks have heard the Lord,<br/>

    they will remember."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda,<br/>

    listen, attend carefully and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br/>

    the venerable Ānanda answered the Lord in assent.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"And what, Ānanda,<br/>

    is the incomparable development of the sense-organs<br/>

    in the discipline for an ariyan?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to this, Ānanda,<br/>

    when a monk has seen a material shape with the eye<br/>

    there arises what is liked,<br/>

    there arises what is disliked,<br/>

    there arises what is both <span class="f2 g"><b>[348]</b></span> liked and disliked.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He comprehends thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This that is liked is arising in me,<br/>

    this that is disliked is arising,<br/>

    this that is both liked and disliked is arising,<br/>

    and this that arises,<br/>

    because it is constructed,<br/>

    is gross.</p>

    <p class="f4">(But) this is the real,<br/>

    this the excellent,<br/>

    that is to say equanimity.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So whether what is arising in him<br/>

    is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,<br/>

    it is (all the same) stopped in him,<br/>

    and equanimity remains.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Ānanda, it is as if a man with vision,<br/>

    having opened his eyes<br/>

    should close them,<br/>

    or having closed them<br/>

    should open them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, Ānanda,<br/>

    such is the speed,<br/>

    such the swiftness,<br/>

    such the ease<br/>

    with which anything that has arisen,<br/>

    whether it is liked, disliked or both liked and disliked,<br/>

    is (all the same) stopped in him,<br/>

    and equanimity remains.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the discipline for an ariyan, Ānanda,<br/>

    this is called<br/>

    the incomparable development of the sense-organs<br/>

    in regard to material shapes<br/>

    cognisable by the eye.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

    <p class="f4">And again, Ānanda,<br/>

    when a monk has heard a sound with the ear<br/>

    there arises what is liked,<br/>

    <p class="f4">Ānanda, as a strong man<br/>

    can snap his fingers with ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, Ānanda,<br/>

    such is the speed,<br/>

    and do not remain.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, Ānanda,<br/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> One of the chief difficulties in this Discourse is the translation of the terms <i>indriya</i> and <i>bhāvanā.</i> The term <i>indriya</i> might be rendered "controlling faculties," as it appears to mean at <i>Vin.</i> i. 294 and which is apparently the only other canonical passage where the compound <i>indriyabhāvanā</i> occurs as such, although there is also a <i>M.</i> context (iii. 81) where we find <i>pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ bhāvanānuyogaṃ,</i> the practice of the development (or, mind-development) of the five controlling faculties: of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom. Since, in these two passages, the <i>indriyas</i> are associated at least with some (<i>Vin.</i> i. 294), if not all (<i>M.</i> iii. 81 <i>f.</i>) of the seven groups of the <i>bodhipakkhiyadhammā</i> (things helpful to enlightenment), it may be assumed that in such contexts <i>indriya</i> means controlling faculty. But on the other hand, <i>indriya</i> can also mean sense-organ, and I believe that, from the internal evidence of this Discourse, it has this meaning here. One may usefully <i>cf.</i> <i>S.</i> v. 73 <i>f.</i> which is partially concerned with <i>indriyasaṃvara,</i> control of the sense-organs of eye, etc., for this is a passage that states that whether the material shapes that a monk sees are liked or disliked, he remains unmoved (or, stands firm, <i>ṭhita</i>) in body and mind, his mind inwardly well established, <i>susaṇṭhita,</i> and freed. And this is presumably tantamount to the "equanimity remains," <i>upekhā saṇṭhāti,</i> of our <i>M.</i> Sta.<br/>

    <i>Bhāvanā,</i> the second part of the compound, means developing or producing, with a strong secondary implication that such developing is done by the mind, and is therefore a mind-development such as gives the ariyan control over the sense-data he perceives so that, if he wish, he may abide not perceiving their impurity, etc., but with equanimity in regard to their impingement on him. He therefore trains his sense-organs not to respond in wrong ways to sensory stimuli, and develops such control over them that he will remain unaffected by them and indifferent as to whether he likes them, dislikes them or neither dislikes nor likes. That the impingement of sense-data is inevitable while a man is still alive is nowhere denied in the Pall canon; but response to them, even noticing them may be stopped in deep meditation where all is stilled.</p>
