    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Devatā The term, literally 'deity,' refers to a being differing only in details of physical constitution, and in habitat from a human being, and may mean either a <i>deva, devaputta,</i> or a <i>devadhītā</i> (daughter of the gods, goddess; see below I, 4, § 9). [?] This deva, says the commentatarial tradition, is one who in past ages had beheld, since the last Buddha, Kassapa, passed away, no other like him till this occasion. His beauty <i>(abhikkantavaṇṇa)</i> lay in the luminance emitted by his skin. As a Rūpa-world or higher heaven) deva, he had to assume a grosser materialization than a lower deva need do, or he could not have moved in this atmosphere (<i>cf.</i> <i>Dialogues of the Buddha,</i> ii, 244). Devas usually visited Buddhas and their disciples just before dawn. <i>Comy.</i> JetaGrove, presented by Anāthapiṇḍika the merchant millionaire, to the Buddha, implies the vihāra built there. This has been recently excavated.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> So named after the simile in Sutta 10, p. 8: 'a tender reed.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Mārisa.</i> B. assigns to this word the meaning <i>niddukkha,</i> 'sorrowless one,' and calls it a kindly fashion (<i>piya-samudācāra)</i> of address customary among devas.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>I.e.</i> the fourfold wave of craving for sensual joys, rebirth, erroneous opinions, and ignorance-begotten desires. <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> The Buddhas, says B., teach either by reproving or by encouraging. This deva is conceited, deeming he knows all about the saintship of a Buddha. Hence he is reproved by an enigmatic reply, forcing him to put a further question.<br/> The key to the little riddle is, that a wrong support of footing, and misdirected effort are as fatal as drowning straight away. 'Nor unstayed, nor without effort, absolutely, but rightly stayed with right effort, did I cross.' ... The <i>Comy.</i> names seven pairs of wrong supports and efforts.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Nibbuyhāmi.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Some Singh. MSS. read <i>passāma</i> 'we behold.' His beholding includes spiritual discernment, says B.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>Brāhmaṇa,</i> with all <i>kilesa's</i> (passions) extinct.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> B. here drops the false etymology of <i>visa,</i> 'poison,' in <i>visattika Attasālinī,</i> 264), and calls craving (<i>taṇhā</i>) the cause of <i>cleaving āsatta-visattanādīhi kāraṇehi; /saj</i>).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> Keeping his right side toward the saluted one as he passes round and away — a mark of respect.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> Lit. 'just there' 'There and then' is our equivalent idiom.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> These three terms <i>nimokkha, pamokkha, viveka</i> — are <i>exegetically</i> identified by B. with the Path, Fruition, and Nibbāna respectively, or all three of them, with Nibbāna alone. The deliverance is from <i>kilesa's</i> — let us say 'sin' — the 'detachment' is from misery, sorrow.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> <i>Nandi,</i> 'delight-in,' is the root, <i>bhava,</i> 'becoming,' is the <i>kamma-bhava,</i> or activities, whence comes rebirth. B. sees in these, and in the next two lines, as he is apt to do, a statement of the four 'khandhas' making up our mental personality.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> The text leaves us to apply the introductory description as in §§1, 2.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a></sup> The verb is in either the middle or passive voice: <i>approaches</i> death, as cattle <i>are led</i> by the cowherd. <i>Comy. Cf.</i> <i>Dhammapada,</i> 135. The verses recur below II, 2, §9; the former half occur <i>A.</i> i, 155; the first quarter, <i>Jātaka</i> iv, 398.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a></sup> A span of life is short as a whole and also in its component procedure, for at every moment of consciousness a being ceases and is reborn: such is the gist of B.'s discursus here. The deva, he thinks, considers his own heaven as a 'bait' to stimulate deeds of merit. The rejoinder sweeps aside all heavens.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a></sup> 'The final peace (<i>accanta-santi</i>) termed Nibbāna. <i>Pekkho:</i> wishing for, aspiring to.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a></sup> <i>Dhammapada,</i> 370; <i>Theragāthā,</i> 15. The four Fives are by B. explained as in the Commentaries on these works, viz.: (1) the first 'five fetters,' (2) the second do., do.; (3) the five spiritual powers; (4) the five ties (sangā). See <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 20, n.2. <i>Cf.</i> Also Rhys David's <i>American Lectures</i>, 1896, pp. 142-50.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a></sup> This riddle is held to refer to the Five Hindrances and the Five Spiritual Powers, which sleep and wake respectively, and soil or cleanse, according to the spiritual health of the individual. 'Dust' (<i>raja</i>) is always symbolical of worldly interests. <i>Cf.</i> below, VI, 1, § 1.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a></sup> <i>Nāṇena paṭividdhā.</i> By an exegetical pun, B. indicates the <i>intuitional</i> nature of the cognitive act in <i>paṭividitā.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a></sup> The wholly awake, the rightly <i>buddhā,</i> says B., are the enlightened who are (1) omniscient, (2) paccheka (i.e. cannot save others), (3) masters of the four truths, (4) learned. The lines refer to the first three.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a></sup> Lit. 'Walk evenly in the uneven.' 'The uneven' may refer to one's environment, one's sphere of being, or to moral corruptions. <i>Comy.</i> Thus in <i>A</i>. i, 35; iii, 50, it is rough or inaccessible places; ii, 74 <i>f.</i> astronomical irregularities; i, 154, conduct. <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i, 36; <i>S.</i> iv, 117.

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a></sup> <i>Sucetaso:</i> 'A beautiful consciousness conjoined with insight.' <i>Comy.</i> B. has here a discursus making out that the first three phrases refer to the three-fold <i>sikkhā,</i> or training in ethics, mental control, and insight (<i>cf.
