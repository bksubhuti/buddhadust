So seated, he spake to the Exalted One, telling him of the fairy's interview after his bathe in the Tapodā, and of his reply, and of the fairy's further questioning, and of her fear of not gaining access.

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Nandānā,</i> corresponding in meaning to a paradise: the grove in Sakka's or Tāvatiṅsa heaven, lowest of the deva-worlds (alluded to both as of the Thirty-three, and the Thrice ten; <i>cf.</i> <i>Dialogues</i> ii, 241 <i>f.;</i> <i>Pss. of the Sisters,</i> vers. 121, 181). We have no list of the 33; there were hosts of retinue-devas. According to tradition, devas were sent to the park by Sakka, when their decease was imminent, there to dissolve like snow, or like a windblown lamp-flame, and be reborn.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Accharā:</i> 'daughters of devas.' <i>(Comy.)</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Sankhārā:</i> everything belonging to life or the universe, living activities, natural processes. All deva-worlds are included. These famous lines recur below, IX, 6, and in VI, 2, §5, are put into the mouth of Sakka (<i>cf.</i> <i>Dialogues</i> ii, 176).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Vūpasamo</i> expresses both 'mastery' and 'peace.' A synonym for Nibbāna, says B.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Upadhīhi;</i> not usually rendered as above. Meaning 'bases, or substrate of rebirth,' it refers to such dispositions in character and conduct as form those bases, in other words, the common life of sense and desire. Thus the <i>Comy.</i> paraphrases it here by <i>pañcakāmaguṇā</i> (<i>cf.</i> §I: "sensuous enjoyment"), but in IV, 1, §6, by the five <i>khandhas</i> (mind and body). The term became also applied to the <i>kilesa's</i> and the <i>kāma's</i> (<i>cf.</i> Childers' Dicty. s.v. <i>upadhi</i>). The verses recur in IV, 1, §8, where an alternative rendering is given.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> The Master, writes B., seeing his false (or, rather, his one-sided) view, breaks into his speech with an opposite conclusion, as one may bring down a fruit by throwing another fruit at it.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> 'Among other wives' <i>(sesa-)</i> says B., whether in one household, or generally, is not clear.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> <i>Ājānīyo</i> is literally 'the knowing,' 'intelligent one.' 'Who knows the reason why,' says B., whether he be horse, elephant, or steer. Such was King Kūṭakaṇṇa's horse, who, when drawing the royal chariot to the Hill of Shrines, would not cross the Kalamba river (see Geiger's <i>Mahāvaṅsa</i> Translation, Map of Anurādhapura: Cetiyapabbata, Kalamba-nadī). The driver assured the annoyed monarch that the beast was not mutinous, but so well trained that he feared lest, by wetting his tail, he might spurt water over his master. 'Lift up his tail, Sire!' The King complied, and the horse entered the ford. (This king reigned over Ceylon A.D. 16-38.)</p>

In this Tortoise Sutta, referred to by B., the jackal and Māra, the tempter, are represented as getting no entrance, the former by the tortoise's action.

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a></sup> The verses on the next page are <i>verbatim</i> those in the Samiddhi Jātaka (vol. ii, No. 167). The story is the same, the diction a little different. The <i>devatā</i> of the Nikāya is shown in the Jātaka to be a deva-dhītā or 'goddess,' and the Burmese MSS. so allude to her: — <i>'anuppattā,' 'yakkhī.</i>' The Singhalese MSS. ignore the Jātaka, and write <i>anuppatto</i> and <i>yakkha</i>.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a></sup> A <i>Vihāra</i> built near the river Tapodā (hot waters), which ran beneath the Vebhāra of Vaibhāra Hill near Rājagaha (<i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> pp. 45, n. 1; 364). It broadened into a pool where was a hot spring due to its proximity to the Brazon Purgatory beneath. <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a></sup> The little riddle turns on the ambiguity of <i>bhutvā,</i> having eaten,' 'having enjoyed thyself in general,' — in other words 'sown your wild oats.' The significance of the 'hour,' or 'moment' recalls the <i>'Psalms'</i> (I, p. 12 <i>f.;</i> II, vers. 231, 403, 653, 1005), albeit neither commentator on this story brings out that point. The hour that is hidden is that of Samiddhi's death. <i>Cf.</i> below, IV, 3, § 1. Hence we have three points of time: — season of youth, opportunity for the Nibbāna-aspirant, death. <i>Cf.</i> the riddle of the flag, <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> LXIV.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a></sup> <i>Kālika,</i> lit. 'time-ish' (cf. the Greek <i>chrōñ-ios</i>). Of the negative form — <i>akālika,</i> often used in describing the Dhamma — B. says 'the Dhamma of the Ariyan Path gives its fruit (fruition-bliss) immediately after process' (or procedure to attain). In other words, the Path-graduate has his heavens at hand, not as postmortem events. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Pss of the Brethren,</i> 314, <i>n.</i>1.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a></sup> B. names alternative terms for noviciate, medium rank and theraship, vis.: to 5, 10 years, and after, or to 10, 20 years, and after.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a></sup> The verses occur <i>Iti-vuttaka,</i> § 63. The last two lines are quite different:—</p>

    <p class="f3 in4"><i>Touched hath his thought the goal of liberty,<br/> The station of incomparable peace.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt">The Buddha rebukes the fairy for her suggestive ambiguities.</p>

    <p class="lgqt">The burden of the verses is doctrinally and philosophically of high importance, and the bewilderment of the frivolous fairy, abruptly confronted with them, is ironically pathetic. 'Told by names,' lit., 'what may be expressed' (<i>akkheyyāni,</i> from <i>ā-khā</i>, to pro-claim); <i>cf.</i> <i>D.</i> i, 4; <i>Dhammapada,</i> 275; <i>A.</i> ii, 17, etc. Mankind, says B., have many notions (<i>saññino</i> — are 'ware of) about the many compounds of the five aggregates (<i>i.e.,</i> of mind and matter), expressed in names, <i>e.g.</i> god, man, layman, recluse, person, individual, Tissa, Phussa, etc. He who understands sees in these compounds as such no realities, nor a permanent entity in the declarer of them. The only realities are the several components (the five khandhas), and these, though real, are ever changing.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a></sup> <i>Yakkhī; cf.</i> below, Chapter X.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a></sup> These are the three forms of false opinion and strife springing from <i>māna.</i> See above I, 1, § 9; <i>S</i>. iii, 48; <i>Bud. Psy. Eth.,</i> p. 298 <i>f.</i> Expanded also to nine: <i>Vibhanga,</i> 389 <i>f.</i> Comparisons invalid in the ever-changing collocations that make up individuals.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a></sup> <i>Sankhā.</i> The arahant has put away such notions as 'lusting,' 'being angry,' 'confused.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> reads <i>na ca mānam ajjhagā,</i> and it is very likely, since this agrees with the context, that Feer read <i>vi-</i> erroneously if he consulted here only Singhalese MSS. Nevertheless B. allows the alternative sense, in <i>mānan</i> of an abode, <i>i.e.,</i> in rebirth, a matrix, <i>as if</i> he had a <i>v.l. = vimānaṅ</i> before him.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Sutta-Nipāta</i> 219.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a></sup> <i>Ibid.</i> 460, 1060, etc.; a frequent half-line in <i>S.N.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a></sup> The fairy has rightly discerned, says B., the Middle Path between self-indulgence and self-torture. In fact she gives the whole Eightfuld Path: — 'in speech, or body': Angas 305; 'mindful': Angas 6-8; 'understanding': Angas 1,2. 'It was in fact the occasion of a mighty teaching.'</p>
