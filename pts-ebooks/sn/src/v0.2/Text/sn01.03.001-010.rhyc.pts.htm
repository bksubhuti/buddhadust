    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">2. Now the King, the Kosalan Pasenadi, came into the presence of the Exalted One, and after exchanging greetings with him and compliments of friendship and courtesy,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said to the Exalted One: —</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does master Gotama also make no claim to be perfectly and supremely enlightened?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"If there be anyone, sire, to whom such enlightenment might rightly be attributed, it is I.</p>

    <p class="f4">I verily, sire, am perfectly and supremely enlightened."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, master Gotama, there are recluses and brahmins who also (like yourself) have each their order of disciples, their attendant followers, who are teachers of disciples, well-known and reputed theorizers,<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> highly esteemed by the people — I <span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span> mean Pūraṇa-Kassapa, Makkhali of the Cow-stall, the Nigaṇṭha Nāta's son, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son, Kaccāyana of the Pakudhas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> Ajita of the Hairblanket.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now they, when I have asked this same question of them,<br/> have not laid claim to perfect and supreme enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">How can this be?</p>

    <p class="f4">For (as compared with them) master Gotama is young in years, and is a novice in the life of religion."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"There are four young creatures, sire, who are not to be disregarded or despised, because they are youthful.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">A noble prince,<br/> a snake,<br/> a fire,<br/> an almsman (bhikhhu).</p>

    <p class="f4">Yea, sire, these four young creatures are not to be disregarded or despised because they are youthful."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Blessed One so saying, the Master spake again on this wise: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"A princely youth, by birth with fortune blest,<br/> Offspring of well-born families, let none<br/> Disdain for being youthful nor despise.<br/> The time may come when he, as lord of men,<br/> Comes to his heritage, and in his wrath<br/> May with a despot's weapons seek revenge<br/> With heavy hand. Hence from such attitude<br/> Let everyone who guards his life refrain.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Or if a man do walk within the woods<br/> And see a snake glide by, let him not say<br/> Disdainful: 'Tis a young one' and despise.<br/> In divers shapes and with an ardent force<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span> Fareth the snake. Should he attacking strike,<br/> He bites the heedless, be it man or maid,<br/> No matter when. Hence from such attitude<br/> Let everyone who guards his life refrain.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">A fire ablaze with appetite immense<br/> And swarthy trail let none despise as young<br/> Since it was lit, nor hold of no account.<br/> If it but win to fuel, growing great,<br/> It may attack the heedless, man or maid,<br/> And burn no matter when. From this therefore<br/> Let everyone who guards his life refrain.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The forest burnt by fire, the swarthy-trailed,<br/> After the lapse of many nights and days,<br/> In shoots and seedlings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> springs once more to life.<br/> But he whom almsman, strong in righteousness,<br/> Burneth with ardent flame,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> may look in vain<br/> For child, or offspring 'mong his stock. No wealth<br/> His heirs may find; childless and without heirs,<br/> Like to a palm-tree stump such men become.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Hence with these four—the serpent and the fire,<br/> The prince of high estate, the saintly friar —<br/> Let the wise man, his own good-will in sight,<br/> Conduct himself as seemly is and right."</p>

    <p class="f4">When these things had been said, King Pasenadi, the Kosalan, spoke thus to the Exalted One: —</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if a man were <span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span> to set up that which has been thrown down, or were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a lamp into the darkness so that those who have eyes could see external forms — just even so, lord, has the truth been made known to me, in many a figure by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, even I, lord, betake myself to the Exalted One as my refuge, to the Norm and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me as a follower, as one who from this day forth as long as life endures has taken his refuge therein.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Titthakarā.</i> One of the secondary meanings of <i>tittha</i> (landing place, ford) is 'unsound view,' or the teacher of it. See <i>JPTS</i>, 1913-14, p. 117, n. 5. B. paraphrases by <i>laddhikarā</i>: opinion-, or hypothesis-makers. On these six teachers see <i>Dialogues</i> i, 66 f.; and above, II, 3, § 10. The soubriquets of the second and sixth were, says B., from birthplace and habitual garment respectively. The third was leader of the (later so-called) Jains. B. gives the traditional account of the King's interview with them alluded to. It seems to show that the idea of a Buddha's advent was 'in the air' at that time.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i>: <i>Pakudhassa gottassa.</i> Feer elects to call him Kakudha; but in his index he gives Kakuddha, or Pakuddha.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> This point is historically interesting, as illustrating the long loyal friendship of Pasenadi. In <i>M.</i> ii, 124, we see him venerating the Buddha as one eighty years of age, like himself. On this king, whose personal name was probably Agnidatta, see <i>Bud. India,</i> 8-11. His sister, Princess Sumanā, was present, and there resolved to leave the world (as if the Sisters' Order was already started). See <i>Pss. of the Sisters,</i> p. 19 — a result scarcely to have been expected from the discourse.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> The Comy. takes <i>urago</i> as a generic term for several species of reptiles. It is not easy to render justly the notion of <i>tejasi, tejasā:</i> lit. with heat, or flame. <i>Cf.</i> the varied renderings of the term symbolically used in the Upanishads: (<i>e.g.</i> in <i>Chāndogya</i> III, 1, 3), Max Müller: 'glory of countenance'; Deussen: 'Kraft'; Böthlingk: 'Glanz.' <i>Cf. ib.</i> vii, 11, 1, 2; B.rhad. vi, 4, 6.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> As all the Suttas in this Chapter are associated with conversations at the Jeta Grove (Vihara), it is needless to repeat the preliminaries.

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> This sentence is one of the formulas of Arahantship that run all through the four Nikayas. B. has a comment on each of the beads in this 'rosary.'<br/> The 'burden' of the five aggregates (mind and body), of the kilesas or ten leading passions, of purposive worldly activities, of the pleasures of sense: — all these may be viewed as burdens by the Arahant. <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a></sup> I assign no metaphysical import to this dramatization of consciousness into a dual subject. <i>Cf.</i> my <i>Buddhist Psychology</i> (1914) p. 28 f. <i>Cf.</i> below 1, § 8: 'self' and 'soul' are the same word: <i>attā.</i> It should be noticed that in the verses the emphasis is shifted from the 'self,' animistically understood, to a man's acts — his present self — and results of acts which make up his future self.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a></sup> <i>Bhadramukha,</i> referred to in the <i>Comy.</i> as <i>senāpati.</i> This is probably a reference to Bandhula the general taking over the duties of a judge and repealing miscarriages of justice. See <i>Jātaka</i> iv, 150, The Rev. S. Sumangala tells me that <i>bhudra-mukha</i> (handsome-faced) is a polite colloquialism like our 'my learned, or honourable, or distinguished friend.' Or the remark may be meant more generally: —<br/> 'I am sick of it. Let any fine fellow show what he can do as judge! If they go such lengths to my face who am their feudal lord, what will they not do among themselves! What have I to do with such bribe-eating liars!' <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a></sup> Reading, of course, <i>khipaṁ</i> for <i>khippaṁ. Cf.</i> Aṅguttara, i, 287 (III, 'Yodhājīva-vagga,' 5).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> gives in brief the story of Queen Mallikā's humble antecedents, piety and swift promotion as told in the Kummasāpinda Jātaka (No. 415). But the Sutta itself is repeated only in the <i>Udāna</i> (V. 1). The <i>Comy.</i> pictures the King as seeking a confession of love for himself from the woman he had so benefited, and a confirmation of mutual trust; the Queen, on the other hand, as very wise and pious, going to the roots of the matter (<i>sa-rasen'eva kathetabbo</i>). No exegesis, however, is given on the import of the <i>attā</i> (soul or self) that is so supremely dear. For mothers, for all devoted lovers and friends, Mallikā would know that, as meaning one's own life or living self, what she said was untrue. If the Ātman, or immanent God be meant, it was true only of the pious non-Buddhist Indian. In rendering it 'soul,' I have had in mind rather that meaning of ideal self, 'honour,' 'character,' which seems latent both in the Christian text 'What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?' and in the inscription to the famous war-cartoon of <i>Punch</i> (1914): King Albert to Emperor William II. — 'Not my soul!' — than anything of definite animistic or Ātmanistic doctrine.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> here tells the story of the Pasenadi's dream as given in the Lohakumbhi Jātaka, where the mythical King Brahmadatta is made to dream a similar dream. See also <i>Dhammapada Comy.</i> on verse 60. In the <i>Saṁyutta</i> <i>Comy.</i> the fevered sleep of the dreamer is explained by his cherishing an illicit passion and plotting harm to the woman's husband. When the dream is explained by the Buddha, the King is described as hastily breaking off the preparations for the sacrifice. The ritual terms of the text are discussed at some length. Contrary to our modern theories, they are declared to have been in primitive times, peaceful rites, but to have been changed, in the days of Okkāka the Sākyan, into bloody sacrifices. On the 'Drink of Victory' see <i>Questions of King Milinda,</i> ii, 16, n. 3. The 'Peg-thrown Site' (<i>sammāpāsaṁ</i>) is explained as the binding or building of an altar where a <i>sammā</i> (wooden pin or peg) falls when thrown. The 'Bolts withdrawn' are said to have referred to a festivity of mutual trust and unlocked doors, but since those days to mean merely sacrificial paraphernalia.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a></sup> <i>Anukūlaṁ sadā</i>: 'perpetual meals, etc., established by persons in the past, given regularly.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a></sup> <i>Sāratta-rattā.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Theragāthā,</i> ver. 187.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a></sup> Tradition assigns this royal raid to the sudden disappearance of the King's turban-diadem. So our <i>Comy.</i> and the Mahāsāra Jātaka Introduction (No. 381). The verses, however, belong to the Bandhanāgāra Jātaka (No. 201), with which <i>Dhammapada Comy.</i> on ver. 345, 346 agrees.</p>
