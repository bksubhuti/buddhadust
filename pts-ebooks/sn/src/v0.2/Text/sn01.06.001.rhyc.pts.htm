    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Uruvelā<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>,<br/> on the banks of the river Nerañjarā,<br/> beneath the Goatherd's Banyan,<br/> and he had just attained full enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now as he was privately meditating,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> the thought arose in him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have penetrated<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> this Norm,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> deep, hard to perceive, hard to understand,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> peaceful<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> and sublime,<br/> no mere dialectic,<br/> subtle, intelligible only to the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">But this is a race devoting itself to the things to which it clings,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> devoted thereto,<br/> delighting therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">And for a race devoting itself to the things to which it clings,<br/> devoted thereto,<br/> delighting therein,<br/> this were a matter hard to perceive, to wit,<br/> that this <span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span> is conditioned by that —<br/> that all that happens is by way of cause.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, too, were a matter hard to discern, to wit,<br/> the tranquillization of all the activities of [worldly] life,<br/> the renunciation of all substrates of rebirth,<br/> the destruction of natural cravings,<br/> passionlessness,<br/> cessation,<br/> Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">And now I only might teach the Norm,<br/> and others might not acknowledge me:<br/> this would be wearisome to me,<br/> this would be hurtful to me."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And then verily to the Exalted One were revealed these verses on the spur of the moment,<br/> unheard of before: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"This that thro' many toils I've won,<br/> Enough! Why should I make it known?<br/> By folk with lust and hate consumed<br/> Not this a Norm that can be grasped.<br/> Against the stream [of common thought],<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/> Deep, subtle, fine, and hard to see,<br/> Unseen 't will be by passion's slaves,<br/> Cloaked in the murk [of ignorance]."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">In such wise,<br/> pondering over the matter,<br/> did the heart of the Exalted One incline to be averse from exertion<br/> and not towards preaching the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon to Brahmā-Sahampati,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/> becoming aware in thought of the thoughts of the Exalted One,<br/> was this revealed: —</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, woe! now will the world perish!</p>

    <p class="f4">Woe! now will the world utterly perish,<br/> in that the heart of the Tathāgata,<br/> Arahant,<br/> Buddha Supreme<br/> inclines to be averse from exertion<br/> and not towards preaching the Norm!"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[173]</b></span> Then did Brahmā-Sahampati,<br/> even like a strong man stretching his bent arm out,<br/> or drawing together his arm outstretched,<br/> vanish from the Brahmā world<br/> and appear before the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Brahmā Sahampati,<br/> draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/> and stooping his right knee to the ground,<br/> raised his joined hands towards the Exalted One and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord! let the Exalted One preach the Norm!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let the Blessed One preach the Norm!</p>

    <p class="f4">There are souls whose eyes are hardly dimmed by dust<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span>;<br/> they are perishing from not hearing the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">They will come to be knowers of the Norm."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake Brahmā Sahampati.</p>

    <p class="f4">And thereafter he said this also:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"There hath appeared in Magadha before thee<br/> A Norm impure by minds unclean contrived.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/> Unlock this door<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> t' Ambrosia! Let them hearken<br/> To Norm by Pure and Holy One revived.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">As on a crag on crest of mountain standing<br/> A man might watch the people far below,<br/> E'en so do thou, 0 Wisdom fair, ascending,<br/> 0 Seer of all, the terraced heights of truth,<br/> Look down, from grief released, upon the nations<br/> Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/> Arise, thou Hero! Conqueror in the battle!<br/> Thou freed from debt! Lord of the Caravan!<br/> Walk the world o'er, [sublime and blessed Teacher!]<br/> Teach us the Norm! There are, who'll understand."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/> understanding the entreaty of Brahmā,<br/> because of his pitifulness toward all souls,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/> looked down with a Buddha's Eye over the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One saw,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span> with a Buddha's Eye, so looking,<br/> souls whose eyes were scarcely dimmed by dust,<br/> and souls whose eyes were sorely dimmed by dust,<br/> souls sharp of sense<br/> and souls blunted of sense,<br/> souls of good<br/> and souls of evil disposition,<br/> souls docile<br/> and souls indocile,<br/> some among them living with a perception of the danger of other worlds and of wrongdoing.</p>

    <p class="f4">As in a pool of blue or red or white lotus,<br/> some lotus plants born in the water,<br/> emerge not, but grow up and thrive sunken beneath the surface;<br/> and other lotus plants,<br/> born in the water and growing up in the water,<br/> rise to the surface;<br/> and other lotus plants,<br/> born in the water and growing up in the water,<br/> stand thrusting themselves above the water and unwetted by it,<br/> even so did the Exalted One,<br/> look down over the world with a Buddha's Eye,<br/> and see souls whose eyes were scarcely dimmed by dust,<br/> souls whose eyes were sorely dimmed by dust,<br/> souls sharp of sense<br/> and blunted of sense,<br/> souls of good<br/> and souls of evil disposition,<br/> souls docile<br/> and souls indocile,<br/> some among them living with a perception of the danger of other worlds and of wrongdoing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seeing Brahmā Sahampati he made response in verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Open for them the doors stand to Ambrosia!<br/> Let those that hear renounce the faith they hold.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span><br/> Foreseeing hurt I have not preached, Brahmā,<br/> The Norm sublime and excellent for men."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now am I one by whom an opening has been given<br/> for the preaching of the Norm by the Exalted One!"</p>

    <p class="f4">And he bowed down before the Exalted One,<br/> and passing round him by the right,<br/> vanished there and then.</p>
