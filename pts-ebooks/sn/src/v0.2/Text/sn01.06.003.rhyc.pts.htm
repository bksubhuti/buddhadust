    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span> Now on that occasion Brahmādeva,<br/> son of a certain brahminee,<br/> left the world,<br/> going from home into the homeless<br/> in the Order of the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Brahmādeva,<br/> remaining alone and separate,<br/> earnest, ardent, and strenuous,<br/> attained ere long to that supreme goal of the higher life,<br/> for the sake of which the clansmen rightly go forth from home into the homeless;<br/> yea, that supreme goal did he by himself,<br/> even in this present life,<br/> come to understand and realize.</p>

    <p class="f4">He came to understand that birth was destroyed,<br/> that the holy life was being lived,<br/> that his task was done,<br/> that for life as we conceive it<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> there was no hereafter.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Brahmādeva thus became one of the Arahants.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Brahmādeva rose early one morning,<br/> and dressing himself,<br/> took robe and bowl and entered Sāvatthi for alms.</p>

    <p class="f4">And going about Sāvatthi,<br/> house by house,<br/> he came to his own mother's dwelling.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time his mother,<br/> the brahminee,<br/> was habitually making an oblation<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> to Brahmā.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurred to Brahmā Sahampati:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This mother of the venerable Brahmādeva,<br/> the brahminee,<br/> makes her perpetual oblation to Brahmā.</p>

    <p class="f4">What if I were now to approach and agitate her?"</p>

    <p class="f4">So as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm,<br/> or bend his arm stretched forth,<br/> Brahmā Sahampati vanished from the Brahmā world<br/> and appeared at the dwelling of the mother of the venerable Brahmādeva.</p>

    <p class="f4">And standing in the air he addressed her in verses: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Far hence, 0 brahminee, is Brahmā's world,<br/> To whom thou servest offerings alway.<br/> And Brahmā feedeth not on food like that.<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span> What babblest thou<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> unwitting of the way,<br/> 0 brahminee, unto the Brahmā world?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> Lo here! this Brahmādeva, son of thine,<br/> A man who ne'er will see another world,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> A man who past the gods hath won his way;<br/> An almsman who doth nothing call his own,<br/> Nor other soul beside himself maintains: —<br/> This man into thy house hath come for alms.<br/> Worthy of offerings, versed in the Lore,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> With faculties developed and controlled,<br/> Meet for oblations from both gods and men,<br/> True brahmin — 'barring all things evil out' —<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> By evil undefiled, grown calm and cool,<br/> He moveth on his quest for sustenance.<br/> There is no after, no before for him,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/> He is at peace, no fume of vice is his;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> He is untroubled, rid of hankering;<br/> All force renouncing toward both weak and strong.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/> Let him enjoy the choice meats thou hast served.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">By all the hosts of evil unassailed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/> His heart at utter peace, he goes about<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span> Like tamed elephant, with vices purged.<br/> Almsman most virtuous, and with heart well freed:<br/> Let him enjoy the choice meats thou hast served.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">On him so worthy of the gift do thou,<br/> In confidence unwavering, bestow thy gift.<br/> Work merit and thy future happiness,<br/> Now that thou seest here, 0 brahminee,<br/> A sage by whom the flood is overpassed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><i>On<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> him so worthy of the gift did she,<br/> In confidence unwavering bestow her gift.<br/> Merit she wrought, her future happiness,<br/> When [at her door] the brahminee beheld<br/> A sage by whom the flood was overpassed."</i></p>
