    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time there arose in the mind of Baka the Brahmā god,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> evil, erroneous notions, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This [Brahmā-life] is permanent and stable;<br/> this is eternal,<br/> this is absolute,<br/> this is influctuate in its nature;<br/> in this [life] there is no birth,<br/> nor decay,<br/> nor death;<br/> no falling from,<br/> nor rising up to;<br/> and beyond this there is no further salvation."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, discerning by thought<br/> the thoughts of Baka the Brahmā,<br/> like as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm,<br/> or bend his arm stretched forth,<br/> vanished from Jeta's Grove,<br/> and appeared in the Brahmā world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Baka the Brahmā saw the Exalted One coming afar off,<br/> and he called to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come, my lord! welcome, my lord!</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span> Long is it, my lord, since thou madest occasion to come this way.</p>

    <p class="f4">[See], my lord, this [Brahmā-life] is permanent and stable;<br/> this is eternal,<br/> this is absolute,<br/> this is influctuate in its nature;<br/> in this [life] there is no birth,<br/> nor decay,<br/> nor death;<br/> no falling from,<br/> nor rising up to;<br/> and beyond this there is no further salvation."</p>

    <p class="f4">To him, so saying, the Exalted One spake thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Alas, the good Brahmā Baka is very ignorant!</p>

    <p class="f4">Alas, the good Brahmā Baka is very ignorant!</p>

    <p class="f4">Inasmuch as he will be saying that something which is impermanent is permanent;<br/> that something which is unstable is stable;<br/> that something which is temporal is eternal;<br/> that something which is relative is absolute;<br/> that something from which one is bound to fall,<br/> admits not of decease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where there is birth,<br/> decay,<br/> death,<br/> decease and rebirth,<br/> of such a life will he be speaking as he does: —<br/> that no such things happen.</p>

    <p class="f4">And whereas there is another salvation beyond this,<br/> he will be saying that there is no other such!"</p>

    <p class="f4">[Baka:—]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"We seventy-two,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> Gotama, from our good works<br/> Rule o'er the world, birth and old age transcending.<br/> This is our last Veda-won life as Brahmās;<br/> Many the folk off'ring us prayers and praises."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One:—]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Brief is this life; verily length pertaineth<br/> Not to this life, deemed by thee, Baka, so lengthy,<br/> 'Gainst the life waiting for thee,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> 0 Brahmā,<br/> As I discern, lasting through countless ages."</p>

    <p class="f4">[Baka:—]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"If thou be th' Exalted One, birth and old age<br/> Transcending, then thine is the infinite vision.<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span> What help brought me rites and good works aforetime<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> Do thou declare this so that I may learn it."</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One:—]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"When many men, thirsty and heat-tormented,<br/> Thou in the past gavest to drink [and saved them]:<br/> Lo! this was thy 'rites and good works aforetime/<br/> As one from sleep newly awaked I remember.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">At Antelope Bank,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> when the village was raided,<br/> Thou didst release folk bound and led off captive;<br/> Lo! this was thy 'rites and good works aforetime/<br/> As one from sleep newly awaked I remember.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">When mystic force wielding thou didst deliver<br/> In Ganga's stream, vessel and crew assailed,<br/> By cruel snake fain to devour men victims:<br/> Lo! this was thy 'rites and good works aforetime'<br/> As one from sleep newly awaked I remember.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">And I, by name Kappa, was once thy pupil,<br/> Intelligent, wise did his teacher deem him:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span> Lo ! this was thy 'rites and good works aforetime.'<br/> As one from sleep newly awaked I remember."</p>

    <p class="f4">[Baka:—]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"0 this my life surely thou understandest!<br/> Yea, thou dost know others, since thou art wakened.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> Yea, hence prevails round us thy mighty glory,<br/> Radiance it sheds over the world of Brahmās."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> On this god see <i>M.</i> i, 328. The episode and verses form the 'Baka-Brahmā <i>Jātaka,' Jāt.</i> iii, 359 (trs. 219) [#405].</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> iii, 85.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Does this represent the number of the chief (Mahā) Brahmās?</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Abhijappanti:</i> 'lifting joined hands toward us, glorifying us, aspiring to be as we are.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Tava avasiṭṭhay ettakaṁ āyun ti ahaṁ jānāmi.</i> <i>Comy.</i> On the countless ages' see computations in <i>Jāt. Comy. loc. cit</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> I think this is more accurately rendered than the Jātaka translation, and agrees better with the emphatic refrain in the Buddha's reply: — This was ... 'If' and 'thine is' are inserted from the <i>Comy.</i> Metrical exigencies, perhaps, have rendered the Pali stanza a little obscure. 'You, being as you say, so far-seeing as to my life, tell me which of my past good deeds brought me here.' According to B., <i>vatasīlavattaṁ</i> is just <i>sīlaṁ</i>. <i>Vata</i> can scarcely mean the expletive <i>vata!</i> just here, as Feer seems to have thought. I prefer to let it stand as 'rites' that were really fruitful, to wit, brave deeds. The <i>S.</i> and <i>Jāt. Commentaries</i> elaborate the legends alluded to. In the first three cases, Baka in a former birth as the hermit Kesava exerts magic power, bringing a stream past the parched, strayed caravan, making dacoits see a vision of royal police approaching, and scaring away the snake as a Garuda-bird. The fourth instance is explained in the Kesava Jātaka (iii, 141 f.; trs. 93 f.) [No. 346].</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> As if it were a dream.' <i>Jāt.</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>Eṇi-kūlasmiṁ (Jāt. sic)</i>: — our <i>Comy.</i>: — <i>Gangā-tire'va. Jāt. Comy. — Eṇiyā nāma nadiyā kūle.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Again I suggest a better rendering than that of the Jātaka translation. The point of the allusion is, not that Kappa thought Kesava — a weak creature — wise, but that Kesava set such store on Kappa's intelligence and character, and so reported to the King. The <i>Jāt.</i> text reads <i>amaññaṁ,</i> 'I deemed.' The Br. has <i>amañña,</i> which is both 1st and 2nd person. If the verse is quoting Kesava's report, the 1st person is right.</p>
