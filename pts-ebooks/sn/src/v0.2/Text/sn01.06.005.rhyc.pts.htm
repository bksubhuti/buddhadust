    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time<br/> the evil and erroneous notion<br/> had occurred to a certain Brahmā:</p>

    <p class="f4">"No recluse or brahmin can come here."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/> learning by thought the thoughts of that Brahmā,<br/> like as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm,<br/> or draw in his arm stretched out,<br/> vanished from Jeta's Grove,<br/> and appeared in the Brahmā world.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One seated himself cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā,<br/> flames radiating from his body.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now it occurred to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Where is the Exalted One now abiding?"</p>

    <p class="f4">And with the heavenly eye,<br/> purified, passing the sight of men,<br/> he saw the Exalted One,<br/> seated above that Brahmā,<br/> flames radiating from his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, seeing him there,<br/> the venerable Moggallāna,<br/> like as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm,<br/> or draw in his arm stretched out,<br/> vanished from Jeta's Grove,<br/> and appeared in the Brahmā world,<br/> and seated him- <span class="f2 g"><b>[183]</b></span> self cross-legged in the air<br/> eastward of and lower than the Exalted One,<br/> flames radiating from his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">And it occurred to the venerable Kassapa the Great:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Where is the Exalted One now abiding?"</p>

    <p class="f4">And with the heavenly eye,<br/> purified, passing the sight of men,<br/> he saw the Exalted One,<br/> seated above that Brahmā,<br/> flames radiating from his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, seeing him there,<br/> the venerable Kassapa the Great,<br/> like as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm,<br/> or draw in his arm stretched out,<br/> vanished from Jeta's Grove,<br/> and appeared in the Brahmā world,<br/> and seated himself cross-legged in the air<br/> southward of and lower than the Exalted One,<br/> flames radiating from his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">And it occurred to the venerable Kappina the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Where is the Exalted One now abiding?"</p>

    <p class="f4">And with the heavenly eye,<br/> purified, passing the sight of men,<br/> he saw the Exalted One,<br/> seated above that Brahmā,<br/> flames radiating from his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, seeing him there,<br/> the venerable Kappina the Great,<br/> like as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm,<br/> or draw in his arm stretched out,<br/> vanished from Jeta's Grove,<br/> and appeared in the Brahmā world,<br/> and seated himself cross-legged in the air<br/> westward of and lower than the Exalted One,<br/> flames radiating from his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">And it occurred to the venerable Anuruddha,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Where is the Exalted One now abiding?"</p>

    <p class="f4">And with the heavenly eye,<br/> purified, passing the sight of men,<br/> he saw the Exalted One,<br/> seated above that Brahmā,<br/> flames radiating from his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, seeing him there,<br/> the venerable Anuruddha,<br/> like as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm,<br/> or draw in his arm stretched out,<br/> vanished from Jeta's Grove,<br/> and appeared in the Brahmā world,<br/> and seated himself cross-legged in the air<br/> northward of and lower than the Exalted One,<br/> flames radiating from his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna addressed that Brahmā in a verse:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Dost hold even to-day, my friend, the views<br/> Which heretofore are views that thou hast held?</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Dost thou behold, in this thy Brahmā-world,<br/> The dazzling sheen whereby't is all excelled?"</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Brahmā:—]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"My lord, no longer do I hold the views<br/> Which heretofore are views that I have held.<br/> I do behold, in this my Brahmā world,<br/> The dazzling sheen whereby't is all excelled.<br/> How were it possible for me to-day<br/> 'I am eternal! I am permanent!' to say?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/> having agitated that Brahmā,<br/> like a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br/> or draw in his arm stretched out,<br/> vanished from the Brahmin world and appeared in Jeta's Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Brahmā admonished one of his retinue, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come, dear sir, do thou approach the venerable Moggallāna the Great, and say unto him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Are there, my lord Moggal- <span class="f2 g"><b>[184]</b></span> lāna,<br/> yet other disciples of that Exalted One<br/> as gifted and as mighty as the lords<br/> Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina, and Anuruddha?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, dear sir." did that attendant Brahmā make response.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he fulfilled the behest.</p>

    <p class="f4">18. To him thus asking,<br/> the venerable Moggallāna the Great addressed this verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Disciples of the Buddha many they<br/> Who threefold lore have won and magic sway;<br/> Are skilled the thoughts of other minds to read,<br/> Are Arahants, in whom the Drugs are dead."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">19. Then that Brahmā,<br/> delighted and grateful that these words were spoken,<br/> repaired to the great Brahmā and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"My lord, thus did the venerable Moggallāna the Great reply:<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'Disciples of the Buddha many they<br/> Who threefold lore have won and magic sway;<br/> Are skilled the thoughts of other minds to read,<br/> Are Arahants, in whom the Drugs are dead.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">And the great Brahmā was delighted at that which the attendant Brahmā told him.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Tejodhātuṁ samāpajjitvā:</i> 'having attained to the sphere, or elemental condition, of heat.' By this technical phrase it is implied that, making the self-hypnotizing preamble (<i>parikamma</i>) of fixing sense and mind on fire, Jhāna was induced and, with it, 'the power at will to emit fire from the whole body' <i>Comy.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Pss. of the Sisters,</i> p. 112.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> These four great Brethren were by their leader declared foremost, respectively, in magic power, asceticism, preaching to the Order and the 'celestial eye.' <i>A.</i> i, 23.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> This context was overlooked in <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 392 f.; hence the verses are slightly inaccurate, the 'views' in question being held up to the moment when the splendid visitors proved them false.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Enumerating the six 'super-knowledges' (<i>abhiññā</i>). But it is curious that the sixth and last should be mentioned twice, and the 'celestial ear' (supernormal hearing) be left out. For B. confirms the fact (commenting on <i>A.</i> i, 163-5), that 'threefold lore' —a brahminic idiom annexed by Buddhism — meant super-memory, celestial eye, and destruction of <i>Āsavas</i> ('drugs'). Nevertheless he does not note the omission here. The detailed order followed in the <i>Saṁyutta-Nikdya</i> (see ii, 121; 212) is 'magic power (<i>iddhi</i>), the 'ear,' telepathy, super-memory, the 'eye,' drug-immunity — the same as that followed in <i>Dialogues,</i> i, 88 f.; <i>cf.</i> <i>D.</i> iii, 281.</p>
