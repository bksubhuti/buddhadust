    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2"><b>HUS</b></span> H<span class="f2"><b>AVE</b></span> I H<span class="f2"><b>EARD:</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">On this occasion the Kokālikan bhikkhu<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> coming into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him and took his seat at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">And so seated said thus <span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span> to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wicked, lord, in their desires<br/> are Sāriputta and Moggallāna!</p>

    <p class="f4">They are ruled by wicked desires!"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to the Kokālikan bhikkhu:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Say not so,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Kokālikan,<br/> say not so!</p>

    <p class="f4">Put thy heart's trust<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> in Sāriputta and Moggallāna!.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lovely<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> are Sāriputta and Moggallāna!"</p>

    <p class="f4">But the Kokālikan bhikkhu spoke a second time thus to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even though, lord, the Exalted One be trustworthy<br/> and his word reliable,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> yet wicked, I say, in their desires<br/> are Sāriputta and Moggallāna!,<br/> and ruled by wicked desires!"</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spoke a second time thus<br/> to the Kokālikan bhikkhu:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Say not so, Kokālikan,<br/> say not so!</p>

    <p class="f4">Put thy heart's trust<br/> in Sāriputta and Moggallāna!</p>

    <p class="f4">Lovely are Sāriputta and Moggallāna!"</p>

    <p class="f4">But the Kokālikan bhikkhu spoke the same words yet once again,<br/> and the Exalted One answered him in the same words.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Kokālikan bhikkhu,<br/> rising from his seat,<br/> saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/> and departed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And soon after,<br/> the Kokālikan's entire frame<br/> was covered with pustules<br/> like mustard seed.</p>

    <p class="f4">From the size of mustard seed<br/> they increased to that of small beans,<br/> to that of chick-peas,<br/> to that of kolaṭṭhi's,<br/> to that of jujube-fruit,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span> to that of myrobalan,<br/> to that of unripe vilva fruit,<br/> to that of billa fruit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whereupon they broke<br/> and discharged pus and blood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Kokalikan bhikkhu died of that disease,<br/> and being dead<br/> he was reborn in the White Lotus Purgatory<br/> for that he had hardened his heart<br/> against Sāriputta and Moggallāna!</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Brahmā Sahampati,<br/> when the night was far spent,<br/> shedding radiance with his effulgent beauty<br/> over the entire Jeta Grove,<br/> drew near to the Exalted One,<br/> and saluting, stood at one side and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Kokālikan bhikkhu, lord, is dead,<br/> and being dead<br/> he is reborn in the White Lotus Purgatory,<br/> for that he did harden his heart<br/> against Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

    <p class="f4">And having so said,<br/> Brahmā saluted,<br/> and passing round to left,<br/> vanished there and then.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/> when the night had passed,<br/> addressed the brethren,<br/> telling them of the visit of Brahmā Sahampati<br/> and of what he had announced.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken,<br/> a certain brother asked the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"How long, lord, is the measure of life<br/> in the White Lotus Purgatory?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Long indeed, bhikkhu, is the measure of life<br/> in the White Lotus Purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not easy is it to reckon<br/> how many years,<br/> or centuries,<br/> or tens or thousands of centuries."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Can we reckon it by means of a figure, lord?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"We can, bhikkhu," said the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose there were a load of twenty kharis<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> as we reckon them here in Kosala,<br/> of sesamum seed.</p>

    <p class="f4">And suppose at the end of every century<br/> a man were to take out one seed at a time.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sooner, bhikkhu, would that same load<br/> be used up and finished<br/> than [a term in] the Abbuda Purgatory.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now one term in the Nirabbuda Purgatory<br/> is equal to twenty in Abbuda Purgatory;</p>

    <p class="f4">one term <span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span> in Ababa Purgatory<br/> is equal to twenty in Nirabbuda Purgatory;</p>

    <p class="f4">one term in Aṭaṭa Purgatory<br/> is equal to twenty in Ababa Purgatory;</p>

    <p class="f4">one term in Ahaha Purgatory<br/> is equal to twenty in Aṭaṭa Purgatory;</p>

    <p class="f4">one term in Water-lily Purgatory<br/> is equal to twenty in Ahaha Purgatory;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">one term in the Sogandhika Purgatory<br/> is equal to twenty in the Water-lily Purgatory;</p>

    <p class="f4">one term in the Blue Lotus Purgatory<br/> is equal to twenty in the Sogandhika Purgatory;</p>

    <p class="f4">one term in the White Lotus Purgatory<br/> is equal to twenty in the Blue Lotus Purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">And one term in Red Lotus Purgatory<br/> is equal to twenty in White Lotus Purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">But it is in White Lotus Purgatory, bhikkhu,<br/> that the Kokālikan bhikkhu has been reborn,<br/> for that he hardened his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And thereupon the Blessed Master spake thus: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"In sooth to every man that's born<br/> A hatchet grows within his mouth,<br/> Wherewith the fool, whene'er he speaks<br/> And speaks amiss, doth cut himself.<br/> He who the blameworthy doth praise.<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/> Or who the praiseworthy doth blame,<br/> Builds by his mouth his evil doom,<br/> And by that doom he finds no weal.<br/> Trifling the evil luck of one<br/> Who by the dice doth lose his wealth.<br/> But greater far his evil luck,<br/> Taking his all and eke himself,<br/> Who 'gainst the Blessed Saints on earth<br/> Doth set his heart at enmity.<br/> For vaster epochs doth he go —<br/> A hundred thousand years and eke <br/> Thirty and six, and yet five more —<br/> To life in purgatory, who,<br/> In thought and word on wrong intent,<br/> Utters abuse of Ariyans."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This popular story is also told in <i>Sn.</i>: — Kokāliya sutta, Mahāvagga, 10, in <i>A.</i> v, 170, and in <i>Jāt</i>. iv, No. 481, as the Takkariya Jātaka. B. states that the Kokālikan bhikkhu was a native of a kingdom and city called Kokālī, and the son of a setthi (leading citizen) also so-called! Also that he was <i>not</i> the pupil of Devadatta (see <i>Vin. Texts,</i> iii, 251), but was known as Culla-Kokālika, to distinguish him from Maha-Kokāllka, the former, who was of the brahmin class. He then gives a concise account of the Kokālikan's grievance, more fully told in the <i>Jātaka</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>I.e. mā āhā, evaṁ. Comy.: mā evaṁ abhani.</i> Fausböll (<i>SBE</i>. X, p. 118) evidently read: <i>mā hi evaṁ.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> 'Charity,' in the <i>Jātaka</i> translation is scarcely correct. The verb <i>pa-sad</i> is constantly used to express 'faith, trust, confidence in.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Pesalā,</i> not 'amiable' (Fausböll, <i>op. cit.</i>), but 'sweetly virtuous' (<i>piya-sīlā</i>). <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> So our text and <i>Comy.</i> The <i>Jātaka</i> <i>Comy.</i> has: 'Thou, Lord, believest in thy chief disciples.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> 'Why? Through the mighty power of Karma. When once Karma gets "room," no one can thrust it off. It gave him no longer there to remain.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> According to the <i>Comy.</i>, the Kosalan measure, from a <i>pattha</i> upwards, were four times the bulk of those used in Magadha. 'Twenty <i>khāri's = 1 kharika,</i> or cartload of tila-seeds of the small Magadhese variety.' <i>Cf.</i> Rhys Davids: <i>Ancient Coins, etc.,</i> § 32.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> These names do not represent separate hells (<i>paṭiyekko nirayo natthi</i>), but only periods of time in Avīchi (the general term for the informal regions; <i>cf. Bud. Psy. Eth.,</i> p. 334) apportioned to each entrant by the automatic working of Karma. <i>Comy.</i></p>
