    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha,<br/> in the Bamboo Grove,<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Asurinda Bhāradvaja<br/> heard that the Bhāradvaja had<br/> 'left the world to enter the Order of Gotama the Recluse.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Vexed and displeased,<br/> he sought the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> and there reviled and abused the Exalted One<br/> with rude and harsh words.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus spoken,<br/> the Exalted One remained silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the Asurinda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thou art conquered, recluse,<br/> thou art conquered!"</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"The fool forsooth doth deem the victory his<br/> In that he plays the bully with rude speech.<br/> To him who knoweth how he may forbear,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> This in itself doth make him conqueror.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Worse of the two is he who, when reviled,<br/> Reviles again. Who doth not, when reviled,<br/> Revile again, a two-fold victory wins.<br/> Both of the other and himself he seeks<br/> The good; for he the other's angry mood<br/> Doth understand and groweth calm and still.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">He who of both is a physician, since<br/> Himself he healeth and the other too,—<br/> Folk deem him fool, they knowing not the Norm."</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had so said,<br/> Asurinda of the Bhāradvājas spake thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord,<br/> most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/> that which had been thrown down,<br/> or were to reveal<br/> that which was hidden away,<br/> or were to point out the right road<br/> to him who had gone astray,<br/> or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br/> so that those who had eyes<br/> could see external objects<br/> — even so, lord, has the lord Gotama<br/> shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">I even I, lord,<br/> betake myself to the Exalted One<br/> as my refuge,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">I would leave the world<br/> under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br/> I would take orders."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin left the world<br/> under the Exalted One,<br/> and was ordained.</p>

    <p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br/> the venerable Bhāradvāja, remaining alone and separate,<br/> earnest,<br/> ardent and strenuous,<br/> attained to that supreme goal<br/> of the higher life,<br/> for the sake of which<br/> the clansmen rightly go forth from home<br/> into the homeless;<br/> yea, that supreme goal did he<br/> by himself,<br/> even in this present life,<br/> come to understand and realize.</p>

    <p class="f4">He came to understand<br/> that rebirth was destroyed,<br/> that the holy life was being lived,<br/> that his task was done,<br/> that for life as we conceive it<br/> there was no hereafter.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja<br/> became one of the Arahants.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> 'Lord of Asura(demon)s.' This was the youngest of the brothers Bhāradvaja. <i>Comy.</i> In the Sutta he is called by the adjectival form: <i>Asurindaka,</i> 'demon-chiefer.' The name is so 'pagan' for a brahmin, and the Buddha's reply so suggestive of Sakka's (XI, 1, § 4), that a bifurcated or transferred legend here seems fairly plausible. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Dialogues,</i> ii, 73, also 297.</p>
