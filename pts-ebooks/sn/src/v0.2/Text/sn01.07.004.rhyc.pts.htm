    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha,<br/> in the Bamboo Grove,<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Bhāradvaja brahmin<br/> [known as] the Congey-man<br/> heard that the Bhāradvaja had<br/> "left the world to enter the Order of Gotama the Recluse."</p>

    <p class="f4">Vexed and displeased,<br/> he sought the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> and when there<br/> sat at one side in silence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, discerning by his mind<br/> the thoughts of that man's mind,<br/> addressed him in verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Whoso doth wrong the man that's innocent: —<br/> Him that is pure and from all errors free —<br/> His wicked act returns upon that fool<br/> Like fine dust that is thrown against the wind."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, the Congey-man said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/> that which had been thrown down,<br/> or were to reveal<br/> that which was hidden away,<br/> or were to point out the right road<br/> to him who had gone astray,<br/> or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br/> so that those who had eyes could see external objects<br/> — even so, lord, has the lord Gotama<br/> shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">I even I, lord, betake myself<br/> to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">I would leave the world under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br/> I would take orders."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin left the world under the Exalted One,<br/> and was ordained.</p>

    <p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br/> the venerable Bhāradvāja,<br/> remaining alone and separate,<br/> earnest,<br/> ardent and strenuous,<br/> attained [ere long] to that supreme goal of the higher life,<br/> for the sake of which the clansmen<br/> rightly go forth from home into the homeless;<br/> yea, that supreme goal did he by himself,<br/> even in this present life,<br/> come to understand and realize.</p>

    <p class="f4">He came to understand<br/> that rebirth was destroyed,<br/> that the holy life was being lived,<br/> that his task was done,<br/> that for life as we conceive it<br/> there was no hereafter.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the Arahants.</p>
