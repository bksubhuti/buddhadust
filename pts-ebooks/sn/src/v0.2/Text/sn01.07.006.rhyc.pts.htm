    <p class="f4">When The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> the Bhāradvāja [known as] Tangles,<br/> went to visit the Exalted One and,<br/> exchanging with him the compliments of amity and courtesy,<br/> took his seat at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he addressed the Exalted One in a verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Tangle within, without, lo! in the toils<br/> Entangled is the race of sentient things.<br/> Hence would I ask thee, Gotama, of this:<br/> Who is't can from this tangle disembroil?"</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"The man discreet, on virtue planted firm,<br/> In intellect and intuition trained;<br/> The brother ardent and discriminant:<br/> 'Tis he may from this tangle disembroil.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">They that have lust and hate and nescience spurned,<br/> The Arahants immune from deadly Drugs,<br/> For them the tangle all unravelled lies.<br/> Where mind and body wholly cease to be,<br/> And earthly sense and sense celestial: —<br/> Here is the tangle riven utterly."</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Tangles, said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/> that which had been thrown down,<br/> or were to reveal<br/> that which was hidden away,<br/> or were to point out the right road<br/> to him who had gone astray,<br/> or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br/> so that those who had eyes could see external objects<br/> — even so, lord, has the lord Gotama shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">I even I, lord, betake myself<br/> to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">I would leave the world under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br/> I would take orders."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin left the world under the Exalted One, and was ordained.</p>

    <p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br/> the venerable Bhāradvāja, remaining alone and separate,<br/> earnest,<br/> ardent and strenuous,<br/> attained [ere long] to that supreme goal of the higher life,<br/> for the sake of which the clansmen<br/> rightly go forth from home into the homeless;<br/> yea, that supreme goal did he by himself,<br/> even in this present life,<br/> come to understand and realize.</p>

    <p class="f4">He came to understand that<br/> rebirth was destroyed,<br/> that the holy life was being lived,<br/> that his task was done,<br/> that for life as we conceive it<br/> there was no hereafter.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the Arahants.</p>
