    <p class="f4">When The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> the Bhāradvāja [known as] 'Puritan'<br/> came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and exchanging with him<br/> the greetings and compliments of amity and courtesy,<br/> took his seat at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he addressed the Exalted One in a verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Though he be virtuous and penance work<br/> There is in all the world no brahmin found,<br/> Thus rendered pure.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'T is by the Veda-lore and by the course<br/> His class lays down<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> that he is purified,<br/> Unique 'mong men."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span> [The Exalted One: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Nay, though he jabber multitudes of runes,<br/> Thus is no brahmin made regenerate,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> Garbage-defiled within, propped by deceits.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">But be he noble, brahmin, commoner,<br/> Or labouring man, or of a pariah class,<br/> Who stirs up effort, puts forth all his strength,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> Advances with an ever vigorous stride,<br/> He may attain the Purity Supreme.<br/> Brahmin, know this!"</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Puritan said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/> that which had been thrown down,<br/> or were to reveal<br/> that which was hidden away,<br/> or were to point out the right road<br/> to him who had gone astray,<br/> or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br/> so that those who had eyes could see external objects<br/> — even so, lord, has the lord Gotama<br/> shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">I even I, lord, betake myself<br/> to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">I would leave the world<br/> under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br/> I would take orders."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin left the world under the Exalted One,<br/> and was ordained.</p>

    <p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br/> the venerable Bhāradvāja,<br/> remaining alone and separate,<br/> earnest,<br/> ardent and strenuous,<br/> attained [ere long] to that supreme goal of the higher life,<br/> for the sake of which the clansmen rightly go forth from home into the homeless;<br/> yea, that supreme goal did he by himself,<br/> even in this present life,<br/> come to understand and realize.</p>

    <p class="f4">He came to understand that<br/> rebirth was destroyed,<br/> that the holy life was being lived,<br/> that his task was done,<br/> that for life as we conceive it<br/> there was no hereafter.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the Arahants.</p>
