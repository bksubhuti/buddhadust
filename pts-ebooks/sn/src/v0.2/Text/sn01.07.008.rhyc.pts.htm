    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha,<br/> in the Bamboo Grove,<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/> a preparation of rice with ghee had been concocted<br/> for the Bhāradvaja brahmin [known as] the Fire-man,<br/> for he thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will offer the fire-sacrifice,<br/> I will tend the fire-oblation."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One<br/> having dressed early,<br/> and taken bowl and robe,<br/> went and entered Rājagaha for alms.</p>

    <p class="f4">And, going for alms from place to place,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> he drew near to the dwelling of the Fire-man Bhāradvaja,<br/> and approaching<br/> stood at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the brahmin beheld him coming for alms,<br/> and seeing him,<br/> addressed the Exalted One in a verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Proficient in the Vedas Three, a man<br/> Pure born and learned,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> and acquainted well<br/> With all the lore and ritual [of our class]: —<br/> His let it be to enjoy this goodly rice!"</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Nay,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> though he jabber multitudes of runes,<br/> Thus is no brahmin made regenerate,<br/> Garbage-defiled within, cloaked by deceits.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Whose vision many former lives hath pierced,<br/> Who sees the heavens above, the depths below,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> His is 't to win the doing down of birth: —<br/> Master of supernormal lore,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> a Seer.<br/> In these Three Vedas if a brahmin be<br/> One whom we call 'learned in the Triple Lore,'<br/> Of him shouldst thou declare: — 'acquainted well<br/> With all the lore and ritual [of ourselves]—<br/> 'His let it be to enjoy this goodly rice.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">[The brahmin:—]</p>

    <p class="f4">"May it please the worshipful Master Gotama to eat!<br/> His worship is a brahmin."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Not<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> mine to enjoy [presents] for chanting verses.<br/> Not normal this, brahmin, for minds discerning.<br/> Buddhas reject wages for chanting verses.<br/> True to the Norm, this is their mode of conduct.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> On other grounds minister thou, 0 brahmin,<br/> With food and drink to a great Seer made perfect,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/> To one from whom purged are the mental Poisons,<br/> In whom is calm, peace from all fret and worry.<br/> Yea, here's the field, if for reward<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> thou lookest."</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Fireman, the Bharadvaja, said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/> that which had been thrown down,<br/> or were to reveal<br/> that which was hidden away,<br/> or were to point out the right road<br/> to him who had gone astray,<br/> or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br/> so that those who had eyes could see external objects<br/> — even so, lord, has the lord Gotama<br/> shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">I even I, lord, betake myself<br/> to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">I would leave the world under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br/> I would take orders."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin<br/> left the world under the Exalted One,<br/> and was ordained.</p>

    <p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br/> the venerable Bhāradvāja,<br/> remaining alone and separate,<br/> earnest,<br/> ardent and strenuous,<br/> attained [ere long] to that supreme goal of the higher life,<br/> for the sake of which the clansmen rightly go forth from home into the homeless;<br/> yea, that supreme goal did he by himself,<br/> even in this present life,<br/> come to understand and realize.</p>

    <p class="f4">He came to understand<br/> that rebirth was destroyed,<br/> that the holy life was being lived,<br/> that his task was done,<br/> that for life as we conceive it there was no hereafter.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the Arahants.</p>
