    <p class="f4">While at Sāvatthi, the Exalted One,<br/> dressing himself early,<br/> and taking bowl and robe,<br/> came one day to the dwelling of Udaya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the brahmin.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Udaya the brahmin<br/> filled the Exalted One's bowl with rice.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One repeated his visit<br/> the second day,<br/> and yet again the third,<br/> and each time Udaya the brahmin<br/> filled his bowl with rice.</p>

    <p class="f4">After he had done so the third time,<br/> Udaya the brahmin said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"A pertinacious man<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is the friar Gotama,<br/> that he comes again and again!"</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Again, again is seed in furrow sown,<br/> Again, again the cloud-king sends down rain,<br/> Again, again the ploughmen plough the fields,<br/> Again, again comes corn<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> into the realm,<br/> Again, again do beggars<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> go their round,<br/> Again, again do generous donors give,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span> Again, again when many gifts are given,<br/> Again, again the donors find their heaven.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> Again, again the dairy-folk draw milk,<br/> Again, again the calf its mother seeks,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> Again, again we tire and toil anew,<br/> Again, again the slow wits seek rebirth,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> Again, again comes birth and dying comes,<br/> Again, again men bear us to the grave.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">When once the man of broad insight that Path<br/> Which brings no new becoming doth attain,<br/> Then is he no more born again, again."</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Udaya the brahmin said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama,<br/> most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">As if one raised up<br/> that which had been overthrown,<br/> or revealed<br/> that which had been hidden,<br/> or declared the way<br/> to one who was bewildered,<br/> or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br/> so that they that had eyes could see,<br/> even so is the Norm in many ways<br/> made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge<br/> to Gotama the Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm,<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br/> who from this day forth<br/> as long as life endures<br/> has taken in him refuge!"</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Not met with elsewhere. The brahmin's name recurs, <i>Sn.</i> V. 1105 f.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Pakaṭṭhako</i> is exegetically explained as <i>rasagiddho,</i> 'greedy for tastes'; the word is very rare in Pali. See the Sskr. <i>ka.sṭa.</i> 'A desperate fellow for dinner is the friar!' <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Reading <i>dhañña.</i> See <i>op. cit.</i> below.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> 'Here he skilfully brings in himself.' <i>Comy.</i> Humorously, too, he hints at the self-sacrificing donor called <i>dānapati. Cf.</i> above, II, 3 §3</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> So far the verses form part of Sakuḷudāyin's poem, <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> vers. 531, 532. Is there any coincidence between this name and Udaya? <i>Cf.</i> above, VII, 1, § 3. B. speaks of the whole list as 16 things that have to be recurrently done in life. To get 16, we must take 2 each in lines 11, 13.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> Possibly meaning incurs rebirth. B. is silent.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>Theragathā,</i> 17, 101.</p>
