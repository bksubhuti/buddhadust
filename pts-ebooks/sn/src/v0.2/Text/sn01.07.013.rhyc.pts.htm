    <p class="f4">On one occasion, at Sāvatthi, the Exalted One fell ill with intestinal wind.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Upavāna was attending on the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One appealed to him, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Prithee, Upavāna,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> dost know how I can get hot water?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely, lord," responded the venerable Upavāna,<br/> and making ready he took bowl and robe,<br/> and sought the dwelling of the brahmin Devahita.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he got there he stood silently aside.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span> Now Devahita saw him standing thus in silence,<br/> and addressed him in the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"His Worship standing there and speaking not,<br/> With shaven head and face, wrapped in his cloak,<br/> What doth he wish for, what may be his quest,<br/> What would he beg, that he is thither come?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">[Upavāna: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"An Arahant, the Blessed of all men,<br/> A holy sage, he suffereth sore with wind.<br/> It there be any water heated here,<br/> 0 give it to me, brahmin, for the sage.<br/> Revered by them to whom we reverence owe,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> Cherished by them who claim our pious care,<br/> Honoured by them to whom honour is due,<br/> For him I do beseech it may be brought."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Devahita the brahmin made a serving man take hot water on a carrying-pole<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> and a jar of molasses,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> and offered them to the venerable Upavāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Upavana came to the Exalted One<br/> and administered them to him,<br/> fomenting with the hot water<br/> and mixing the molasses with hot water.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the illness of the Exalted One abated.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Devahita the brahmin came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and exchanging with him the greetings of courtesy and amity,<br/> took his seat at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he addressed the Exalted One in the verse:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Where should he give<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> who hath a gift to make?<br/> Where given, will his offering bear much fruit?<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[222]</b></span> Yea, how to him who doth oblation bring —<br/> How shall his tribute work effectively?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One:—]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Whose<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> vision many former lives hath pierced.<br/> Who sees the heavens above, the depths below,<br/> Whose is't to win the doing down of birth: —<br/> Master of supernormal lore, a seer: —<br/> There should he give who hath a gift to make,<br/> There given, will his offering bear much fruit,<br/> Yea, thus to him who doth oblation bring —<br/> Thus shall his tribute work effectively."</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus spoken,<br/> Devahita the brahmin said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">As if one raised up<br/> that which had been overthrown,<br/> or revealed<br/> that which had been hidden,<br/> or declared the way<br/> to one who was bewildered,<br/> or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br/> so that they that had eyes could see,<br/> even so is the Norm in many ways<br/> made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm,<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br/> who from this day forth<br/> as long as life endures<br/> has taken in him refuge!"</p>
