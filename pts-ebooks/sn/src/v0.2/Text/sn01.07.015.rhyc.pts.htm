    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2"><b>HUS</b></span> H<span class="f2"><b>AVE</b></span> I H<span class="f2"><b>EARD:</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">On one occasion, at Sāvatthi,<br/> there was a brahmin living there called Pridestiff.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He showed respect neither to his mother,<br/> nor to his father,<br/> nor to his teacher,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> nor to his eldest brother.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One,<br/> surrounded by a large congregation,<br/> was teaching the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">And it occurred to the brahmin, Pridestiff:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This Samana Gotama,<br/> surrounded by a large congregation,<br/> is teaching the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">What if I were to go near?</p>

    <p class="f4">If he will talk to me,<br/> I will talk to him;<br/> if not, I will not speak to him."</p>

    <p class="f4">And he drew near and stood at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One did not speak to him.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[225]</b></span> And Pridestiff thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This Samana Gotama does not know anything,"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> was fain to turn back again.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One discerning intuitively<br/> the thoughts of the brahmin,<br/> addressed him in the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Not well is it to foster pride!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> If there be any here,<br/> Brahmin, for sake of whom thou'rt come,<br/> Give him thy fostering care."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Pridestiff thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Samana Gotama knows my thoughts!"<br/> and there and then<br/> he fell on his face at the Exalted One's feet<br/> and kissed those feet<br/> and stroked them,<br/> telling his name:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pridestiff am I, Master Gotama,<br/> Pridestiff am I, Master Gotama!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the congregation was astonished, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"0 wonderful, sir!</p>

    <p class="f4">0 astonishing, sir, is it!</p>

    <p class="f4">For this Pridestiff shows respect<br/> to neither mother,<br/> nor father,<br/> nor teacher,<br/> nor eldest brother,<br/> and yet he utterly prostrates himself in this manner<br/> before the Samana Gotama."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said to Pridestiff:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough, brahmin,<br/> stand up and sit down in thine own place,<br/> whence belief in me arose in thy heart."</p>

    <p class="f4">So Pridestiff sat down in his own place<br/> and addressed the Exalted One in the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"To whom should one show due humility,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> Whom treat with reverence?<br/> Whom should one offer honour and respect!<br/> To worship whom is well?"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2226]</b></span> [The Exalted One: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"To mother and to father shouldst thou show<br/> Humility, to eldest brother too,<br/> And fourthly to thy teacher: these shouldst thou<br/> With reverence treat, these honour and respect,<br/> These worshipfully to entreat is well.<br/> The Arahants, the Saintly Cool,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> whose work<br/> Is perfected, and they sane and immune,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> These peerless ones, docile,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> thy pride subdued,<br/> In veneration hold."</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Pridestiff, the brahmin, said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">As if one raised up<br/> that which had been overthrown,<br/> or revealed<br/> that which had been hidden,<br/> or declared the way<br/> to one who was bewildered,<br/> or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br/> so that they that had eyes could see,<br/> even so is the Norm in many ways<br/> made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm,<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br/> who from this day forth<br/> as long as life endures<br/> has taken in him refuge!"</p>

Cf.</i> a similar character in Jenta (<i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> CCXVIII), the son of Pasenadi's chaplain, and with whom this Pridestiff should have been identified. <i>Dhammapāla</i> describes him as <i>mānthaddo,</i> and gives a similar narrative.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Unsaluted an <i>ācariya</i> (teacher) refused instruction, and, if the discourtesy proceeded from an ex-pupil, recognition. <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> 'In that he takes no notice of a high-bred person like me.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> The Burmese MS. of Dhammapāla's <i>Comy.</i> used in <i>op cit.</i> reads:</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><i>'Na mānabrūhanaṁ sādhu. Atthāṁ karīyatha, brāhmaṇa,'</i> which is simpler than the reading in Feer's edition, and avoids the doubled <i>brāhmaṇa</i>. But it is otherwise awkward, and is less courteous in tone.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> VII, 1, § 5, n, 2.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> The Pali idiom is '(not) make pride.' <i>Cf.</i> <i>Jāt.</i> iv, 388.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> references in Index under 'cool.' <i>Buddhism</i> (1912), p. 175; and below, VIII, § 4.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> references in Index under 'sane.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Lit. not-stiff, supple-minded. The Br. MS. is here perhaps the corrupter reading: <i>nihacca mānaṁ atthadvāre,</i> so we follow Feer, and let the pada refer to the brahmin.</p>
