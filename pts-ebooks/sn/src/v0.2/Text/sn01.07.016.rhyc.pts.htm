    <p class="f4">On one occasion, at Sāvatthi,<br/> a brahmin named The Gainsayer<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> was living at Sāvatthi.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What if I were to go to visit the Samana Gotama,<br/> and to whatever he says,<br/> I were to maintain the opposite?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One<br/> was walking to and fro in the open air.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Gainsayer drew nigh<br/> and followed the Exalted One<br/> as he walked to and fro,<br/> and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Recite some doctrine, friar!"</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One:—]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Nay, not with thee, Gainsayer, with thine heart<br/> Corrupt and full of animosity,<br/> Sound thinking or sound speaking [shall I find].</p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[227]</b></span> Whoso can strife and discord of the mind<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> Suppress, and give up enmity, 't is he<br/> In truth can apprehend what's soundly spoke."</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Gainsayer the brahmin said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">As if one raised up<br/> that which had been overthrown,<br/> or revealed<br/> that which had been hidden,<br/> or declared the way<br/> to one who was bewildered,<br/> or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br/> so that they that had eyes could see,<br/> even so is the Norm in many ways<br/> made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm,<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br/> who from this day forth<br/> as long as life endures<br/> has taken in him refuge!"</p>
