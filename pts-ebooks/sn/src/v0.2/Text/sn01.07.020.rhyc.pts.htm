    <p class="f4">On one occasion at Sāvatthi<br/> a mendicant<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> brahmin came to visit the Exalted One and,<br/> exchanging with him the greetings and compliments of courtesy,<br/> sat down at one side,<br/> and said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Both I, Master Gotama,<br/> am a mendicant<br/> and his reverence is a mendicant.</p>

    <p class="f4">What difference is there here between us?"</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"No<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> man is rightly 'mendicant' so far<br/> As he merely from others seeketh alms.<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[231]</b></span> And is he pledged unto a tainted norm,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> Neither to that extent 'almsman' is he.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Whoso, with us, hath in the higher life<br/> Cast out both wickedness and [all the work<br/> Of piling] merit,<span class="f3"><sup>4</sup></span> and by judgement sound<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> Fares through the world, 'almsman' indeed is he."</p>

    <p class="f4">When this was spoken<br/> the mendicant brahmin said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">As if one raised up<br/> that which had been overthrown,<br/> or revealed<br/> that which had been hidden,<br/> or declared the way<br/> to one who was bewildered,<br/> or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br/> so that they that had eyes could see,<br/> even so is the Norm in many ways made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm,<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br/> who from this day forth<br/> as long as life endures<br/> has taken in him refuge!"</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Bhikkhako.</i> See preceding Sutta.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Occurs <i>Dhp.</i> vers. 266, 267.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Taking <i>vissaṁ dhammaṁ</i> to mean 'the whole law,' Max Müller failed to grasp the point or the Pali. An 'almsman' is essentially one who holds 'right views' and shapes his life according to the sound judgements of the same. On <i>vissaṁ, cf Dhs.</i> § 625; <i>Asl.</i> 319: 'putrid,' 'rancid.' Both Commentaries on the verse refer to such smells; ours also to 'bad norm'; that on <i>Dhp.</i> to merely bodily acts (as the only rule of life).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Max Müller's 'good and bad,' <i>pace</i> Nietzsche, is misleading for a European. (Fausböll's too. See <i>Sn.</i> ver. 520.) Making merit and reaping its reward was mere layman's creed (<i>cf.</i> the preceding Sutta), not that of a genuine bhikkhu, who by entering on the Path had renounced heavenly goals.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Sankhā,</i> paraphrased in both Commentaries by <i>ñāṇa,</i> and explained in <i>Dhp. Comy.</i> as the exercise of discernment and philosophical judgement in regard to all things (<i>Dhp. Comy.</i> iii, 393).</p>
