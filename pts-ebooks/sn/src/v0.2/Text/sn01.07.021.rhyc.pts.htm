    <p class="f4">On one occasion when the Exalted One was at Sāvatthi<br/> the brahmin Sangārava<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> was living there,<br/> and he was a Purity-by-Water man<br/> believing<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in purification by water;<br/> evening and morning he made a religious practice<br/> of going down into the water.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span> Now the venerable Ānanda<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> rising early and dressing himself,<br/> took bowl and robe<br/> and went into Sāvatthì for alms.</p>

    <p class="f4">Making his tour he dined,<br/> and on his return went to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him,<br/> and took his seat at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, he told the Exalted One<br/> of the views of Sangārava the brahmin,<br/> and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It would be well, lord,<br/> if the Exalted One would visit the dwelling<br/> of Sangārava the brahmin,<br/> out of compassion for him."</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One silently consented.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the next morning early<br/> the Exalted One dressed himself,<br/> and taking bowl and robe,<br/> set out for the dwelling of Sangārava the brahmin<br/> and, when there,<br/> seated himself on a seat that stood ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Sangārava came up to the Exalted One,<br/> and exchanging with him the greetings<br/> and compliments of courtesy,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, to him the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is it indeed true, brahmin,<br/> that thou art a water-purifier,<br/> and believest in purification by water;<br/> and dost thou make it a religious practice<br/> to go down into the water both evening and morning?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"That is so, Master Gotama."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now what advantage, brahmin,<br/> art thou looking for,<br/> in that thou believest and actest on this wise?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"In this way, Master Gotama:</p>

    <p class="f4">The evil deeds that I do during the day,<br/> these by my bathing<br/> I cause to be borne away the same evening;<br/> the evil deeds that I do at night,<br/> these by my bathing<br/> I cause to be borne away the next morning.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the advantage I look for,<br/> in that I believe and act on this wise."</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"The Norm's a lake, virtue its strand for bathing,<br/> Clear, undefiled, praised by the good to good men,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[233]</b></span> Wherein in sooth masters of lore come bathing,<br/> So, clean of limb, to the Beyond cross over."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When this was spoken,<br/> Sangarava said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">As if one raised up<br/> that which had been overthrown,<br/> or revealed<br/> that which had been hidden,<br/> or declared the way<br/> to one who was bewildered,<br/> or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br/> so that they that had eyes could see,<br/> even so is the Norm in many ways made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm,<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br/> who from this day forth<br/> as long as life endures<br/> has taken in him refuge!"</p>
