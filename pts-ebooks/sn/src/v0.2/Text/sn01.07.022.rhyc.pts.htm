    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying among the Sākyans<br/> at a Sākyan township named Khomadussa.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now at an early hour<br/> the Exalted One dressed himself and,<br/> taking bowl and robe,<br/> entered the township of Khomadussa for alms.</p>

    <p class="f4">And just then the brahmin householders of the place<br/> were assembled in their place of council<br/> to transact some matters,<br/> and the god was raining drop by drop.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One came up to the hall,<br/> and they saw him coming from afar.</p>

    <p class="f4">And seeing him, they said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Who now are these shaveling friar-men?</p>

    <p class="f4">And what can they know about council rules?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brahmin house-fathers of Khomadussa in the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"No 'council' that where are no pious gentlemen,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> Nor gentle they whose speech observes no rule.<br/> They who have put far from them lust and enmity<br/> And dullness, they become good gentlemen.</p>

    <p class="f4">When this was spoken,<br/> the Khomadussa brahmin house-fathers said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

    <p class="f4">As if one raised up<br/> that which had been overthrown,<br/> or revealed<br/> that which had been hidden,<br/> or declared the way<br/> to one who was bewildered,<br/> or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br/> so that they that had eyes could see,<br/> even so is the Norm in many ways made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lo! We go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm,<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer us as a lay-adherents,<br/> who from this day forth<br/> as long as life endures<br/> has taken in him refuge!"</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Meaning 'linen cloth'; 'because of the preponderance (<i>usmnnattā</i>) of such,' says B.; but whether as made there, or worn, or both, does not appear. I can find no other reference to the place.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Lit. 'hall-rule' (<i>sabhā-dhamma</i>). According to B., there was a side-entrance to avoid disturbing those who were comfortably seated, but the Buddha, aware that he would be creating or suffering discomfort, walked 'straight' in (<i>ujukam eva āgacchati</i>), angering the audience. He had previously 'willed the rain to fall.' The reason is not given, unless it served as an excuse for taking shelter.</p>
