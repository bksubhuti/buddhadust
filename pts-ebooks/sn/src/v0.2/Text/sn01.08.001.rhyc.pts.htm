    <p class="f4">The venerable Vaṅgīsa<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> was once staying near Ālāvi<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> at the chief temple<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> of that place,<br/> together with his tutor,<br/> the venerable Nigrodha-Kappa.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span>.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/> the venerable Vaṅgīsa was a novice,<br/> not long ordained,<br/> who was left behind<br/> as custodian at the Vihāra.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of women,<br/> gaily adorned,<br/> came into the pleasance to see the Vihāra.</p>

    <p class="f4">And seeing those women,<br/> disaffection<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> in consequence<br/> arose in the venerable Vaṅgīsa,<br/> and lust harassed his heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">And then he thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Alas! the loss to me!</p>

    <p class="f4">Alas! no gain to me!</p>

    <p class="f4">Alas! how hard for me to gain!</p>

    <p class="f4">Alas! no easy thing for me to gain!<br/> in whom disaffection has arisen,<br/> and lust harasses the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">How were it possible here and now<br/> that another<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> should cause me<br/> to get <span class="f2 g"><b>[235]</b></span> rid of this disaffection<br/> and produce loyal love?</p>

    <p class="f4">What if I were now by myself<br/> to get rid of my disaffection<br/> and cause loyal love to arise?"</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Vaṅgīsa by himself<br/> got rid of his disaffection<br/> and caused loyal love to arise within him.</p>

    <p class="f4">In that hour he uttered these verses: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Alas!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> That now when I am gone from home<br/> Into the homeless life, these wanton thoughts<br/> Sprung from the Dark should flit about my mind!<br/> Were high-born warriors, mighty archers, trained<br/> In champion bow-craft, such as never flee,<br/> A thousand, shooting arrows round about —<br/> But women! ... well, far more than these may come,<br/> Yet shall they never wreck my peace of mind.<br/> Firmly established in the Norm<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> I stand.<br/> For even in his presence have I heard<br/> The Buddha of the sun's high lineage tell<br/> About the Path that to Nibbāna goes,<br/> And there the love of all my heart is given.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> Now that I always in such mood abide,<br/> Dost think, vile one, thou canst draw nigh to me;<br/> Then shall I act in such wise, Death, that thou<br/> Wilt ne'er discover which the way I take.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> On the curious legend concerning his profession and conversion, see <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 395 <i>f.</i> B. gives it at the last of these Suttas.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Is frequently mentioned in Pali literature. See <i>JPTS.,</i> 1888, p. 11; <i>cf. Dhp. Comy.</i> iii, 170; 261 <i>f.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Or shrine: <i>cetiya. Comy.</i> Probably erected by a pre-Buddhistic cult. See below, X, § 12.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> See <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 408 <i>f.;</i> <i>Sn.</i> ver. 342 <i>f.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> It being his first year and he unskilled in the bowl-and-robe usages, the Theras left him to guard sunshades, sandals, and staves, while they went for alms. <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>An-abhirati;</i> 'loyal love' = <i>abhirati,</i> a strong form of <i>rati. Cf.</i> Māra's daughter so-called. IV, 3, § 5: 'Discontent.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>I.e.</i> in the absence of his 'spiritual pastors and masters,' as the <i>Comy.</i> remarks.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> I give the rendering (with three alterations) as in the <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> 1209-13, and refer the reader to the notes there. B.'s comments agree with those of the <i>Dhammapāla</i> (pointing to (<i>a</i>) a common source of materials, (<i>b</i>) dependence — see § 2, <i>n.</i> 2), and he, too, fails to make clear the syntax of <i>sahassaṅ apalāyinaṅ,</i> unless it be a genitive absolute. 'Thousand,' however, belongs to the bowmen and not to their arrows, and has been corrected accordingly. 'The best archer,' say the Commentators, 'can only shoot one arrow at a time; women by appealing to the senses shoot five any moment!'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Not <i>dhammesu,</i> but <i>dhamme su,</i> or <i>so.</i> B. has <i>Sāsanadhamme,</i> 'rule, or Norm of the Teaching,' or 'Church,' as we should say.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> This is the 'loyal' love once more confessed and triumphant. <i>Cf.</i> the <i>rato, abhirato</i> of <i>Pss of the Brethren,</i> ver. 742, and <i>Sisters,</i> vers. 359, 450.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> Māra's baffled ignorance in IV, 3, § 3; <i>cf.</i> also above, IV, 2. § 9.</p>
