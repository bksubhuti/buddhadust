    <p class="f4">The venerable Vaṅgīsa was once staying near Ālāvi<br/> at the chief temple of that place,<br/> together with his tutor,<br/> the venerable Nigrodha-kappa.</p>

    <p class="f4">On this occasion the venerable Vaṅgīsa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> was despising amiable brethren<br/> because of his skill in improvisation.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Alas! no gain to me!</p>

    <p class="f4">Alas! how hard for me to gain!</p>

    <p class="f4">In that I have been despising amiable brethren<br/> because of my skill in improvisation."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then blaming himself for such conduct,<br/> he of himself repented<br/> and in that hour uttered the verses<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup>: —</span></p>
