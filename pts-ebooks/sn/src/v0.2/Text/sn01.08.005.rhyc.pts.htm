    <p class="f4">On one occasion, when he was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at the Jeta Vana,<br/> the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yea, lord," they said responsive.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he spake:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Possessed of four qualities, Bhikkhus,<br/> is the speech that is well<br/> and not ill spoken,<br/> faultless<br/> and not blameable by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[240]</b></span> Of what four qualities?</p>

    <p class="f4">Here, Bhikkhus, if a brother speak well<br/> and not badly,<br/> speak righteously<br/> and not unrighteously,<br/> speak affectionately<br/> and not unkindly,<br/> speak truth<br/> and not falsehood,<br/> his speech having these four qualities,<br/> is well spoken,<br/> faultless,<br/> and not blameable by the wise."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br/> and the Blessed One saying this,<br/> the Master spake thus further: —</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṅgīsa,<br/> rising from his seat,<br/> and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/> stretched forth his hands<br/> saluting, to the Exalted One, and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is revealed to me, Exalted One,<br/> it is revealed to me, Blessed One!"</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Be it revealed to thee, Vaṅgīsa!"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṅgīsa extolled the Exalted One in his presence<br/> in suitable verses: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Whoso can speak a word whereby he works<br/> No torment to himself, nor causeth harm<br/> To fellow-men, that word is spoken well.<br/> Whoso can speak a kindly word, a word<br/> That's grateful to the ear, and lays not hold<br/> Of other's faults, that word is kindly spoke.<br/> Truth is ambrosial speech<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>; of saints of old<br/> This was the ancient Norm<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>; on Truth and good<br/> And Norm, 't is said, the saints do firmly stand.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The Word which the Awakened speaketh, sure<br/> Safe guide to make Nibbāna ours, to put<br/> An end to Ill: — that is the Word Supreme."</p>
