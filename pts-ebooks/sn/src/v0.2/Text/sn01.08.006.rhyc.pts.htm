    <p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at the Jeta Vana,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta was instructing,<br/> enlightening,<br/> inciting,<br/> and inspiring the brethren by a sermon,<br/> delivered in courteous speech,<br/> without impediment,<br/> clearly enunciated,<br/> communicating the matter in hand.</p>

    <p class="f4">And those brethren with their whole mind applied,<br/> attentive and intent,<br/> listened with rapt hearing to the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṅgīsa thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The venerable Sāriputta and the brethren are thus engaged.</p>

    <p class="f4">What if I were to extol the venerable Sāriputta in his presence with suitable verses?"</p>

    <p class="f4">So he rose from his seat,<br/> and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/> he bent his clasped hands saluting toward the venerable Sāriputta, and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is revealed to me, brother Sāriputta!<br/> it is revealed to me!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Be it revealed to thee, brother Vanglsa."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Vanglsa extolled him to his face<br/> in suitable verses: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"With insight [into mysteries] deep,<br/> And richly dowered with learned lore,<br/> Expert in methods true and false,<br/> The son of Sari,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> greatly wise,<br/> Teacheth the brethren in the Norm.<br/> He teacheth both in brief outline,<br/> And eke expounds in full detail.<br/> And like the myna-bird's<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> sweet song<br/> His exposition poureth forth.<br/> And while he teaches, they who hear<br/> His honeyed speech in tones they love<br/> Of voice enchanting, musical,<br/> With ravished ears, transported hearts<br/> Delighted, list his every word."</p>
