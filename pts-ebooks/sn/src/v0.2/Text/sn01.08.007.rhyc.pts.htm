    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> in the East Park,<br/> at the Terraced House of Migāra's Mother.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And with him was a great company of bhikkhus,<br/> even five hundred,<br/> all of them Arahants.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One,<br/> [presiding] on the fortnightly festival day<br/> at the Pavāraṇā ceremony,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> was seated in the open.</p>

    <p class="f4">And surveying the silent company of brethren,<br/> he addressed them:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, bhikkhus, I invite you:<br/> have ye not aught wherein you blame me,<br/> in deed or word?"</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus said, the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> rising from his seat,<br/> and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/> bent his clasped hands saluting toward the Exalted One<br/> and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Nay, lord, we blame the Exalted One<br/> in naught<br/> either in deed or in word.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the Exalted One doth cause a Way to arise<br/> where none had arisen,<br/> doth produce a Way<br/> that had not been brought about,<br/> doth declare a Way<br/> that had not been declared;<br/> he knoweth a Way,<br/> understandeth a Way,<br/> is expert in a Way,<br/> and now, lord,<br/> thy disciples following after thee,<br/> have made that Way their own.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">I too, lord, invite the Exalted One:<br/> is there not aught wherefore he blames me,<br/> in deed or in word?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Nay, Sāriputta,<br/> naught is there for which I blame thee,<br/> in deed or in word.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wise art thou, Sāriputta,<br/> comprehensive and manifold is thy wisdom,<br/> joyous and swift is thy wisdom,<br/> sharp and fastidious is thy wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as the eldest son<br/> of a king whose is the Wheel of Conquest<br/> rightly turns the Wheel<br/> as his father hath turned it,<br/> so, Sāriputta,<br/> dost thou rightly turn the Wheel Supreme of the Norm,<br/> even as I have turned it."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[243]</b></span> "If indeed, lord, the Exalted One have naught wherefore he blameth me,<br/> in deed or word,<br/> is there naught in these five hundred brethren wherefore the Exalted One blames them,<br/> in deed or word?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"There is naught, Sāriputta,<br/> for which I blame these five hundred, brethren,<br/> in deed or word.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these brethren,<br/> sixty have threefold lore,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> sixty have sixfold supernormal knowledge,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> sixty are emancipated in both ways,<br/> and the others are emancipated by insight [alone]."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṅgīsa,<br/> arising from his seat,<br/> and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/> bent his clasped hands saluting toward the Exalted One, and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is revealed to me, Exalted One!<br/> it is revealed to me, Blessed One!"</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Be it revealed to thee, Vaṅgīsa."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṅgīsa extolled the Exalted One in his presence with suitable verses: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"To-day on feast-day, for full purity,<br/> Five hundred brethren are together come.<br/> Such as have cut their fetters, cut their bonds<br/> Seers who are free from rebirth and from ill.<br/> And as a king who ruleth all the world,<br/> Surrounded by his councillors of state,<br/> Toureth around his empire everywhere,<br/> Driving throughout this earth that ends in sea,<br/> So him, who is our victor in the war,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/> The peerless Master of our caravan,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> We followers attend and wait upon,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[244]</b></span> Who hold the triple lore, slayers of death.<br/> All we are sons of the Exalted One;<br/> No sterile chaff<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> may amongst us be found.<br/> I worship him who strikes down craving's dart.<br/> I greet the offspring of the sun's great line."</p>
