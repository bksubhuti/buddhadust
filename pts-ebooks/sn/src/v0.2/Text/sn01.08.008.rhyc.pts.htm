    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at the Jeta Vana,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/> with a great company of twelve hundred and fifty brethren.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One was instructing,<br/> enlightening,<br/> inciting,<br/> and inspiring the brethren by a sermon bearing on Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">And those brethren, with their whole mind applied,<br/> attentive and intent,<br/> listened with rapt hearing to the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṅgīsa,<br/> arising from his seat,<br/> and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/> bent his clasped hands saluting toward the Exalted One, and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is revealed to me, Exalted One!<br/> it is revealed to me, Blessed One!"</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Be it revealed to thee, Vaṅgīsa." Then the venerable Vaṅgīsa extolled the Exalted One in his presence with suitable verses: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"A thousand brethren, yea, and more than these<br/> Attend around the Blessed One who here<br/> Doth teach the Norm, the passionless, the pure,<br/> Even Nibbāna, where can come no fear.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> They hearken to the Norm immaculate,<br/> Taught by the Enlightened One Supreme.<br/> 0 wondrous fair the All-enlightened shines<br/> 'Mid all the Band of brethren as their chief.<br/> Mysterious spirit<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> thou, Exalted One,<br/> The seventh in the lineage of the Seers,<br/> Like a great storm-cloud [in the summer sky]<br/> On thy disciples pouring plenteous rain.<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[245]</b></span> And one of these from siesta-musing come,<br/> Full fain his [gracious] Master to behold,<br/> Thy true disciple, mighty Hero [see!],<br/> Low at thy feet Vaṅgīsa worships thee."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Say now, Vaṅgīsa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> were these verses thought out by thee beforehand,<br/> or have they been revealed to thee just on the spot."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Nay, lord, these verses were not thought out by me beforehand;<br/> they were revealed to me just on the spot."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wherefore, Vaṅgīsa,<br/> let yet more verses,<br/> not thought out beforehand,<br/> be revealed to thee just on the spot."</p>

    <p class="f4">"So be it, lord," replied Vaṅgīsa,<br/> and in additional verses<br/> not thought out beforehand<br/> he extolled the Exalted One: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"O'er Māra's devious ways faring triumphant.<br/> Thou breakest up the fallows of our hearts.<br/> Behold him from all bondage our deliverer,<br/> Himself full fraught<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> the harvest he imparts.<br/> Yea, thou hast shown a Way by many methods<br/> For crossing o'er the torrent safe to land;<br/> And that Ambrosial thus manifested,<br/> Norm-seers<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> inexpugnable we stand.<br/> Light-bringer, he hath pierced beyond, beholding<br/> Past all those stations [where we end our flight],<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> The topmost height knowing and realizing,<br/> He showeth us that vantage-point of sight.<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[246]</b></span> Lo! now in truth so well revealed, for trifling<br/> What place is there for those who learn his Lore?<br/> Hence zealously within that Master's system<br/> Train ye alway, and while ye train, adore."</p>
