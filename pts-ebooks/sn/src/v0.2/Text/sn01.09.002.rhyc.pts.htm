    <p class="f4">A certain brother was once staying among the Kosalese<br/> in a certain forest tract.</p>

    <p class="f4">And during that time,<br/> while he took siesta,<br/> he would fall asleep.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a deva who haunted that forest tract,<br/> moved with compassion for that brother,<br/> desiring his welfare,<br/> and wishing to agitate him,<br/> drew near and addressed him in the verses: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Arise, good almsman, wherefore seek repose?<br/> What benefit dost thou in slumber find?<br/> Good for the sick is sleep, and for one pierced<br/> With wounds, for one that suffereth from shock.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> The faith and trust that made thee leave the world<br/> And give up home to live the homeless life —<br/> That faith shouldst thou develop and expand.<br/> But come not thou under the sway of sleep."</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Brother: —]<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Transient and fleeting are desires of sense<br/> For which slow wits infatuated long.<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[252]</b></span> Whoso is freed and leaneth not on bonds,<br/> The world well lost<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> — why should you plague the man?</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Whose insight is well cleansed and purified<br/> By the suppression of desire and lust,<br/> By the transcending of all ignorance,<br/> The world well lost — why should you plague the man?</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Where saving lore hath broken nescience,<br/> And poisons of the mind are wholly purged,<br/> A man who knows not sorrow or despair,<br/> The world well lost — why should you plague the man?</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">He that hath summoned effort, put forth strength,<br/> And ever maketh vigorous advance,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> Aspiring to Nibbāna's [blessed peace],<br/> The world well lost — why should you plague the man?"</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Upaṭṭhānaṁ.</i> The usual reference to the title does not occur in the Sutta. 'Ministry' probably refers to the fairy's well-meaning officiousness. The legend is that the bhikkhu who slept was an arahant, but that he had very far to go to procure himself any food and returned tired out.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Ruppato.</i> On this term <i>cf.</i> B.'s analysis given in my <i>Buddhist Psychology,</i> 1914, p. 43: 'disturbed, struck, hurt, broken,' namely by physical causes.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> B. confesses himself uncertain as to whether these lines belong to the brother, or the deva. 'It is not apparent in the commentary' (<i>ayan pan'ettha anuttāna-pādavaṇṇanā</i>). But if to the deva, the refrain implies 'why should he not plague himself, for he will [have to] do so?' namely, if he yield to somnolent habits.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Free rendering of <i>pabbajita</i> — the religieux, recluse, who has 'gone forth' from 'the world.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> See above, VII, 1, § 7.</p>
