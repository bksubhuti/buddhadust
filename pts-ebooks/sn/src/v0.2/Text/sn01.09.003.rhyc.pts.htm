    <p class="f4">The venerable Kassapa of the Kassapas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> was once staying among the Kosalese<br/> in a certain forest tract.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time,<br/> while taking siesta,<br/> the venerable Kassapa admonished a certain trapper.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then a deva who haunted that forest tract,<br/> moved with compassion for the Brother,<br/> desiring his welfare<br/> and wishing to agitate him,<br/> drew near and addressed the venerable Kassapa of the Kassapas in the verses: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Come stalking in the fastness of the hills,<br/> A silly trapper dull of intellect: —<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span> 'T is loss of time to admonish him. Methinks<br/> A brother doing so is slow of wit.<br/> He hears but does not understand; he looks<br/> But seeth not. Thou mayst recite the Norm,<br/> Yet will the fool not waken to his good.<br/> Nay, if thou were to bring of torches ten,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">31</a></sup></span><br/> 0 Kassapa, yet would he never see<br/> The things he should; 't is eyesight he doth lack."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Kassapa of the Kassapas,<br/> disturbed by that deva,<br/> was greatly moved.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> The legend runs that to test his attention the bhikkhu held up a luminous finger (<i>cf.</i> Dabba of the Mallas: <i>Vin. Texts,</i> iii, 4-18: <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> 10), hence the context.</p>
