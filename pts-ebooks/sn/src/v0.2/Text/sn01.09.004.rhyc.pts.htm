    <p class="f4">Many brethren were once staying among the Kosalese<br/> in a certain forest-tract.</p>

    <p class="f4">And at the close of the rains,<br/> when the three months [of Lent] were over,<br/> those brethren set out on tour.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the deva,<br/> indigenous to that forest,<br/> missed them,<br/> and lamenting,<br/> uttered in that hour the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"I see these many solitary seats,<br/> By learned men of varied discourse used.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> To-day regret and discontent are mine —<br/> Where are those Gotama-disciples gone?"</p>

    <p class="f4">When this had been said,<br/> a certain deva addressed this verse to him: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"They've gone to Magadha, to Kosala,<br/> And some into the Vajjian land have gone.<br/> As deer that roam untrapped at liberty,<br/> Owning no home the almsmen pass their time."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> These were not solitary students, but a school collectively and systematically engaged, according to B., in teaching and learning by heart the doctrines, and asking and answering questions, marking the hours by a bell (<i>gaṇḍi</i>).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The verses occur in <i>Mahāvastu,</i> 3, 420, 18, which reads <i>magakā</i> for <i>magā. Magā</i> occurs above, II, 2, § 1; <i>cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i, 173 f.; 306.</p>
