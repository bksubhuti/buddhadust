    <p class="f4">The venerable Ānanda was once staying among the Kosalese<br/> in a certain forest tract.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Ānanda<br/> was excessively busy<br/> imparting matters to the laity.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And a deva,<br/> indigenous to that forest,<br/> moved with compassion,<br/> desiring his welfare,<br/> and wishing to agitate him,<br/> drew near and addressed him in the verse:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Thou who hast plunged in leafy lair of trees,<br/> Suffering Nibbāna in thy heart to sink,<br/> Study, thou Gotamid, and dally not!<br/> What will this babble-babble do for thee?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br/> agitated by that deva,<br/> was greatly moved.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="demi"/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> According to the legend, this was just after the Master's <i>parinibāna,</i> shortly before Ānanda became Arahant. People knowing of his close attendance on his Master were ever asking him for details about the 'Great Decease,' mourning, and being admonished by him. He took the Buddha's bowl and robe about with him. Rebuke in the same verse is ascribed also to a Vajjian thera, Vajjiputta: <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> cxix.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> B. makes <i>biḷibiḷikā</i> refer directly to the 'talkee-talkee' noise of the laymen's conversation. <i>Cf.</i> Dhammapāla's explanation <i>op. cit. loc. cit.</i></p>
