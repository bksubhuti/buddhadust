    <p class="f4">The venerable Anuruddha was once staying among the Kosalese<br/> in a certain forest-tract.</p>

    <p class="f4">And a certain goddess of the heaven of the Thirty-and-three, named Jālinī,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> consort in a former birth to Anuruddha,<br/> came to visit him,<br/> and addressed him in the verses: -</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"There set thy heart's desire where erst for thee<br/> Was life, with the celestial Thirty-three,<br/> Whose is the attainment of all sense-desires,<br/> Where thou wast beauteous with thy retinue<br/> Of heavenly maids surrounding thee their lord?"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[255]</b></span> [Anuruddha: —]<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Ill-fated are such maids celestial,<br/> In their own sphere of life established.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> Ill-plighted, too, the beings are whose lot<br/> Brings them possession of these heavenly maids."</p>

    <p class="f4">[Jālinī<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span>: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"They know no bliss who see not Nandana,<br/> Abode of men and gods, renowned Thrice-Ten!"</p>

    <p class="f4">[Anuruddha: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Dost thou not know, 0 fool, how saints have said:<br/> 'Impermanent are all conditioned things.<br/> Their nature 't is to rise and pass away;<br/> When they have risen, then again they cease;<br/> Happy the mastery of them and the peace/<br/> Now is there no new dwelling-place for me<br/> In realms celestial, 0 Jālinī<br/> The endless line of birth is snapt in twain.<br/> Now can I never more become again."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Cf Pss. of the Brethren,</i> 329. She is, in our <i>Comy.</i>, said to have been his 'chief consort.' Anuruddha was first cousin to the Buddha.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The sense seems to require this distribution, but the <i>Comy.</i> is not explicit, and there is no <i>iti</i> to the preceding lines. However this is twice omitted in this Chapter (§§ 12, 14).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Sakkāyasmiṁ patiṭṭhitā. Kāya</i> (body) may be used for <i>nikāya,</i> group, society. One gathers that these celestial nymphs were destined to be reborn in the infernal regions. So B. both here and in I,5, § 6. They were 'fixed' herein for eight moral defects of character, he writes.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> She now gives the verse occurring in I, 2, § 1, Anuruddha responding with the corresponding retort, and adding the last four lines, which are given in his Gāthā, <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> ver. 908. I give a rendering different only in form.</p>
