    <p class="f4">A certain brother of the Vajjian clan<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> was once staying near Vesālī,<br/> in a certain forest-tract.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now an all-night festival<br/> took place at Vesali,<br/> and the brother,<br/> hearing the throb and thrum of the music<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> and the noise of voices,<br/> lamented,<br/> uttering in that hour the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Each by himself we in the forest dwell,<br/> Like a stripped log left lying<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> in the woods.<br/> On such a night as this [of revelry]<br/> Who more ill-plighted in their lot than we?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the deva who haunted that forest,<br/> moved with compassion for that brother,<br/> desiring his welfare,<br/> and wishing to agitate him,<br/> drew near and addressed him in the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[258]</b></span> "Thou by thyself dost in the forest dwell,<br/> Like a stripped log left lying in the woods.<br/> And many a one may envy thee thy lot,<br/> E'en as the hell-bound them that go to heaven."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then that brother, disturbed in mind by the deva, was greatly moved.</p>
