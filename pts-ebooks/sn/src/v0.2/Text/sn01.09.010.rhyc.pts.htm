    <p class="f4">A certain brother was once staying among the Kosalese<br/> in a certain forest-tract.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time this brother,<br/> whose life had been one of exceeding and abundant diligence,<br/> lived subsequently at ease,<br/> given to silence,<br/> and resigned.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the deva who haunted that forest-tract,<br/> moved with compassion for the brother,<br/> desiring his welfare,<br/> and wishing to agitate him,<br/> drew near and addressed him in the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"0 almsman! why dost thou not con and study<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> The doctrines all, while with the brethren biding.<br/> Who learns the Norm winneth heart's satisfaction,<br/> And in this life winneth men's commendation."</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Brother: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Ay, once was mine will to acquire those doctrines,<br/> Until I met with that Pure thing and Holy.<br/> Now since I met with that Pure thing and Holy,<br/> And understood worth of what sense can teach us,<br/> [One thing remained: —] laying all that on one side —<br/> So would the good speak of it [not as slackness]."</p>
