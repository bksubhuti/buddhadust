    <p class="f4">A certain brother was once staying among the Kosalese<br/> in a certain forest-tract.</p>

    <p class="f4">And at that time<br/> that brother was occupied<br/> during his siesta<br/> with evil and wrongful thoughts,<br/> to wit, with sensual, malevolent, and cruel thoughts.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the deva who haunted that forest-tract,<br/> moved with compassion for that brother,<br/> desiring his welfare,<br/> and wishing to agitate him,<br/> drew near and addressed him in the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Thou hast no thorough method in thy thought,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> Good sir, and hence art thou inebriate<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> With thine ideas. Renounce these muddled ways.<br/> Marshall thy thoughts in ordered governance<br/> Anent the Master, Norm, and Brotherhood;<br/> From virtue's code let there be no recoil.<br/> So shalt thou reach [the goal of] joy, of zest<br/> And bliss and full assurance.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> Thence in joy<br/> Abounding thou shalt make an end of i11.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then that brother, agitated by the deva,<br/> was greatly moved.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> It is never easy to find fit rendering for the important idiom <i>[a]yoniso manasikāra.</i> See p. 131, and <i>cf.</i> my <i>Buddhist Psychology</i> (1914), 123,160, and <i>cf.</i> the attempt in <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> ver. 269, etc.</p>

    <p class="in4">Thereat arose in me the deeper thought: —<br/> Attention to the fact and to the cause.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><i>Yoni</i> is <i>matrix,</i> source; <i>yoniso</i> is 'from' or <i>'qua' yoni</i> (the ablative). The other word (in the Suttas) is just 'work of mind.' B. often paraphrases <i>*ayoniso</i> by <i>an-upāya,</i> with [out] method, plan, system. 'Muddled ways' = <i>a-yoniṁ</i>.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Majjasi.</i> The indicative, as here, very rarely occurs.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Lit. the negative form: 'rid of doubt' (<i>a-saṅsayo</i>).</p>
