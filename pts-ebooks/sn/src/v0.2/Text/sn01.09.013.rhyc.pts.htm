    <p class="f4">A great number of brethren were once staying among the Kosalese<br/> in a certain forest-tract.</p>

    <p class="f4">And they were muddled in mind,<br/> puffed up,<br/> vain,<br/> noisy,<br/> loose of speech,<br/> heedless,<br/> unintelligent,<br/> without concentration,<br/> unsteady in mind,<br/> uncontrolled in faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the deva who haunted that forest,<br/> moved with compassion for those brethren,<br/> desiring their welfare,<br/> and wishing to agitate them,<br/> drew near and addressed them in the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Happy the bhikkhus as they lived of yore,<br/> Who true disciples were of Gotama.<br/> Unhankering they sought their frugal alms,<br/> Unhankering, their lodging and their couch.<br/> The impermanence of things they understood,<br/> And hence of misery they made an end.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Now, making evil-doers of themselves,<br/> Like headmen of the village [taking toll],<br/> Longing for what their neighbours' house contains,<br/> They eat and eat until they sink to rest.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The Order [as a whole] I humbly greet;<br/> To some of those here met I homage pay.<br/> Others, forlorn and leader-less are they,<br/> As cast out bodies of the dead are they.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">My message is for them who heedless live.<br/> To earnest diligent souls I say, All hail!"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then those brethren, agitated by the deva, were greatly moved.</p>
