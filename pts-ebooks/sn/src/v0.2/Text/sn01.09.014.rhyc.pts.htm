    <p class="f4">A certain brother was once staying among the Kosalese<br/> in a certain forest-tract.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now while there that brother,<br/> after he had returned from his alms-round and had broken his fast,<br/> plunged into the lotus-pool<br/> and sniffed up<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the perfume of a red lotus.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the deva who haunted that forest-tract,<br/> moved with compassion for that brother,<br/> desiring his welfare,<br/> and wishing to agitate him,<br/> drew near and addressed him in the verse: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"That blossom, child of water,<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> thing not given,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> Thou standest sniffing up the scent of it.<br/> This is one class of things that may be stolen.<br/> And thee a smell-thief must I call, dear sir."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[261]</b></span> [The Brother: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Nay, nought I bear away, I nothing break.<br/> Standing apart I smell the water's child.<br/> Now for what reason am I smell-thief called?<br/> One who doth dig up water-lilies, one<br/> Who feeds on lotuses, in motley tasks<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> Engaged: — why hast thou no such name for him?"</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Deva: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"A<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> man of ruthless, wicked character,<br/> Foul-flecked as is a handmaid's dirty cloth: —<br/> With such the words I say have no concern.<br/> But this't is meet that I should say [to thee]: —<br/> To him whose character is void of vice,<br/> Who ever maketh quest for what is pure: —<br/> What to the wicked but a hair-tip seems,<br/> To him doth great as any cloud<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> appear."</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Brother: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"In truth, 0 fairy, thou dost know me well,<br/> And kind compassion for me moved thy heart -<br/> I prithee, fairy, speak to me again<br/> Whenever thou dost see me do the like."</p>

    <p class="f4">[The Deva: —]</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Neither<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> am I dependent upon thee,<br/> Nor yet hath guilty deed by thee been done.<br/> But thou, 0 almsman, thou thyself shouldst know<br/> How thou to blissful destiny mayst go."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then that brother, agitated by the deva, was greatly moved.</p>
