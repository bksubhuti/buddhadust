    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once waiting near Gayā,<br/> on the Stone Couch,<br/> at the haunt of the yakkha Suciloma.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time<br/> Khara the yakkha and Suciloma the yakkha<br/> were passing by,<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Khara said to Suciloma:</p>

    <p class="f4">"That's a friar."</p>

    <p class="f4">"No [replied the other], that's not a friar,<br/> that's a mere shaveling,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> at least until I know<br/> that he's the one and not the other."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Suciloma came up to the Exalted One<br/> and bent his body up against him.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One bent his body away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Suciloma said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Dost fear me, friar?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Nay, friend, I fear thee not,<br/> albeit contact with thee is an evil thing."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[265]</b></span> "Friar, I will ask thee a question.</p>

    <p class="f4">"I see no one, friend,<br/> in the whole world,<br/> be he Māra or Brahmā,<br/> nor among gods or men<br/> with all the recluses and the brahmins,<br/> who is able to do to me<br/> any one of these things;<br/> nevertheless, friend,<br/> ask according to thy desire."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> An expressive statue of the yakkha Suciloma is among the bas-reliefs of the Bharhut Stupa (Cunningham, p. 136). It and those of other yakkhas compare favourably with presentations of devas. The Stone Couch is, in the <i>Sutta Nipāta Comy.</i> (i, 301), described as a long slab of rock resting on four upright rocks. Gaya comprised both a town and a landing-stage, and the Couch was at the latter, but not far from the town-gate. Here the Master sat, awaiting his two converts-to-be.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Samaṇa, samaṇaka,</i> the affix 'of appurtenance' here has, as is often the case, a diminutive and contemptuous value.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Fausböll's 'sinful' is misleading. B. says: 'shameful or unpleasant, to be avoided like dirt, fire, or a black snake, not to be acquiesced in by that golden-hued body,' so he 'bent away slightly as when one bends back the golden envelope of a piece of jewelry. Now the yakkha had hairs (<i>loma</i>) over the body like tapestry needles (<i>sūci</i>); these he erected, assuming a horrid shape with wide-opened mouth.' Khara is described as having scales like a crocodile's back. Both cases were results of thefts from 'the Order' in a former birth.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Either by making an appalling sight of himself before the Buddha, or by uttering fearful sounds, etc. <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> The verses are in <i>triṣṭhubh</i> metre, interrupted by two <i>ślokas</i>.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> The simile is explained by B. as I give it: Boys pass a string round a crow's leg and their finger, and pull it down in its flight; so our evil thoughts springing from ourselves are pulled back again into consciousness.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>Taṇhā-snehato jātā.</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>Ito attabhāvato jātā.</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>
