Then certain ascetic brethren, in ragged attire, almsmen, who had been touring singly, in pairs, or other numbers, came out from their quarters and, saluting, disposed themselves round the Teacher like the red swathing (round a jewel). He, discerning their wish, discoursed to them.</p>

'With daughter on hip and the boy's hand in hers, she comes round by the back fence or wall (<i>pakāra</i>) of the Grove to the entrance opposite the aisle (<i>vīthi</i>) leading to the Buddha's seat, and seeing the hushed rapt audience fancies some market transaction is being proposed, whence she may get scraps.' <i>Comy.</i></p>
