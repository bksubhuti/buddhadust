    <p class="f4">'If in you, dear sirs,<br/> when ye are gone into the battle,<br/> fear and panic<br/> and creeping of the flesh should arise,<br/> look up at the crest of my banner.</p>

    <p class="f4">If ye do so,<br/> any fear and panic<br/> and creeping of the flesh<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> that will have arisen<br/> will be overcome.</p>

    <p class="f4">If ye do so,<br/> any fear and panic<br/> and creeping of the flesh that will have arisen<br/> will be overcome.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, bhikkhus, in them that look up to the crest of one or other of these four banners,<br/> any fear and panic<br/> and creeping of the flesh that has arisen<br/> may be overcome,<br/> or again it may not.</p>

    <p class="f4">And why is this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because Sakka, ruler of the gods,<br/> is not purged of passions, hate, or ignorance,<br/> is timid,<br/> given to panic,<br/> to fright,<br/> to running away.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But I say thus unto you, bhikkhus:</p>

    <p class="f4">If in you<br/> when ye have gone into forests,<br/> to the roots of trees,<br/> to empty places,<br/> fear and panic and creeping of the flesh should arise,<br/> do ye in that hour only call me to mind and think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This, that is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> supremely enlightened,<br/> proficient in knowledge and in conduct,<br/> the Blessed One,<br/> who understands the world,<br/> peerless tamer and driver of the hearts of men,<br/> the Master,<br/> the Buddha for gods and men,<br/> Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">For if ye so call me to mind, bhikkhus,<br/> any fear,<br/> panic,<br/> creeping of the flesh that will have arisen<br/> will be overcome.</p>

    <p class="f4">And if ye cannot call me to mind,<br/> call to mind the Norm, and think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/> relating to the present,<br/> immediate in its results,<br/> inviting all,<br/> giving guidance,<br/> appealing to each,<br/> to be understood by them that can understand.'</p>

    <p class="f4">For if ye so call the Norm to mind<br/> your fear,<br/> panic,<br/> creeping of the flesh that will have arisen<br/> will be overcome.</p>

    <p class="f4">And if ye cannot call the Norm to mind,<br/> then call to mind the Order, and think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well practised is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br/> practised in integrity,<br/> in intellectual methods,<br/> in right lines of action — to wit<br/> the four pairs,<br/> the eight groups of persons<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span>: —<br/> this is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> oblations,<br/> gifts,<br/> salutations,<br/> the world's peerless field for merit.'</p>

    <p class="f4">For if ye so call the Order to mind,<br/> your fear,<br/> panic,<br/> creeping of the flesh will be overcome.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span> And why is this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because the Tathāgata, bhikkhus,<br/> Arahant<br/> Supremely Enlightened,<br/> is purged of passion,<br/> hate,<br/> ignorance,<br/> is without timidity<br/> or panic<br/> or fright,<br/> and fleeth not."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus said the Exalted One,<br/> and the Blessed One so saying,<br/> the Master spake yet further: —</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Whene'er in forest or in leafy shade<br/> Or lonely empty places ye abide,<br/> Call to your mind, bhikkhus, th'Enlightened One;<br/> No fear, no sense of peril will ye know.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Or if ye cannot on the Buddha think —<br/> The chief, the senior of the world, the Bull of men —<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/> Then call the Norm to mind, the well-taught guide.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Or if ye cannot think upon the Norm —<br/> The well-taught doctrine wherein guidance lies —<br/> Then turn your thoughts to the Fraternity,<br/> Unrivalled field where men may sow good deeds.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">If ye in Buddha, Order, Norm thus refuge take,<br/> Fear, panic, creeping of the flesh will never rise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sakka can in a moment<br/> think of a thousand matters,<br/> hence one of his names is<br/> 'Thousand-eyed' (sahass'akkha).</p>

    <p class="f4">Sakka became consort<br/> to the Asura maiden named Sujā,<br/> hence one of his names is<br/> 'Consort of Sujā' (Sujampati).</p>

    <p class="f4">Sakka rules over and governs<br/> the Thirty-three Gods,<br/> hence one of his name is<br/> 'Ruler of the Gods'.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the days, bhikkhus,<br/> when Sakka, ruler of the gods,<br/> was a man, he undertook and carried out<br/> seven rules of conduct,<br/> whereby he attained his celestial sovereignty.</p>

    <p class="f4">What were the seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">1. 'As long as I live,<br/> may I maintain my parents.</p>

    <p class="f4">2. As long as I live,<br/> may I revere the head of the family.</p>

    <p class="f4">3. As long as I live,<br/> may I use gentle language.</p>

    <p class="f4">4. As long as I live,<br/> may I utter no slander.</p>

    <p class="f4">5. As long as I live,<br/> with a mind rid of stain and selfishness,<br/> may I conduct myself in the home<br/> with generosity,<br/> with clean hands,<br/> delighting in renunciation,<br/> amenable to petitions,<br/> delighting in sharing gifts.</p>

    <p class="f4">6. As long as i live,<br/> may I speak the truth.</p>

    <p class="f4">7. As long as I live,<br/> may I not give way to anger:<br/> if anger should rise,<br/> may I swiftly repress it.'</p>

    <p class="f4">By undertaking and carrying out these rules<br/> when he was a human being,<br/> Sakka attained his celestial position."</p>

    <p class="f4">But Sakka spoke to them saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now in proportion as they became annoyed,<br/> vexed,<br/> indignant,<br/> that yakkha grew ever handsomer<br/> and more presentable<br/> and more attractive.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then they went and told Sakka what had happened.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ad they asked:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Will this, then, dear sir,<br/> be a yakkha who feeds on anger?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Sakka came up to that anger-nourished yakkha,<br/> and draping his robe over one shoulder,<br/> and kneeling on his right knee,<br/> bent forth his clasped hands towards him,<br/> calling his own name thrice:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now in proportion, as Sakka did this,<br/> that yakkha became more and more ill-favoured<br/> and dwarfed<br/> and pot-bellied,<br/> till he vanished there and then.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Sakka, taking his seat on his throne,<br/> appeasing the Thirty-three Gods in that hour,<br/> addressed them in these verses: —</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> B. seems to be ignorant of the bygone lustre of the word Asura — as = Ahura [mazda], and a name of title of Varuṇa He gives his traditional version of the immediate antecedents of Sakka, as a virtuous, public-spirited citizen of a Magadha village, and of his rebirth in the lowest deva-world (on Mt. Sineru, or Meru) as its King. Other versions are given in the Kulāvaka Jātaka (No. 31) and in the Mahāli-pañha story of the <i>Comy.</i> on <i>Dhp.</i> ver. 30 (i, 263 <i>f.</i>). Merely touching on the good works of Sakka as the brahmin Magha, and on his seven Rules of Conduct (see 2, §1 below), he names 33, not 30 co-operating fellow-citizens who were also reborn, as they died, in the same heaven, as if wishing it to be inferred that these became the '33 gods' immediately beneath Sakka (see below, §3). We may presume that, for Buddhists, the thrones and powers of the 33 were relative permanencies, like the Sakkatta (Sakka-hood) of Sakka, occupied successively by long-lived devas. B.'s version of the Asura wars is, that certain devas tried to get the vigorous and virtuous new rulers into their power by doping them with <i>gaṇḍapāna.</i> Sakka warned his comrades to abstain; the plotters alone got dead drunk and were thrown down Sineru. They formed a kingdom below, and lived <i>a-sura,</i> without strong drink, trying from time to time to regain the lost Paradise.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> We do not meet elsewhere with Suvīra.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>A-kammena.</i> B. is singularly wanting over these interesting verses, combining as they do (1) the doctrine of the non-accumulation of Karma (cf. p. 301, n. 2), good or bad, with (2) the primary importance of strenuous persevering activity of a right sort: training in the Paths for no earthly or celestial reward.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> He is called Sakka's son; presumably the Susīma, son of the devas, of II, 3, §9.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> This Sutta was translated by the late E.R. Gooneratne in the <i>Ceylon National Review,</i> 1906. No graphic device is described by B. as forming the <i>agga,</i> or crest of the banner of these vast devas — Sakka's was 250 <i>yojanas</i> in length, himself and his chariot of proportional size — but from it the wind elicited music. Hence it served both as a bagpipes and as a visible rallying point.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> This triplet of terms occurs in the Māra and Bhikkhunī Suttas, but not in the other Nikāyas.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> This interesting trio are represented as invoked in the Tevijja Sutta, <i>Dialogues,</i> i, 310. On the first three, see Macdonell's <i>Vedic Mythology.</i> Isāna is an older name for Rudra, called euphemistically Siva (Böthlingk and Roth). So distorted had their myths become for B., that he assigns them places immediately below Sakka, and hence presumably among the 33!</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> See this sequence of terms, III, 3, §4.</p>

By thought only was he bound by them, by thought <i>(cittena)</i> only was he loosed.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a></sup> B.'s list of scurrilous epithets is not without interest: 'Thou art a thief, a fool, a bungler <i>(mūḷho)</i>, a camel, a bullock, a donkey, a hell-man, a beast; there's neither heaven nor hell to be expected by such as thou.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a></sup> The metaphors are a little mixed. <i>Ajjhārūhati (= ajjhottharati)</i>, 'press you hard,' is to climb on to and over you,' 'spread over,' and is used for <i>e.g.</i> parasitic plants. <i>Jāt.</i> iii, 399.

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a></sup> Here is another instance of the use of the pregnant term <i>attha</i> in two shades of meaning. The Pali pada is <i>sadattha-paramā atthā.</i> (<i>Cf.</i> above, X, §12.) I take <i>sad-attha- (sakattha-, Comy.)</i> in the sense of <i>vuddhi,</i> '[spiritual] growth,' and <i>atthā</i> in the sense of <i>kāraṇā,</i> 'matters,' 'grounds,''causes.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a></sup> These verses occurred in VII, 1, §§2,3.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a></sup> There is a pleasant humour in putting into Vepacitti's mouth the verses in which Mātali arraigned him (see §4), but this is lost on B.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a></sup> I take the positive forms; none of the negatives given in the Pali: non-force, etc. — would appeal to us who prefer positive forms of expression.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a></sup> Here the <i>Comy.</i> gives, in its own words, another portion of the <i>Kulāvaka Jātaka</i> (see above, p. 279, n.1).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a></sup> The <i>Simbali Vana,</i> Silk-cotton-tree Wood (<i>Bombax Heptaphyllum</i>, according to the Wilsonian botanical lore incorporated by Childers in his Dictionary) stood on the slope of Mt. Sineru, and was the abode of Garuḍa or roc-birds (<i>cf.</i> VI, 1, §6). These were great creatures, hence their nests torn by the enormous chariot-pole of the deva's chariot is not a fancy so out of proportion as it might at first seem.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a></sup> B. instances Devadatta's case.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a></sup> Presumably a name of <i>Vepacitti,</i> meaning the Shining One or sun. B. passes him over. In the text-summary he is <i>Virocano.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> above, VI, 1, §§7,8.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a></sup> Once more the elusive <i>*attha.</i> B. here paraphrases it by <i>kicca;</i> function, task, duty, something to be done, a meaning he did not include in the six given above (X, §12). <i>Atthajātā ti kiccajātā.</i> 'From dogs and jackals upward, there is no being who is <i>a-kiccajāto.</i> (Is this 'born without a task,' or 'for whom no function has arisen'?). His definition comes nearest to that meaning which he calls <i>'vicakkhaṇa,'</i> and means 'discerned need': <i>atthi me attho</i>... 'I need. ...'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a></sup> The figure is a little obscure; the achieved task is likened to a skilfully compounded, well-cooked rice-pudding, not fit to be eaten till ready.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a></sup> B. places this in the Himālayas in a charming spot fitted with day and night 'cloisters' etc. These two persons, father- and son-in-law <i>(janā jāmātika-sasurā),</i> he goes on, were sometimes at war, sometimes in concord <i>(ekato caranti)</i>; just then they were the latter.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a></sup> B. explains <i>aṭaliyo</i> as <i>gaṇangaṇūpāhanā. Cf. Vin. Texts</i> ii, 14, n. 1: — 'with many linings' (?soles). My guess is that they were buskins, state-footwear, or war ditto. The word occurs in the <i>Assalāyana-Sutta</i> (M. ii, 155), where B. has the same comment.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a></sup> <i>I.e.</i> a 'non-fear-gift.' <i>Bhaya</i> has the double sense of 'fear' and 'thing feared' or 'peril.' The gift apparently consisted simply in the king's promise to give orders for their being unmolested, when the fighting came their way. Sakka, B. says, had already conferred <i>(mantetvā)</i> with the Rishis, and the Asuras, wrathful lest this meant an enlisting of Rishis' magic powers, had on one occasion smashed up their hermitage.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a></sup> And this, writes B. graphically amplifying the slender narrative of Sambara's nightmares, is how, his mind getting deranged <i>(vipati-citto),</i> he came to be called Vepacitti (crazy-nerve). <i>Cf.</i> below, 3, §3. That Rishis, armed with their weapon of effective cursing, should seek protection seems incongruous, but it is a common trait in the European fairy-story for the witch, etc., to crave a boon.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a></sup> Lit. the 'thousand-yoked thoroughbred-chariot.' On 'thousand' associated with Sakka, <i>cf.</i> two of his names above (2, §2). Possibly a term of solar-myth origin. 'Bred' is here to be understood in the sense of being thoroughly trained, of 'good breeding,' rather than 'good pedigree.' Possibly it needed a horse of good strain to achieve that rational development claimed by B. (and the Pali term) for a highly trained horse. See above, pp.11, <i>n.</i> 1; and 38 (iii).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a></sup> These terms, writes B., may refer to the material matrix, or to their own bodies. The gods were animistic, as was shown in the First Chapter, and would speak naturally of the man, soul, self, as 'immersed in' the body.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a></sup> These verses resemble Rohinī's apologia for recluses (<i>Sisters,</i> LXVII). Three of the lines: 'In granary, etc.' are included in her verses. But Pischel's edition (PTS) of the <i>Therigāthā</i> gives <i>pariniṭṭhitaṅ</i> 'completed,' where the <i>Saṁyutta</i> has <i>paraniṭṭhitaṅ,</i> 'made ready by another.' Their alms, explains B., are 'cooked' in 'other' folk's houses, made ready by 'others' — an earthy, but safer substitute for the loftier (and grammatically forced) guess of my earlier translation.<br/> Again, the <i>Therīgāthā</i> has <i>osenti</i> for <i>openti = pa'ikkhipanti:</i> 'deposit' ('hoard').</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a></sup> B. is silent over this not very obvious clause. But I think Feer is right and Warren wrong: 'And ne'er proclaim my virtue's fame' <i>(dhammāni).</i> This neuter plural is not unknown, but the proclaiming is precisely what the dear good god was doing! I read <i>dhammā</i> as equivalent to the instrumental <i>dhammena.</i> And <i>nikittaye,</i> 'I may not be false, or inconsistent to,' is good Sanskrit, though not yet found in Pali. Sakka's <i>dhamma</i> (norm or creed) was especially Forbearance.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a></sup> <i>Sambari(yā) māyā.</i> Juggling, or ? white magic is all that <i>māyā</i> ever means in early buddhist literature of in Theravāda literature. <i>Asura-vidyā</i> is used in the <i>.Srauta Sūtras</i> as a synonym for <i>māyā.</i> See Vedic Index, Macdonell and Keith, s.v.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a></sup> Here is apparently a curious anomaly in B.'s comments. (1) He has told us that Vepacitti's real name was Sambara, Inda, or ruler of the Asuras (1, §10). (2) He calls the magician or conjurer whose art is known to Vepacitti, or is Vepacitti's, and who practised it, with direful results, Sambaro Asurindo. (3) He explains the last line as 'Sambara ruler of Asuras, a juggler, who, having practised <i>māyā (māyāvī māyaṅ payojetvā)</i> is "roasting" since a century ago in purgatory:' — and all without making any distinction between any two Sambaras. The only inference is that there was a post of Sambaratta (Sambarahood) as there was of Sakkatta (Sakka-hood), and that the 'late' ruler of the Asuras had an art which was either an heirloom taught to, or an innate talent possessed by each succeeding Sambara. But what an opportunity for our good B. to have missed!<br/> The Asuras naturally fear to put more power into Sakka's hands: — 'he will torment us, destroy us!' Vepacitti advises him and his, as honest men <i>(tumhe dhammikā va),</i> to keep clear of it <i>(alaṅ vo na māyāya).</i> The legend adds that Sakka's other offer of healing was to take Vepacitti to beg pardon of the Rishis. But to the champion of 'frightfulness' this was too much.</p>
