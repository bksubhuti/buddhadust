    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, brethren,<br/> I will analyse<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the causal law.</p>

    <p class="f4">Listen to it,<br/> give your minds thoroughly<br/> and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord," responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What, brethren, is the causal law?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br/> conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/> conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/> conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br/> conditioned by sense contact,<br/> conditioned by contact feeling,<br/> conditioned by feeling craving,<br/> conditioned by craving grasping,<br/> conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/> conditioned by becoming birth,<br/> conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called [causal] happening.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is old age-and-death?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That which, of this and that being,<br/> in this and that group,<br/> is decay,<br/> decrepitude,<br/> breaking up,<br/> hoariness,<br/> wrinkling of the skin,<br/> shrinkage of a life-span,<br/> over-ripeness of faculties:<br/> this is called old age.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which, of this and that being<br/> from this or that group,<br/> is falling or decease,<br/> separation,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> disappearance,<br/> mortality or dying,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> accomplishment of time:<br/> separation<span class="f3"><sup>5</sup></span> of component factors,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> laying down of the carcase:<br/> this is called death.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is this decay<br/> and this dying<br/> that is called old age-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is birth?</p>

    <p class="f4">That which, of this and that being<br/> in this and that group,<br/> is birth,<br/> continuous birth,<br/> descent,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> reproduction,<br/> appearance of component factors,<br/> acquiring of sense-spheres.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is becoming?</p>

    <p class="f4">Three are these becomings:<br/> becoming in Kāma-[worlds],<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/> becoming in Rūpa-[worlds],<br/> becoming in Arūpa-[worlds].</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is grasping?</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these four graspings:<br/> grasping of desires,<br/> grasping of opinion,<br/> grasping of rule and ritual,<br/> grasping of soul-theory.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is craving?</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these six groups of craving:<br/> craving for things seen,<br/> for things heard,<br/> for odours,<br/> for tastes,<br/> for things tangible,<br/> for ideas.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is feeling?</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these six groups of feeling:<br/> feeling that is born of eye-contact,<br/> feeling that is born of ear-contact,<br/> feeling that is born of nose-contact,<br/> feeling that is born of tongue-contact,<br/> feeling that is born of body-contact,<br/> feeling that is born of mind-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is contact?</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these six groups of contact:<br/> eye-contact,<br/> ear-contact,<br/> nose-contact,<br/> tongue-contact,<br/> body-contact,<br/> mind-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is sixfold sense?</p>

    <p class="f4">The sense of eye,<br/> ear,<br/> nose,<br/> tongue,<br/> body,<br/> mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called sixfold sense.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is name-and-shape?</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling,<br/> perception,<br/> will,<br/> contact,<br/> work of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called name.</p>

    <p class="f4">The four great elements<br/> and the shape derived from them.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called shape.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the name,<br/> this is the shape<br/> called name-and-shape.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is consciousness?</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the six groups of consciousness:<br/> eye-consciousness,<br/> ear-consciousness,<br/> smell-consciousness,<br/> taste-consciousness,<br/> touch-consciousness,<br/> and mind-consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what are activities?</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the three activities:<br/> those of deed,<br/> speech<br/> and mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is ignorance?</p>

    <p class="f4">Nescience concerning ill,<br/> its rise,<br/> its cessation<br/> and concerning the way going to the cessation of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called ignorance.</p>

    <p class="f4">So thus, brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance<br/> activities come to pass;<br/> conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/> conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/> conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br/> conditioned by sense contact,<br/> conditioned by contact feeling,<br/> conditioned by feeling craving,<br/> conditioned by craving grasping,<br/> conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/> conditioned by becoming birth,<br/> conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance<br/> [comes] ceasing of activities;<br/> from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/> from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/> from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br/> from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br/> from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/> from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/> from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/> from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/> from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/> from ceasing of birth,<br/> old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The text here and frequently in following Suttas merely gives '...staying at Sāvatthī...' eliding the rest.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Vibhajissāmi.</i> The Order of the Sākya Gotama became known betimes as that of the Vibhajjavādins, or Analysis-school. <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> ii (#99: Subha Sutta). p. 197: <i>Points of Controversy,</i> xxxviii, xl, f.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> The formula of the 'coming to pass' or former section is here repeated in full. See §1. [Ed., in this edition it is restored per the previous sutta.]</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Dialogues of the Buddha,</i> ii, 338. 'Old age' = 'decay' = <i>jarā.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Bhedo,</i> lit. breakage. It has a wider meaning than the 'breaking up' <i>(khaṇḍiccaṁ)</i> in the preceding sentence, being useed for both 'division' and 'schism.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Maccumaraṇaṁ: —</i> 'that is, the dying known as maccu (mortal). By this he rejects dying as an annihilation.' <i>Comy.</i> Hence <i>maccu</i> (Sanskrit, <i>m.rityu</i>) must have been a word <i>associated with</i> the doctrine of rebirth.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Component factors = <i>khandha's,</i> literally, heaps, aggregates, mental and bodily.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> 'As if descending, entering, they take conception.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> I leave these terms untranslated. Briefly <i>kāma</i> (desire associated with sense) connotes existence in purgatory, or as animal, or as <i>peta (manes),</i> or as man, or as <i>deva</i> in the nearer worlds akin to earth. <i>Rūpa</i> (visible form) connotes existence in the further Brahma-, and super-Brahma-world. <i>Arūpa</i> (invisible or incorporeal) refers to worlds of abstract conceptions, never in any degree concretely apprehended.</p>
