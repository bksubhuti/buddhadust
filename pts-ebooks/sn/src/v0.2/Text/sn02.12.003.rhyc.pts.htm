    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, brethren, both the wrong way and the right way.</p>

    <p class="f4">Listen to it,<br/> give your minds thoroughly<br/> and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord," responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Which, brethren, is the wrong way?</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br/> conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/> conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/> conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br/> conditioned by sense contact,<br/> conditioned by contact feeling,<br/> conditioned by feeling craving,<br/> conditioned by craving grasping,<br/> conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/> conditioned by becoming birth,<br/> conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, is called the wrong way.</p>

    <p class="f4">And which is the right way?</p>

    <p class="f4">From the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br/> from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/> from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/> from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br/> from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br/> from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/> from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/> from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/> from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/> from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/> from ceasing of birth,<br/> old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called the right way.</p>
