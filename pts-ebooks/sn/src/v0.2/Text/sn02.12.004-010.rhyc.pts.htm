Here commencing in the same way Gotama gives also his own similar experience, though the compilation is, in the middle, condensed, as I have condensed above. <i>[Ed.: Although the Pali abbreviates, it does so with 'pe' indicating that the missing sections were present in the original — in other words were not originally teachings in brief or summaries.
