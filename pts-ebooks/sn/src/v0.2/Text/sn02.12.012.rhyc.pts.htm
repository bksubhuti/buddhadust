    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park:</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are these four sustenances, brethren,<br/> for the maintenance of beings<br/> that have come to birth<br/> or for the forwarding of them<br/> that seek to become.</p>

    <p class="f4">Which are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Material food,<br/> coarse or fine, <br/> secondly, contact, <br/> thirdly, volition,<br/> fourthly, consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">These four are the sustenances<br/> for the maintenance of beings<br/> that have come to birth,<br/> or for the forwarding of those<br/> that seek to become."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moḷiya-Phagguna<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Who now is it, lord,<br/> who feeds on the consciousness-sustenance?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Not a fit question," said the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am not saying [someone] feeds on.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were saying so,<br/> to that the question would be a fit one.</p>

    <p class="f4">But I am not saying so.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I not saying so,<br/> if you were to ask me</p>

    <p class="f4">'Of what<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> now, lord,<br/> is consciousness the sustenance?'</p>

    <p class="f4">this were a fit question.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the fit answer to it is:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The consciousness-sustenance<br/> is the cause of renewed becoming,<br/> of rebirth in the future.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When that <span class="f2 g"><b>[10]</b></span> is come to pass,<br/> is present,<br/> the sixfold sense-sphere becomes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by the sixfold sense-sphere<br/> contact becomes."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Who now, lord, exercises contact?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not a fit question," said the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am not saying [someone] exercises contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were saying so,<br/> the question would be a fit one.</p>

    <p class="f4">But I am not saying so.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I not saying so,<br/> if you were to ask thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Conditioned now by what, lord,<br/> is contact?'</p>

    <p class="f4">this were a fit question.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the fit answer there would be:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Conditioned by the sixfold sense-sphere<br/> is contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by contact is feeling.'"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Who now, lord, is it who feels?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not a fit question, said the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were saying so,<br/> the question would be a fit one.</p>

    <p class="f4">But I am not saying so.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the fit answer there would be:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Conditioned by contact is feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by feeling<br/> is craving.'"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Who now, lord, is it who craves?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Not a fit question," said the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am not saying [someone] craves.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were saying so,<br/> the question would be a fit one.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the fit answer there would be:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Conditioned by feeling<br/> is craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by craving<br/> is grasping.'"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Who now, lord, is it who grasps?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not a fit question, said the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not saying [someone] grasps.</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were saying so, the question would be a fit one.</p>

    <p class="f4">But I am not saying so.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I not saying so, if you were to ask thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Conditioned now by what, lord,<br/> is there grasping?'</p>

    <p class="f4">this were a fit question.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the fit answer there would be:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Conditioned by craving<br/> is grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by grasping<br/> is becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">conditioned by becoming, birth;<br/> conditioned by birth,<br/> old-age-and-death,<br/> grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair<br/> come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising<br/> of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and cessation<br/> of the sixfold <span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span> sphere of sense-contact, Phagguna,<br/> comes cessation of contact,<br/> from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/> from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/> from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/> from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/> from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/> from ceasing of birth,<br/> old age-and-death,<br/> grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair<br/> cease.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Moliya</i> = adj. of <i>molī,</i> or <i>cūḷa,</i> the hair, grown long, dressed on top of the head and adorned with a jewelled caboche or what not. (The turban is <i>niveṭhana.</i>) <i>Cf.</i> <i>Jāt.</i> i, 65 (<i>Bud. Birth-stories</i>, p. 86). In this case 'he wore when in the world a large coiffure and was called after it.' <i>Comy.</i> On the man see below, p. 38, Majjhima i, 122. On this Sutta see <i>Bud.

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> B. as if to leave no ambiguity here paraphrases '<i>ko ... viññāṇāhāraṁ āhāreti</i> by <i>ko nāma so yo etaṁ viññāṇāhāraṁ khādati vā bhunjati vā ti.</i> See Introduction. Why, asks the <i>Comy.,</i> does he leave out the other three? Because they are more obvious conditions of effects. He could see anyone eating food, could easily understand contact-sustenance, say, of a bird feeding its young, and thoughtful volition as when a turtle lays her eggs in sand above high water mark. But the (new and yet old) mind, that will continue to function in a new body in the process of rebirth, was not so easy to bring under the notion of a 'sustenance,' which conditions the appearance of a new compound or name-and-shape.</p>
