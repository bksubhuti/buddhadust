    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"For the fool, brethren,<br/> cloaked by ignorance<br/> and tied to craving,<br/> this body is wrought on this wise:</p>

    <p class="f4">There is just this body<br/> and names-and-shapes without:<br/> thus this pair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of the pair [there is] contact,<br/> just six spheres of sense.</p>

    <p class="f4">Touched by these,<br/> or by one of them,<br/> the fool experiences pleasure and pain.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">For the wise man, brethren,<br/> cloaked by ignorance<br/> and tied to craving<br/> this body is wrought on this wise:</p>

    <p class="f4">There is just this body<br/> and names-and-shapes without:<br/> thus this pair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of the pair [there is] contact,<br/> just six spheres of sense.</p>

    <p class="f4">Touched by these,<br/> or by one of them,<br/> the wise man experiences pleasure and pain.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">What, brethren, is there here that is different,<br/> distinctive,<br/> diverse<br/> between the wise man and the fool?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root,<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br/> if the meaning <span class="f2 g"><b>[20]</b></span> of this that he has spoken<br/> were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/> the brethren will remember it."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, brethren,<br/> listen,<br/> give your mind thoroughly<br/> and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/> responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The ignorance, brethren,<br/> wherewith the fool,<br/> whose body is so wrought,<br/> is cloaked,<br/> the craving whereto he is tied,<br/> that ignorance the fool has not thrown off,<br/> that craving is not withered away.</p>

    <p class="f4">How is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">The fool has not lived the divine life<br/> for the right withering away of ill,<br/> therefore the fool<br/> at the breaking up of the body<br/> is on his way to [another]<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> body.</p>

    <p class="f4">He being on his way thither<br/> is not set free from birth,<br/> nor from old age<br/> and death,<br/> nor from grievings,<br/> from lamentings,<br/> from ills,<br/> from sorrows,<br/> from despairs -</p>

    <p class="f4">I say, he is not set free from Ill.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The ignorance, brethren,<br/> wherewith the wise man,<br/> whose body is so wrought,<br/> is cloaked,<br/> the craving whereto he is tied,<br/> that ignorance the wise man has thrown off,<br/> and that craving is withered away.</p>

    <p class="f4">How is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">The wise man has lived the divine life<br/> for the right withering away of ill,<br/> therefore the wise man<br/> at the breaking up of the body<br/> is not on his way to [another sense-] body.</p>

    <p class="f4">He not being on his way thither<br/> is set free from rebirth,<br/> from old age<br/> and death,<br/> from grievings,<br/> from lamentings,<br/> from ills,<br/> from sorrows,<br/> from despairs -</p>

    <p class="f4">I say, he is set free from Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is how the wise man is different,<br/> distinctive,<br/> diverse from the fool,<br/> namely in that he lives the divine life."</p>
