    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, brethren,<br/> both causal happening<br/> and things as having causally happened.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[21]</b></span> "Even so, lord",<br/> those brethren made response to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">He said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by rebirth is decay and death:</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> On these four phrases the <i>Comy.</i> has: - '<i>ṭhitā va sā dhātu,</i> this - causality (causal state) just stands; there is nowhere any birth, old age, death without cause <i>(paccayo);</i> by the next two phrases he teaches just cause; namely, by cause arisen phenomena <i>(dhammā)</i> persist, (or stand), therefore cause is called 'causal status.' Cause orders (or fixes) phenomena, therefore it is called orderliness of phenomena. The causes of birth, etc., are specific ("this") causes, and specific causes are just this-relatedness.'</p>
