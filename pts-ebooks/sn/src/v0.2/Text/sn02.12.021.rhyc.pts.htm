    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Tathāgata, brethren,<br/> endowed with the ten powers,<br/> and the four confidences,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> claims the Place of the Bull;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> he roars the Lion's Roar amid the congregations;<br/> he turns the Divine Wheel,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Such is material shape,<br/> such is its arising,<br/> such is its passing away;</p>

    <p class="f4">such is feeling,<br/> such is its arising,<br/> such is its passing away;</p>

    <p class="f4">such is perception,<br/> such is its arising,<br/> such is its passing away;</p>

    <p class="f4">such are activities,<br/> such is its arising,<br/> such is its passing away;</p>

    <p class="f4">such is consciousness,<br/> such is its arising,<br/> such is its passing away.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This' being,<br/> 'that' becomes;<br/> from the arising of this,<br/> that arises;<br/> this not being,<br/> that becomes not;<br/> from the ceasing of this,<br/> that ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is to say,<br/> conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br/> conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/> conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/> conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br/> conditioned by sense contact,<br/> conditioned by contact feeling,<br/> conditioned by feeling craving,<br/> conditioned by craving grasping,<br/> conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/> conditioned by becoming birth,<br/> conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br/> from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/> from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/> from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br/> from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br/> from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/> from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/> from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/> from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/> from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/> from ceasing of birth,<br/> old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>
