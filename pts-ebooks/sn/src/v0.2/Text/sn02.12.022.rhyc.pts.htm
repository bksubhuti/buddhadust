    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Tathāgata, brethren,<br/> endowed with the ten powers,<br/> and the four confidences,<br/> claims the Place of the Bull;<br/> he roars the Lion's Roar amid the congregations;<br/> he turns the Divine Wheel,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Such is material shape,<br/> such is its arising,<br/> such is its passing away;</p>

    <p class="f4">such is feeling,<br/> such is its arising,<br/> such is its passing away;</p>

    <p class="f4">such is perception,<br/> such is its arising,<br/> such is its passing away;</p>

    <p class="f4">such are activities,<br/> such is its arising,<br/> such is its passing away;</p>

    <p class="f4">such is consciousness,<br/> such is its arising,<br/> such is its passing away.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This' being,<br/> 'that' becomes;<br/> from the arising of this,<br/> that arises;<br/> this not being,<br/> that becomes not;<br/> from the ceasing of this,<br/> that ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is to say,<br/> Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br/> conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/> conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/> conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br/> conditioned by sense contact,<br/> conditioned by contact feeling,<br/> conditioned by feeling craving,<br/> conditioned by craving <span class="f2 g"><b>[24]</b></span> grasping,<br/> conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/> conditioned by becoming birth,<br/> conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br/> from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/> from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/> from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br/> from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br/> from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/> from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/> from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/> from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/> from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/> from ceasing of birth,<br/> old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus, brethren, the Norm being well declared by me,<br/> made manifest,<br/> disclosed,<br/> brought to light,<br/> stripped of its swathings,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> it is enough for the clansman<br/> who has left the world through faith<br/> to stir up energy<br/> and vow:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Verily let skin and sinews and bones wilt in my body,<br/> let flesh and blood dry up,<br/> yet shall there be upkeep of energy<br/> till I have won<br/> that which by man's strength,<br/> by man's energy,<br/> by man's progress<br/> may be won!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Sadly, brethren,<br/> lives the man of sloth,<br/> involved in bad,<br/> wicked things.</p>

    <p class="f4">Great is the salvation<br/> which he fails to win.</p>

    <p class="f4">But he of stirred up energy<br/> lives happily,<br/> aloof from bad,<br/> wicked things.</p>

    <p class="f4">Great is the salvation<br/> that he makes perfect.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not by that which is low, brethren,<br/> may the highest be won;<br/> by that which is highest<br/> may the highest be won.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of praise, brethren,<br/> is this divine life.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Teacher has come to you<br/> face to face.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore stir up energy<br/> that ye may win<br/> what is not won,<br/> that ye may attain<br/> what is not attained,<br/> that ye may realize<br/> what is unrealized.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus will this<br/> our leaving the world<br/> not be barren,<br/> but a fruitful<br/> and a growing thing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily the necessaries that we enjoy:<br/> the equipment of robes,<br/> alms,<br/> lodging<br/> and medicine,<br/> though they be humble,<br/> shall be to us<br/> of great profit<br/> and advantage.'</p>

    <p class="f4">For thus, brethren,<br/> must ye train yourselves:</p>

    <p class="f4">If a man discern his own good,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> this is enough to call up earnestness;<br/> if <span class="f2 g"><b>[25]</b></span> he discern another's good,<br/> this is enough to call up earnestness;<br/> if he discern both his own and another's good,<br/> this is enough to call up earnestness.</p>
