    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta clothed himself one morning,<br/> and taking his bowl and cloak<br/> entered Rājagaha on his alms-round.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now he thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is too early as yet<br/> to go <span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span> about Rājagaha for alms:<br/> I might go the gardens of the heretical Wanderers."</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta came to those gardens,<br/> and after exchanging greetings with those heretical Wanderers<br/> and compliments of friendship and courtesy<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then those Wanderers spoke thus<br/> to the venerable Sāriputta so seated:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are, friend Sāriputta,<br/> certain recluses and brahmins,<br/> believers in karma,<br/> who declare that ill is self-wrought;<br/> certain others of them<br/> declare ill is wrought by some one other [than one's self];<br/> certain others declare that ill is wrought by both,<br/> and certain others<br/> that ill is wrought by neither,<br/> but happens by chance.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the recluse Gotama -<br/> what does he declare,<br/> what does he announce?</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, if we were answering,<br/> should we be repeating the views of the recluse Gotama,<br/> and should not be misrepresenting him<br/> by what is not correct,<br/> but should be answering<br/> by a doctrine in conformity with his doctrine,<br/> and [one whereby] no one who is of his doctrine,<br/> a follower of his views,<br/> would render himself open to blame?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, the Exalted One has said<br/> that ill<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> comes to pass through a cause.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of what?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who so spoke would be repeating the views of the Exalted One,<br/> and would not be misrepresenting him<br/> by what is not correct,<br/> but would be answering by a doctrine<br/> in conformity with his doctrine,<br/> and one whereby no one who is of his doctrine,<br/> a follower of his views,<br/> would render himself open to blame.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of those recluses and brahmins, friend,<br/> who believing in karma<br/> declare that ill has been wrought by one's own self,<br/> this ill was caused by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of those of them<br/> who declare that ill has been wrought by a different self,<br/> this ill too was caused by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of those of them<br/> who declare that ill has been wrought by both one's own self<br/> and by a different self,<br/> this ill too was caused by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case also of those<br/> who declare that ill has been wrought by neither,<br/> but has happened by chance,<br/> this ill too was caused by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[29]</b></span> In no one of these four views<br/> of those who believe in karma<br/> is it possible to show<br/> that those recluses and brahmins<br/> will experience feeling without contact."</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda was listening<br/> to Sāriputta's talk with the heretical Wanderers.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda,<br/> after going his alms-round in Rājagaha<br/> and eating his meal on his return,<br/> came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him,<br/> sat down at one side,<br/> and so seated told the Exalted One what that talk had been,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now the venerable Sāriputta clothed himself in the morning,<br/> and taking his bowl and cloak<br/> entered Rājagaha on his alms-round.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now he thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is too early as yet<br/> to go about Rājagaha for alms:<br/> I might go the gardens of the heretical Wanderers.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then those Wanderers spoke thus<br/> to the venerable Sāriputta so seated:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There are, friend Sāriputta,<br/> certain recluses and brahmins,<br/> believers in karma,<br/> who declare that ill is self-wrought;<br/> certain others of them<br/> declare ill is wrought by some one other [than one's self];<br/> certain others declare that ill is wrought by both,<br/> and certain others<br/> that ill is wrought by neither,<br/> but happens by chance.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friend, the Exalted One has said<br/> that ill comes to pass through a cause.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of what?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who so spoke would be repeating the views of the Exalted One,<br/> and would not be misrepresenting him<br/> by what is not correct,<br/> but would be answering by a doctrine<br/> in conformity with his doctrine,<br/> and one whereby no one who is of his doctrine,<br/> a follower of his views,<br/> would render himself open to blame.</p>

    <p class="f4">In no one of these four views<br/> of those who believe in karma<br/> is it possible to show<br/> that those recluses and brahmins<br/> will experience feeling without contact.'"</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well done, well done, Ānanda!</p>

    <p class="f4">Sāriputta so answering<br/> would be answering rightly.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have said that ill happens through a cause.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of what?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">So saying<br/> one would be a repeater of my sayings;<br/> he would not be misrepresenting me<br/> by what is not correct,<br/> and no one who is of my doctrine,<br/> a follower of my views,<br/> would thereby render himself open to blame.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of those recluses and brahmins, Ānanda,<br/> who believing in karma<br/> declare that ill has been wrought by one's own self,<br/> this ill was caused by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case also of those<br/> who declare that ill has been wrought by neither,<br/> but has happened by chance,<br/> this ill too was caused by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">In no one of these four cases<br/> is it possible to show<br/> that those recluses and brahmins<br/> who believe in karma<br/> will experience ill without contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">I too, Ānanda,<br/> was once staying here near Rājagaha<br/> in the Bamboo Grove<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, too, finding it too early to make my alms-round,<br/> bethought me to go to the gardens<br/> of the heretical Wanderers.</p>
