    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Upavāna<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him,<br/> sat down at one side,<br/> and so seated said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">Lord, there are certain recluses and brahmins,<br/> believers in karma,<br/> who declare that ill is self-wrought;<br/> certain others of them<br/> declare ill is wrought by some one other [than one's self];<br/> certain others declare that ill is wrought by both,<br/> and certain others<br/> that ill is wrought by neither,<br/> but happens by chance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Lord, what has the Exalted One to announce to us<br/> and how, if we were answering,<br/> should we be repeating his views correctly<br/> and would not be misrepresenting him<br/> by what is not correct,<br/> but would be answering by a doctrine<br/> in conformity with his doctrine,<br/> and one whereby no one who is of his doctrine,<br/> a follower of his views,<br/> would render himself open to blame?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have said Upavāna<br/> that ill comes to pass through a cause.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of what?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who so spoke would be repeating my views,<br/> and would not be misrepresenting me<br/> by what is not correct,<br/> but would be answering by a doctrine<br/> in conformity with my doctrine,<br/> and one whereby no one who is of my doctrine,<br/> a follower of my views,<br/> would render himself open to blame.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of those recluses and brahmins, Upavāna,<br/> who believing in karma<br/> declare that ill has been wrought by one's own self,<br/> this ill was caused by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of those of them<br/> who declare that ill has been wrought by a different self,<br/> this ill too was caused by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of those of them<br/> who declare that ill has been wrought by both one's own self<br/> and by a different self,<br/> this ill too was caused by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case also of those<br/> who declare that ill has been wrought by neither,<br/> but has happened by chance,<br/> this ill too was caused by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">In no one of these four views<br/> of those who believe in karma<br/> is it possible to show<br/> that those recluses and brahmins<br/> will experience feeling without contact."</p>
