    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[36]</b></span> "It is said, Sāriputta,<br/> in the Parāyana<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> in the Question of Ajita:</p>

    <p class="f4">Of that which is here concisely uttered, Sāriputta,<br/> how should the meaning be regarded in detail?"</p>

    <p class="f4">When he has thus said, Sāriputta was silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time the Exalted One addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Sutta No. (2) gives the name to this chapter.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> This is the last section in the <i>Sutta Nipāta.</i> The citation shows the historical priority of at least this portion of it to this portion of the <i>Kindred Sayings.</i> It is noteworthy that Buddhaghosa does not refer to the <i>Sutta-Nipāta,</i> nor even name the <i>Parāyana.</i> This may suggest that his readers would know it well enough. But in none of the 19 quotations from this work in the <i>Visuddhi-Magga</i> does he name either the work, or any section save certain Suttas in it. <i>Parāyana</i> may be roughly rendered 'The Quest.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> attributes this hesitation of the chief disciple not to the nature of the problem, but to the intention of the Master: - by which way is he wishing to teach through me? By <i>khandhas,</i> by elements, by external perception, by causal law? The Master gives the required hint: <i>bhūtaṁ,</i> become (<i>i.e.,</i> says B., 'born, produced, a name for the mental and bodily organism'). And Sāriputta follows up with the terms 'becoming' (<i>sambhavaṁ,</i> the prefix <i>sam</i> means for the <i>Comy.</i> continuity or increased intensity), <i>āhāra</i> (sustenance, i.e. cause), and the principle of causation.
