    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the brother Kaḷāra of the nobles<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> went into the presence of the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> and exchanging with him greetings<br/> and the compliments of friendship and courtesy,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Moliya-Phagguna,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> friend Sāriputta,<br/> has renounced the training<br/> and turned to lower things."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then that venerable brother<br/> will not have found comfort<br/> in this Norm and Discipline."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I gather that the venerable Sāriputta<br/> has found comfort<br/> in this Norm and Discipline."</p>

    <p class="f4">"<i>I</i> have no doubt about it, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But as to the future, friend?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am not worried about it, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Kaḷāra the noble rose from his seat,<br/> went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I know, lord, that the venerable Sāriputta<br/> has declared [he has won saving] knowledge,<br/> that birth is [for him] destroyed,<br/> that the divine life has been lived,<br/> that what was to do is done,<br/> that there is nothing further of these conditions."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed a certain brother:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come thou, brother, tell my word to Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Master, friend Sāriputta, is speaking to you.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/> responded that brother,<br/> and he went and told the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Master, friend Sāriputta, is speaking to you."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, friend,"<br/> responded Sāriputta,<br/> and he came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[39]</b></span> To him so seated the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is it true, Sāriputta, that you have declared<br/> [you have won saving] knowledge:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Birth is destroyed,<br/> the divine life lived,<br/> done that which was to do,<br/> and that there is for you<br/> nothing further of these conditions'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not in these words, lord,<br/> not in this form<br/> did I speak of the matter."</p>

    <p class="f4">"In whatever way, Sāriputta,<br/> a clansman declares [the winning of saving] knowledge,<br/> the declaration must be considered as such."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But did I not say, lord,<br/> that I did not speak of the matter<br/> in those words,<br/> in that form?"</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"If they were to ask you, Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How do you know, friend Sāriputta,<br/> how do you see<br/> that you have won saving knowledge:</p>

    <p class="f4">what would you answer?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Birth is destroyed,<br/> the divine life lived,<br/> that done what was to do,<br/> and that there is for you<br/> nothing further of these conditions?"'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus should I make answer:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is because, friend,<br/> in [the word] "destroyed"<br/> I have discerned<br/> that the basis of birth is destroyed -<br/> through this I know<br/> that saving knowledge is won:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Birth is destroyed,<br/> the divine life lived,<br/> that done what was to do,<br/> and that there is for you<br/> nothing further of these conditions?"'</p>

    <p class="f4">I should thus make answer:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Grasping, friend, is the base of becoming,<br/> grasping is whence it uprises,<br/> by grasping it is produced,<br/> grasping is its cause.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Pleasant,<br/> painful,<br/> neutral feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon, not long after the Exalted One had gone away,<br/> the venerable Sāriputta addressed the brethren:</p>
