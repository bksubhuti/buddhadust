    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This body, brethren, is not your own,<br/> neither is it that of any others.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It should be regarded<br/> as brought about by action of the past,<br/> by plans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> by volitions,<br/> by feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span> Now here, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> gives his mind thoroughly and systematically<br/> to the causal law, to wit,</p>

    <p class="f4">'This being,<br/> that comes to be;<br/> from the arising of this,<br/> that arises;<br/> this not being,<br/> that ceases;<br/> from the ceasing of this,<br/> that ceases.'</p>

    <p class="f4">To wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br/> conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/> conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/> conditioned by name-and-shape six-fold-sense,<br/> conditioned by six-fold-sense contact,<br/> conditioned by contact feeling,<br/> conditioned by feeling craving,<br/> conditioned by craving grasping,<br/> conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/> conditioned by becoming birth,<br/> conditioned by birth old age-and death,<br/> grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br/> from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/> from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/> from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of six-fold-sense;<br/> from ceasing of six-fold-sense ceasing of contact;<br/> from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/> from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/> from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/> from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/> from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/> from ceasing of birth,<br/> old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This is to be understood as the same doctrine set out in Nos. 17, 18. Your present <i>kāya</i> (body, person) is not an entity always self-identical, nor is it different from an entity other than any past 'you.' It is the outcome of the <i>kāyas</i> in the past series of your lives. The <i>Comy.</i> bears out this interpretation.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> But <i>Comy.:</i> <i>paccayehi kato.</i></p>
