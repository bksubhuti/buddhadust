    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which we will, brethren,<br/> and that which we intend to do<br/> and that wherewithal we are occupied: -<br/> this becomes an object<br/> for the persistence of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The object being there,<br/> there comes to be a station of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Consciousness being stationed<br/> and growing,<br/> there comes to pass descent of name-and-shape;<br/> because of name-and-shape, sense;<br/> because of sense, contact;<br/> because of contact, feeling;<br/> because of feeling, craving;<br/> because of craving, grasping;<br/> because of grasping, becoming;<br/> because of becoming, birth;<br/> because of birth,<br/> decay-and-death,<br/> grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> and despair<br/> come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Even if we do not will,<br/> or intend to do,<br/> and yet are occupied about something,<br/> this is an object<br/> for the persistence of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The object being there,<br/> there comes to be a station of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The object being there,<br/> there comes to be a station of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Consciousness being stationed<br/> and growing,<br/> there comes to pass descent of name-and-shape;<br/> because of name-and-shape, sense;<br/> because of sense, contact;<br/> because of contact, feeling;<br/> because of feeling, craving;<br/> because of craving, grasping;<br/> because of grasping, becoming;<br/> because of becoming, birth;<br/> because of birth,<br/> decay-and-death,<br/> grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> and despair<br/> come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But if we neither will,<br/> nor intend to do,<br/> nor are occupied about something,<br/> there is no becoming of an object<br/> for the persistence of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The object being absent,<br/> there comes to be no station of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Consciousness not being stationed<br/> nor growing,<br/> there comes to pass no descent of name-and-shape;<br/> because of the cessation of name-and-shape, the cessation of sense;<br/> because of the cessation of sense, the cessation of contact;<br/> because the cessation of contact, the cessation of feeling;<br/> because of the cessation of feeling, the cessation of craving;<br/> because of the cessation of craving, the cessation of grasping;<br/> because of the cessation of grasping, the cessation of becoming;<br/> because of the cessation of becoming, the cessation of birth;<br/> because of the cessation of birth,<br/> the cessation of decay-and-death,<br/> grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such ia the ceassation of this entire mass of ill."</p>
