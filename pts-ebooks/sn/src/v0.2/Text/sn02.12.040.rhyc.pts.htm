    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which we will, brethren,<br/> and that which we intend to do<br/> and that wherewithal we are occupied: -<br/> this becomes an object<br/> for the persistence of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The object being there,<br/> there comes to be a station of consciousness.</p>
