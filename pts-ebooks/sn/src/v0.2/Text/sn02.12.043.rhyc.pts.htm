    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, brethren,<br/> how ill arises<br/> and how it passes away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Listen to this,<br/> give your minds thoroughly,<br/> and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord",<br/> responded the brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">"What, brethren, is the arising of ill?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of sight and visible objects<br/> visual consciousness arises,<br/> contact is the clash of the three;<br/> feeling is conditioned by the contact,<br/> craving by the feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is the arising of ill.</p>
