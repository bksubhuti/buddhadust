    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at <i>Ñātika,</i><br/> in the Brick Hall.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One, meditating in solitude,<br/> gave utterance to that way<br/> of setting forth the Doctrine:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Because of sight and visible objects<br/> visual consciousness arises,<br/> contact is the clash of the three;<br/> feeling is conditioned by the contact,<br/> craving by the feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of sight and visible objects<br/> visual consciousness arises,<br/> contact is the clash of the three;<br/> feeling is conditioned by the contact,<br/> craving by the feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">And at that time a certain brother stood overhearing the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One saw him standing and overhearing,<br/> and seeing him,<br/> he spake thus unto him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Didst thou hear, brother,<br/> this our way of setting forth the Doctrine?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do thou learn this way, brother,<br/> do thou master it.</p>

    <p class="f4">It belongs to thy good, brother,<br/> this way of setting forth the Doctrine,<br/> it is of the rudiments of the divine life."</p>
