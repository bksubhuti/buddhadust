    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p><span class="f2">[75]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[51]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there a certain brahmin came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> and exchanged greetings with him,<br/> and in courteous and friendly converse<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What [say you] here, Master Gotama:</p>

    <p class="f4">He who does the deed, is he the one to experience?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span> "'He who does the deed and he who experiences are the same': -<br/> this, brahmin, is one extreme."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, then, Master Gotama, [what of this:] -<br/> he who does the deed is not the same as he who experiences?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"'He who does the deed is not the same as he who experiences': -<br/> this, brahmin, is the other extreme.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Tathāgata, not approaching either of these extremes, teaches you a Doctrine by a middle [way]:</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br/> conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/> conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/> conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br/> conditioned by sense contact,<br/> conditioned by contact feeling,<br/> conditioned by feeling craving,<br/> conditioned by craving grasping,<br/> conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/> conditioned by becoming birth,<br/> conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br/> from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/> from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/> from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br/> from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br/> from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/> from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/> from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/> from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/> from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/> from ceasing of birth,<br/> old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken, that brahmin said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wonderful, Master Gotama, wonderful!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/> that which had been thrown down,<br/> or were to reveal<br/> that which was hidden away,<br/> or were to point out the right road<br/> to him who had gone astray,<br/> or were to bring a lamp into the darkness,<br/> so that those who had eyes could see shapes, -<br/> even so, lord, has the lord Gotama shown me<br/> his doctrine in various ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, even I, lord, betake myself to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">May Master Gotama accept me as a follower,<br/> as one who from this day forth,<br/> as long as life lasts,<br/> has taken his refuge therein!"</p>
