    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The well taught Ariyan disciple, brethren,<br/> does not [wonder]:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How now?</p>

    <p class="f4">What being, what comes to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">From the arising of what, what arises?</p>

    <p class="f4">There being what,<br/> does name-and-shape come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There being what,<br/> does sense come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There being what,<br/> does contact come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There being what,<br/> does feeling come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There being what,<br/> does craving come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There being what,<br/> does grasping come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There being what,<br/> does becoming come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There being what,<br/> does birth come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There being what,<br/> does decay-and-death come to be?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Nay, brethren, the well taught Ariyan disciple has come to know,<br/> without depending upon another,<br/> that here:</p>

    <p class="f4">This being,<br/> that comes to be;<br/> from the arising of this,<br/> that arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">There being consciousness,<br/> name-and-shape comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">There being name-and-shape,<br/> sense comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">There being sense,<br/> contact comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">There being contact,<br/> feeling comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">There being feeling,<br/> craving comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">There being craving,<br/> grasping comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">There being grasping,<br/> becoming comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">There being becoming,<br/> birth comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">There being birth,<br/> decay-and-death comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is he knows that of such is the arising of the world.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Nor does the Ariyan disciple, brethren, [wonder]:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How now?</p>

    <p class="f4">There not being what,<br/> what does not come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">From the ceasing of what<br/> does what cease?</p>

    <p class="f4">There not being what,<br/> does name-and-shape not come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There not being what,<br/> does sense not come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There not being what,<br/> does contact not come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There not being what,<br/> does feeling not come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There not being what,<br/> does craving not come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">There not being what,<br/> does decay-and-death not come to be?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Nay, brethren, the well taught Ariyan disciple has come to know,<br/> without depending upon another,<br/> that here:</p>

    <p class="f4">This not being,<br/> that does not come to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">From the ceasing of this,<br/> that ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">That there not being consciousness,<br/> name-and-shape does not come to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That there not being name-and-shape,<br/> sense does not come to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That there not being sense,<br/> contact does not come to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That there not being contact,<br/> feeling does not come to be,</p>

    <p class="f4">That there not being feeling,<br/> craving does not come to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That there not being craving,<br/> grasping does not come to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That there not being grasping,<br/> becoming does not come to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That there not being becoming,<br/> birth does not come to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">That there not being becoming,<br/> decay-and-death does not come to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is he knows that thus this world ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when, brethren, the Ariyan disciple thus knows as it really is<br/> the coming to pass and the passing away of the world,<br/> he is what we call an Ariyan disciple who has won the view,<br/> he sees this Norm,<br/> his is the knowledge of the trained man,<br/> he has won to the stream of the Doctrine,<br/> he is Ariyan with the insight of revulsion;<br/> he stands knocking at the door of the Deathless."</p>
