    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In him, brethren, who contemplates<br/> the enjoyment that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> craving grows.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just as if there should be a blazing bonfire<br/> of ten<br/> or twenty<br/> or thirty<br/> or forty<br/> loads of faggots;<br/> thereon a man should throw from time to time<br/> dry grasses,<br/> should throw dry cow-dung,<br/> should throw dry faggots.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily such a great bonfire so fed,<br/> so supplied with fuel,<br/> would burn for a long while.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates<br/> the enjoyment that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> craving grows.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">In him, brethren, who contemplates the misery that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> craving ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just as if there should be a blazing bonfire<br/> of ten,<br/> or twenty,<br/> or thirty,<br/> or forty<br/> loads of faggots;<br/> thereon no man should<br/> from time to time<br/> throw dry grasses,<br/> dry cow-dung,<br/> dry sticks.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily that great bonfire,<br/> when the first laid fuel <span class="f2 g"><b>[60]</b></span> were come to an end,<br/> and it were not fed by other fuel,<br/> would without food<br/> become extinct.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates<br/> the misery that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> craving ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>
