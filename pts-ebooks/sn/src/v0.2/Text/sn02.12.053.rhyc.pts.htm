    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In him, brethren, who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br/> in all that makes for enfettering,<br/> craving grows.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just as if, brethren, because of oil<br/> and because of wick,<br/> an oil-lamp were to be burning,<br/> and in it<br/> from time to time<br/> a man were to pour oil<br/> and to adjust a wick.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily such an oil-lamp<br/> so fed,<br/> so supplied with fuel<br/> would burn for a long while.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br/> in all that makes for enfettering,<br/> craving grows.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">In him, brethren, who contemplates the misery that there is<br/> in all that makes for enfettering,<br/> craving ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just as if, because of oil<br/> and because of wick,<br/> an oil-lamp were to be burning,<br/> and in it no man should<br/> from time to time<br/> pour oil<br/> or adjust a wick.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily such an oil-lamp,<br/> when its first fuel were come to an end,<br/> and no other food were brought to it, would<br/> without food<br/> become extinct.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the misery that there is<br/> in all that makes for enfettering,<br/> craving ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>
