    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In him, brethren, who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> craving grows.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just as if there were a great tree,<br/> the roots whereof<br/> going downward and across<br/> bring upward all the juice.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, brethren, such a great tree<br/> so fed,<br/> so supplied with fuel<br/> would stand for a long while.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> craving grows.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">In him, brethren, who contemplates the misery that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> craving ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just as if there were a great tree,<br/> and a man were to come with axe and basket,<br/> and were to cut down that tree at the root.</p>

    <p class="f4">Cutting it by the root<br/> he were to dig a trench<br/> and were to pull out the roots<br/> even to the rootlets<br/> and root-fibres.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he were to cut the tree into logs,<br/> and were then to split <span class="f2 g"><b>[62]</b></span> the logs,<br/> and were then to make the logs into chips.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he were to dry the chips in wind and sun,<br/> then burn them by fire,<br/> then make an ashheap,<br/> then winnow the ashes in a strong wind,<br/> or let them be borne down<br/> by the swift stream of a river.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily that great tree<br/> thus cut down at the root<br/> would be made as a palm-tree stump,<br/> a no-thing,<br/> incapable of growing again in the future.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the misery that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> craving ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>
