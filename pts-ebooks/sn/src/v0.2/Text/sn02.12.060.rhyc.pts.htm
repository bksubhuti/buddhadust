    <p><span class="f2">[92]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying among the Kurus at Kammāsadamma,<br/> a township of the Kurus.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said thus to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wonderful, lord, marvellous, lord,<br/> is the depth of this causal law<br/> and how deep it appears.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And yet I reckon it as ever so plain."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Say not so, Ānanda,<br/> say not so!</p>

    <p class="f4">Deep indeed is this causal law,<br/> and deep indeed it appears.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is through not knowing,<br/> not understanding,<br/> not penetrating,<br/> that doctrine,<br/> that this generation has become entangled<br/> like a ball of string,<br/> and covered with blight,<br/> like unto munja grass and rushes,<br/> unable to overpass the doom of the Waste,<br/> the Woeful Way,<br/> the Downfall,<br/> the Constant Faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him, Ānanda, who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br/> in all <span class="f2 g"><b>[65]</b></span> that makes for grasping,<br/> there comes a descent of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Name-and-shape is conditioned by consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sense is conditioned by name-and-shape.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contact is conditioned by sense.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling is conditioned by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Craving is conditioned by feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just as if there were a great tree,<br/> the roots whereof<br/> going downward and across<br/> bring upward all the juice.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, Ānanda, such a great tree<br/> so fed,<br/> so supplied with fuel<br/> would stand for a long while.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> there comes a descent of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Name-and-shape is conditioned by consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sense is conditioned by name-and-shape.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contact is conditioned by sense.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling is conditioned by contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Craving is conditioned by feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">In him, Ānanda, who contemplates the misery that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> there comes no descent of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">When consciousness ceases, name-and-shape ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When name-and-shape ceases, sense ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When sense ceases, contact ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When contact ceases, feeling ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When feeling ceases, craving ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just as if there were a great tree,<br/> and a man were to come with axe and basket,<br/> and were to cut down that tree at the root.</p>

    <p class="f4">Cutting it by the root<br/> he were to dig a trench<br/> and were to pull out the roots<br/> even to the rootlets<br/> and root-fibres.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he were to cut the tree into logs,<br/> and were then to split the logs,<br/> and were then to make the logs into chips.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he were to dry the chips in wind and sun,<br/> then burn them by fire,<br/> then make an ashheap,<br/> then winnow the ashes in a strong wind,<br/> or let them be borne down<br/> by the swift stream of a river.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily that great tree<br/> thus cut down at the root<br/> would be made as a palm-tree stump,<br/> a no-thing,<br/> incapable of growing again in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the misery that there is<br/> in all that makes for grasping,<br/> there comes no descent of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">When consciousness ceases, name-and-shape ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When name-and-shape ceases, sense ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When sense ceases, contact ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When contact ceases, feeling ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When feeling ceases, craving ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">Grief,<br/> lamenting,<br/> suffering,<br/> sorrow,<br/> despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>
