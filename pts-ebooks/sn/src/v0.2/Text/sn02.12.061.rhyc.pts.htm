    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The untaught manyfolk, brethren,<br/> might well be repelled by this body,<br/> child of the four great elements,<br/> might cease to fancy it<br/> and wish to be free from it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Seen is the growth and decay of this body,<br/> child of the four great elements,<br/> the taking on<br/> and the laying down of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hence well might the manyfolk be repelled by it,<br/> cease to fancy it,<br/> and wish to be free from it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet this, brethren, that we call thought,<br/> that we call mind,<br/> that we call consciousness,<br/> by this the untaught manyfolk<br/> are not able to feel repelled,<br/> they are not able to cease fancying it<br/> or to be freed from it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day, brethren,<br/> has it been for the uneducated manyfolk<br/> that to which they cleave,<br/> that which they call 'mine,'<br/> that which they wrongly conceive thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is mine;<br/> this I am;<br/> this is my spirit.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Hence the untaught manyfolk<br/> are not able to feel repelled by it,<br/> are not able to cease fancying it,<br/> are not able to be freed from it.</p>

    <p class="f4">It were better, brethren,<br/> if the untaught manyfolk approached this body,<br/> child of the four great elements,<br/> as the self rather than the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Seen is it, brethren, how this body,<br/> child of the four great elements,<br/> persists for a year,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[66]</b></span> persists for two years,<br/> persists for three,<br/> four,<br/> five,<br/> ten,<br/> twenty,<br/> thirty years,<br/> persists for forty,<br/> for fifty years,<br/> persists for a hundred years<br/> and even longer.</p>

    <p class="f4">But this, brethren, that we call thought,<br/> that we call mind,<br/> that we call consciousness,<br/> that arises as one thing,<br/> ceases as another,<br/> whether by night or by day.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Just as a monkey, brethren,<br/> faring through the woods,<br/> through the great forest<br/> catches hold of a bough,<br/> letting it go<br/> seizes another,<br/> even so that which we call thought,<br/> that we call mind,<br/> that we call consciousness,<br/> that arises as one thing,<br/> ceases as another,<br/> both by night and by day.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the well taught Ariyan disciple<br/> gives his mind thoroughly and systematically<br/> to the causal law:</p>

    <p class="f4">This being,<br/> that comes to be;<br/> from the arising of this,<br/> that arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">This not being,<br/> that does not come to be;<br/> from the cessation of this,<br/> that ceases.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br/> conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/> conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/> conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br/> conditioned by sense contact,<br/> conditioned by contact feeling,<br/> conditioned by feeling craving,<br/> conditioned by craving grasping,<br/> conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/> conditioned by becoming birth,<br/> conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance ceasing of activities;<br/> from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/> from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/> from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br/> from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br/> from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/> from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/> from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/> from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/> from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/> from ceasing of birth,<br/> old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seeing thus, brethren,<br/> the well taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by bodily shape,<br/> is repelled by feeling<br/> and by perception<br/> and by activities<br/> and by consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled<br/> he is not attracted by them;<br/> unattracted he is set free,<br/> and the knowledge comes<br/> in freedom<br/> about freedom.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he knows that birth is perished,<br/> the divine life lived,<br/> done that which was to be done,<br/> no hereafter to these conditions!</p>
