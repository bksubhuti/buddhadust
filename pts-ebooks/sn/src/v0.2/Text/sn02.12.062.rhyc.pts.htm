    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The untaught manyfolk, brethren,<br/> might well be repelled by this body,<br/> child of the four great elements,<br/> might cease to fancy it<br/> and wish to be free from it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Seen is the growth and decay of this body,<br/> child of the four great elements,<br/> the taking on<br/> and the laying down of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hence well might the manyfolk be repelled by it,<br/> cease to fancy it,<br/> and wish to be free from it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet this, brethren, that we call thought,<br/> that we call mind,<br/> that we call consciousness,<br/> by this the untaught manyfolk are not able to feel repelled,<br/> they are not able to cease fancying it<br/> or to be freed from it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day, brethren,<br/> has it been for the uneducated manyfolk<br/> that to which they cleave,<br/> that which they call 'mine,'<br/> that which they wrongly conceive thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is mine; this I am; this is my spirit.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Hence the untaught manyfolk<br/> are not able to feel repelled by it,<br/> are not able to cease fancying it,<br/> are not able to be freed from it.</p>

    <p class="f4">It were better, brethren,<br/> if the untaught manyfolk approached this body,<br/> child of the four great elements,<br/> as the self rather than the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Seen is it, brethren, how this body,<br/> child of the four great elements,<br/> persists for a year,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[66]</b></span> persists for two years,<br/> persists for three,<br/> four,<br/> five,<br/> ten,<br/> twenty,<br/> thirty years,<br/> persists for forty,<br/> for fifty years,<br/> persists for a hundred years<br/> and even longer.</p>

    <p class="f4">But this, brethren, that we call thought,<br/> that we call mind,<br/> that we call consciousness,<br/> that arises as one thing,<br/> ceases as another,<br/> whether by night or by day.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of a contact which makes for pleasant feeling, brethren,<br/> pleasant feeling arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">From the ceasing of that contact which makes for pleasant feeling,<br/> the pleasant feeling, -<br/> which had arisen because of the contact making for pleasant feeling, -<br/> that ceases,<br/> that is quenched.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of a contact which makes for painful feeling, brethren,<br/> painful feeling arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">From the ceasing of that contact which makes for painful feeling,<br/> the painful feeling, -<br/> which had arisen because of the contact making for painful feeling, -<br/> that ceases,<br/> that is quenched.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of a contact which makes for neutral feeling, brethren,<br/> neutral feeling arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">From the ceasing of that contact which makes for neutral feeling,<br/> the neutral feeling, -<br/> which had arisen because of the contact making for neutral feeling, -<br/> that ceases,<br/> that is quenched.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if from the adjusted friction of two sticks,<br/> heat is born,<br/> a spark is brought forth,<br/> but from the separating<br/> and withdrawing<br/> of just those two sticks,<br/> the heat which was consequent,<br/> that ceases,<br/> that is quenched.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so because of a contact which makes for pleasant feeling, brethren,<br/> pleasant feeling arises,<br/> from the ceasing of that contact which makes for pleasant feeling,<br/> the pleasant feeling, -<br/> which had arisen because of the contact making for pleasant feeling, -<br/> that ceases,<br/> that is quenched;</p>

    <p class="f4">because of a contact which makes for painful feeling, brethren,<br/> painful feeling arises,<br/> From the ceasing of that contact which makes for painful feeling,<br/> the painful feeling, -<br/> which had arisen because of the contact making for painful feeling, -<br/> that ceases,<br/> that is quenched;</p>

    <p class="f4">because of a contact which makes for neutral feeling, brethren,<br/> neutral feeling arises,<br/> From the ceasing of that contact which makes for neutral feeling,<br/> the neutral feeling, -<br/> which had arisen because of the contact making for neutral feeling, -<br/> that ceases,<br/> that is quenched.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/> the well taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by contact,<br/> is repelled by feeling,<br/> is repelled by perception,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> is repelled by consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled<br/> he is not attracted by them,<br/> unattracted he is set free,<br/> and the knowledge comes in freedom<br/> about freedom!</p>

    <p class="f4">And he knows that birth is perished,<br/> that the divine life is lived,<br/> done that which was to be done,<br/> no hereafter to these conditions!</p>
