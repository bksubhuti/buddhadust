    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Each item in the text is dealt vith in full. See above §10. [Ed.: restored here]</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> So is Nālandi described, <i>Dialogues,</i> i, 277. In this beautiful Sutta that has the stamp of an <i>ipse dixit</i>, stress, for a special purpose, is laid in my Buddhism. p. 33, on the Teacher not being unique, but in a series. As a whole the Sutta lays stress on the antiquity of the moral instinct, the 'ought,' the Path-law in human nature shown by teachers.</p>

    <p class="lgqt">Here as in the <i>Mahā-Nidāna Suttanta</i> (<i>Dialogues,</i> ii, 51 f.) 'ignorance' and 'activities' are dropped. Why? asks the <i>Comy.</i> 'These belong to a third life.' ... This teaching is concerned with the present. These belong to the causes active in past lives. It is curious that no reference is made to the above-named Sutta, let alone to No. 10 above.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> reads not <i>yāvad-eva</i> but <i>yāva deva-.</i> Its paraphrase is 'to be known by many (<i>bahujana viññeyyaṅ</i>) so far as there is the division as to devas and men (<i>deva manussehi paricchedo atthi</i>) in the ten-thousandfold-universe (<i>cakkavāḷe</i>) ... well manifested <i>by the Tathāgata</i>' I do not think for a moment that the Sutta would have omitted <i>Tathāgatena,</i> had this been meant. The Suttas never do so. The success of the divine life is precisely in proportion as devas and men lead it and so manifest it.</p>
