    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying among the Kurus,<br/> at Kammasadamma,<br/> a township of the Kurus.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye handle, brethren, with an inward handling?"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span> When he had said this,<br/> a certain brother spake thus to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, Lord, handled with an inward handling."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now how, brother, do you handle<br/> with an inward handling?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then that brother answered,<br/> but thereby did not win over the heart of the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had thus said,<br/> the venerable Ānanda spake thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now is the time, Exalted One,<br/> now is the time, Blessed One,<br/> for the Exalted One to speak of the inward handling,<br/> when they have heard the Exalted One,<br/> the brethren will bear it in mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda,<br/> do ye listen,<br/> give your mind thoroughly<br/> and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/> responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In this religion, brethren,<br/> a brother handling<br/> handles the inward handling:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This various, manifold suffering<br/> that arises in the world<br/> which is decay-and-death: -<br/> this suffering<br/> what is its basis,<br/> what is its uprising,<br/> what is its source,<br/> what is its cause?</p>

    <p class="f4">What being does decay-and-death come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">What not being does decay-and-death not come to be?'</p>

    <p class="f4">He handling knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This various, manifold suffering<br/> that arises in the world<br/> which is decay-and-death: -<br/> this suffering has substance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> as its basis,<br/> has substance as its uprising,<br/> has substance as its source,<br/> has substance as its cause.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where there is substance,<br/> there decay-and-death comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where substance is not,<br/> decay-and-death comes not to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he knows decay-and-death,<br/> its uprising<br/> and its ceasing,<br/> and he knows the way that is meet<br/> for going to the ceasing of decay-and-death.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus practising he becomes one<br/> who walks according to the doctrine.</p>

    <p class="f4">Him, brethren, we call a brother who practises <span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span> rightly<br/> for the entire destruction of suffering,<br/> for the ceasing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Next, handling<br/> he handles the inward handling:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This substance<br/> what is its basis,<br/> what is its uprising,<br/> what is its source,<br/> what is its cause?</p>

    <p class="f4">What being does substance come to be?</p>

    <p class="f4">What not being does it not come to be?'</p>

    <p class="f4">He rightly handling knows thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Substance has craving as its basis,<br/> has craving as its uprising,<br/> has craving as its source,<br/> has craving as its cause.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where there is craving,<br/> there substance comes to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where craving is not,<br/> substance comes not to be.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And he knows substance,<br/> its uprising,<br/> and its ceasing,<br/> and he knows the way that is meet<br/> for going to the ceasing of substance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus practising<br/> he becomes one who walks according to the doctrine.</p>

    <p class="f4">Him, brethren, we call a brother who practises rightly<br/> for the entire right extinction of suffering,<br/> for the ceasing of substance.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Next, handling<br/> he handles the inward handling:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This craving<br/> what is its basis,<br/> what is its uprising,<br/> what is its source,<br/> what is its cause?</p>

    <p class="f4">This craving<br/> where when it arises<br/> does it arise?</p>

    <p class="f4">Where when it settles<br/> does it settle?'</p>

    <p class="f4">He in handling comes to know this: -</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whatever in the world seems lovely and pleasant,<br/> here when it arises<br/> doth craving arise,<br/> here when it settles<br/> doth craving settle.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what in the world<br/> seems lovely and pleasant?</p>

    <p class="f4">Sight in the world<br/> seems lovely and pleasant,<br/> here where it arises<br/> doth craving arise,<br/> here when it settles<br/> doth craving settle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing in the world<br/> seems lovely and pleasant,<br/> here where it arises<br/> doth craving arise,<br/> here when it settles<br/> doth craving settle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Smell in the world<br/> seems lovely and pleasant,<br/> here where it arises<br/> doth craving arise,<br/> here when it settles<br/> doth craving settle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Taste in the world<br/> seems lovely and pleasant,<br/> here where it arises<br/> doth craving arise,<br/> here when it settles<br/> doth craving settle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Touch in the world<br/> seems lovely and pleasant,<br/> here where it arises<br/> doth craving arise,<br/> here when it settles<br/> doth craving settle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Mind in the world<br/> seems lovely and pleasant,<br/> here where it arises<br/> doth craving arise,<br/> here when it settles<br/> doth craving settle.'</p>
