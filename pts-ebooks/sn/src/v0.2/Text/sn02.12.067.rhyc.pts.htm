    <p><span class="f2">[112]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[79]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta and the venerable Mahā-<span class="mozp">Koṭṭhita</span> were once staying at Benares,<br/> in Isipatana,<br/> in Antelope Wood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Maha-Koṭṭhita arose at eventide from meditation<br/> and came into the presence of the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">Exchanging friendly greetings with him<br/> and the compliments of courtesy,<br/> he sat down at one side.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> he said to the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/> old age-and-death,<br/> is it wrought in one and the same person,<br/> in a different person,<br/> in one who is both same and different,<br/> or in one who is neither the same nor a different person<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> -<br/> is it [a state] that arises by chance?"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[80]</b></span> "Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> is [the case with] old age-and-death;<br/> but old age-and-death is conditioned by birth."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/> is birth wrought in one and the same person,<br/> in a different person,<br/> in one who is both same and different,<br/> or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/> is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> is birth,<br/> but birth is conditioned by becoming."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/> is becoming wrought in one and the same person,<br/> in a different person,<br/> in one who is both same and different,<br/> or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/> is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> is becoming,<br/> but becoming is conditioned by grasping."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/> is grasping wrought in one and the same person,<br/> in a different person,<br/> in one who is both same and different,<br/> or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/> is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> is grasping,<br/> but grasping is conditioned by craving."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/> is craving wrought in one and the same person,<br/> in a different person,<br/> in one who is both same and different,<br/> or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/> is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> is craving,<br/> but craving is conditioned by feeling."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/> is feeling wrought in one and the same person,<br/> in a different person,<br/> in one who is both same and different,<br/> or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/> is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> is feeling,<br/> but feeling is conditioned by contact."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/> is contact wrought in one and the same person,<br/> in a different person,<br/> in one who is both same and different,<br/> or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/> is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> is contact,<br/> but contact is conditioned by sense."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/> is name-and-shape wrought in one and the same person,<br/> in a different person,<br/> in one who is both same and different,<br/> or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/> is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> is name-and-shape,<br/> but sense is conditioned by name-and-shape."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/> is name-and-shape wrought in one and the same person,<br/> in a different person,<br/> in one who is both same and different,<br/> or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/> is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> is name-and-shape,<br/> but name-and-shape is conditioned by consciousness."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/> is consciousness wrought in one and the same person,<br/> in a different person,<br/> in one who is both same and different,<br/> or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/> is it [a state] that has arisen by chance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> is consciousness,<br/> but consciousness is conditioned by name-and-shape."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lo! now we understand the venerable Sāriputta's words thus: -</p>

    <p class="f4">Neither name-and-shape,<br/> nor consciousness<br/> is any one of these four:<br/> wrought in one and the same person,<br/> wrought in a different person,<br/> wrought by one who is both,<br/> wrought by one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/> but arisen by chance;<br/> moreover name-and-shape<br/> is conditioned by consciousness,<br/> consciousness is conditioned by name-and-shape.</p>

    <p class="f4">How, friend Sāriputta,<br/> is the meaning of what you have said to be regarded?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, friend, I will make you a simile,<br/> for through a simile<br/> some intelligent men<br/> admit the meaning of what has been said.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just as if, friend,<br/> there stood two sheaves of reeds<br/> leaning one against the other.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, friend, name-and-shape<br/> comes to pass conditioned <span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span> by consciousness,<br/> consciousness conditioned by name-and-shape,<br/> sense conditioned by name-and-shape,<br/> contact is conditioned by sense,<br/> feeling is conditioned by contact,<br/> craving is conditioned by feeling,<br/> grasping is conditioned by craving,<br/> becoming is conditioned by grasping,<br/> birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even such is the uprising<br/> of this entire mass of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, friend, I were to pull towards me one of those sheaves of reeds,<br/> the other would fall;<br/> if I were to pull towards me the other,<br/> the former would fall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, friend, from the ceasing of name-and-shape,<br/> consciousness ceases;<br/> from the ceasing of consciousness,<br/> name-and-shape ceases;<br/> from the ceasing of name-and-shape<br/> sense ceases,<br/> from the ceasing of sense,<br/> contact ceases,<br/> from the ceasing of contact,<br/> craving ceases,<br/> from the ceasing of craving,<br/> feeling ceases,<br/> from the ceasing of feeling,<br/> grasping ceases,<br/> from the ceasing of grasping,<br/> becoming ceases,<br/> from the ceasing of becoming,<br/> birth ceases,<br/> even such is the ceasing,<br/> of this entire mass of ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wonderful, friend Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">Marvellous, friend Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">How well is this uttered by the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> and for this that has been uttered by him<br/> with these thirty-six bases we thank him."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The Maha-vedalla Sutta of the Majjhima (No. 43) is another dialogue between these two eminent Teachers. Both, I incline to think, were compiled rather as 'lessons' for learners than as genuine inquiries by Koṭṭhita. He would not have ranked as a leading Thera, had he needed instruction on any one of the points raised. <i>Cf.</i> the 'we' for 'I,' p. 80. See my <i>Buddhist Psychology</i> (Quest), p. 52 f.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Mrs. Rhys Davids here omits the rest where she has abridged it in SN 2.12.16 by: "In the same way you can so call a brother after this threefold manner if he teach, if he practise, if he be in consequence set free from any form of grasping with respect to birth, becoming, grasping, craving, feeling, contact, sense, name-and-shape, consciousness, activities, ignorance." It is included but similarly abridged in the PTS Pali.</p>
