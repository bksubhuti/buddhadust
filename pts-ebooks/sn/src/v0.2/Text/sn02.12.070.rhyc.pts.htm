    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[119]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[84]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Rājagaha<br/> in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the Exalted One was honoured,<br/> revered,<br/> beloved,<br/> ministered unto<br/> and reverently welcomed;<br/> and he was obtaining supplies of the requisites<br/> for clothing,<br/> sustenance,<br/> lodging<br/> and medicaments.</p>

    <p class="f4">This was also true<br/> of the Order of the brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the heretical Wanderers<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> were unhonoured,<br/> unrevered,<br/> not beloved<br/> nor ministered unto,<br/> not reverently welcomed<br/> nor obtaining supplies of the requisites<br/> for clothing,<br/> sustenance,<br/> lodging<br/> and medicaments.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time Susīma the Wanderer was dwelling at Rājagaha<br/> with a great company of Wanderers.</p>

    <p class="f4">And that company spake thus to Susīma the Wanderer:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come, friend Susīma,<br/> live you the divine life<br/> under the recluse Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">When you have learnt his Norm<br/> you will tell it to us.</p>

    <p class="f4">When we have learnt that Norm<br/> we will preach it to the laity.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus shall we become honoured,<br/> revered,<br/> beloved,<br/> ministered unto<br/> and reverently welcomed,<br/> and we shall obtain supplies of the requisites<br/> for clothing,<br/> sustenance,<br/> lodging<br/> and medicaments."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, friends!"<br/> responded Susīma the Wanderer<br/> to his <span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span> company,<br/> and he went into the presence of the venerable Ānanda,<br/> greeted him<br/> and exchanged the compliments of courtesy and friendship<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Susīma the Wanderer spake thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I desire, friend Ānanda,<br/> to live the divine life<br/> under this Norm and Discipline."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda took Susīma the Wanderer<br/> into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/> the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, this is Susīma the Wanderer.</p>

    <p class="f4">He has said thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I desire, friend Ānanda,<br/> to live the divine life<br/> under this Norm and Discipline.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda,<br/> ordain<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Susīma."</p>

    <p class="f4">So Susīma the Wanderer obtained admission and ordination<br/> in the Order of the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time<br/> many brethren in the Order declared Aññā<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> [with the confession]:</p>

    <p class="f4">"We know that perished is birth,<br/> lived is the divine life,<br/> done is what was to be done,<br/> there is nothing further in these conditions."</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Susīma heard<br/> that many brethren in the Order had declared Aññā,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"We know that perished is birth,<br/> lived is the divine life,<br/> done is what was to be done,<br/> there is nothing further in these conditions."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Susīma went to those brethren<br/> and greeting them,<br/> and exchanging the compliments of courtesy and friendship,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he spake thus to those brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is it true what they say<br/> that the venerable ones have declared Aññā under the Exalted One,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'We know that perished is birth,<br/> lived is the divine life,<br/> done is what was to be done,<br/> there is nothing further in these conditions?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[86]</b></span> "Then surely you venerable ones,<br/> thus knowing,<br/> thus seeing,<br/> enjoy manifold mystic power:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Being one ye become many,<br/> being many ye become one;<br/> here visible<br/> there invisible<br/> ye go without let or hindrance through wall,<br/> through rampart,<br/> through hill,<br/> as if through air;<br/> ye dive into earth<br/> and up again<br/> as if in water;<br/> ye walk on water<br/> without cleaving it<br/> as on earth;<br/> ye travel seated cross-legged through air<br/> as if ye were birds on the wing;<br/> ye can handle and stroke with the hand<br/> this moon and sun,<br/> mighty and powerful though they be;<br/> ye can control the body<br/> even to Brahma world?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely you venerable ones<br/> thus knowing,<br/> thus seeing,<br/> with purified hearing of devas<br/> passing that of men,<br/> can hear sounds both of devas and of men<br/> whether far or near?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely you venerable ones<br/> thus knowing,<br/> thus seeing,<br/> know in mind the mind of other beings,<br/> other persons,<br/> ye know the passionate heart as passionate,<br/> the dispassionate heart as dispassionate,<br/> ye know the heart of hate as hating,<br/> the heart of amity as amiable;<br/> ye know the dull heart as dull,<br/> the intelligent heart as intelligent;<br/> ye know the confused mind as confused,<br/> the intent mind as tense,<br/> the lofty mind as such,<br/> the mean mind as mean,<br/> the far-seeing mind as far-seeing mind,<br/> the cramped vision as cramped vision,<br/> the concentrated mind as concentrated mind,<br/> the desultory mind as desultory mind,<br/> the freed mind as freed,<br/> the bound mind as bound?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely you venerable ones<br/> thus knowing,<br/> thus seeing,<br/> can remember your divers former lives,<br/> that is to say,<br/> one birth,<br/> or two,<br/> or three,<br/> or four,<br/> or five births,<br/> or ten,<br/> twenty,<br/> thirty,<br/> forty,<br/> fifty births,<br/> or a hundred,<br/> a thousand<br/> or even a hundred thousand,<br/> or even more than one aeon of involution<br/> or more than one aeon of evolution,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> or more than one of both involution and evolution:<br/> 'Such an one was I by name,<br/> of such a clan,<br/> of such a social status,<br/> so was I nourished,<br/> such <span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span> happy and painful experiences were mine,<br/> so did the span of life end,<br/> deceasing thence<br/> so did I come to be,<br/> there too was I such by name,<br/> of such a clan,<br/> of such a social station,<br/> so was I nourished,<br/> such happy and painful experiences were mine,<br/> so did the span of life end,<br/> deceasing thence<br/> so did I come to be here':<br/> ye can thus call to mind<br/> in circumstance<br/> and detail<br/> your former lives?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely you venerable ones<br/> thus knowing,<br/> thus seeing,<br/> can behold with purified deva-vision<br/> past that of man,<br/> beings as they decease<br/> and come to be<br/> mean or excellent,<br/> fair or foul,<br/> ye can know them going<br/> according to their deeds<br/> to weal or woe,<br/> thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lo! these good people<br/> whose deeds were evil,<br/> whose speech was evil,<br/> whose thoughts were evil,<br/> abusers of Ariyans,<br/> having wrong views<br/> and undertaking the acts that [come from] wrong views -<br/> they at the breaking up of the body,<br/> after death<br/> have come to be<br/> in the Waste,<br/> the Woeful Way,<br/> the Downfall,<br/> hell.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lo! those good people<br/> whose deeds were good,<br/> whose speech was good,<br/> whose thoughts were good,<br/> who abused not Ariyans,<br/> of right views<br/> and who undertook the acts that [come from] right views -<br/> they at the breaking up of the body,<br/> after death<br/> have come to be in a good destiny,<br/> in a bright world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus do ye behold beings<br/> with pure deva-sight<br/> passing that of men,<br/> how they decease,<br/> and come to be<br/> mean or excellent,<br/> fair or foul,<br/> ye know them<br/> as going according to their actions<br/> to weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely you venerable ones<br/> thus knowing,<br/> thus seeing,<br/> are able to dwell in volitional contact<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> with those states of deliverance<br/> where the Rūpa [world] is transcended<br/> and the Immaterial [world is reached]?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now here, venerable ones,<br/> is both your replying<br/> and your non-attainment of these things?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is none, friend.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span> We have been freed by insight,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> friend Susīma.</p>

    <p class="f4">I do not know fully<br/> the matter stated concisely by the venerable ones.</p>

    <p class="f4">It would be well if the venerable ones<br/> were to state it so that I might come to know fully<br/> the matter they have stated concisely."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whether you know it, friend Susīma,<br/> or whether you do not know it,<br/> we have been freed by insight."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Susīma rising from his seat<br/> went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the venerable Susīma so far as he had conversed with those brethren<br/> told all to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">"First, Susīma, [comes] knowledge of the law of cause [and effect],<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> afterwards [comes] knowledge about Nibbāna."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do not know fully<br/> this matter stated concisely by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">It would be well, lord,<br/> if the Exalted One were to state it<br/> so that I might come to know fully<br/> the matter he has stated concisely."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whether you come to know it, Susīma,<br/> or whether you do not,<br/> first comes knowledge of the law of cause [and effect],<br/> afterwards comes knowledge about <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, Susīma?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the body<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent, is it painful or pleasant?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Painful, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/> painful,<br/> changeable by nature,<br/> do we well to contemplate it as:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is mine,<br/> I am it,<br/> it is my spirit'?"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span> "Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"And is not the same true of feeling,</p>

    <p class="f4">of perception,</p>

    <p class="f4">of activities,</p>

    <p class="f4">of consciousness?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wherefore, Susīma, whatsoever body,<br/> past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> internal or external,<br/> coarse or fine,<br/> mean or lofty,<br/> far or near -<br/> of all body to say it is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my spirit: -<br/> so is this to be regarded by right insight<br/> as it really is.</p>

    <p class="f4">And so too are feeling,</p>

    <p class="f4">perception,</p>

    <p class="f4">activities,</p>

    <p class="f4">consciousness to be regarded.</p>

    <p class="f4">So beholding, Susīma,<br/> the well taught Ariyan disciple feels repulsion at body,<br/> feeling,<br/> perception,<br/> activities,<br/> consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling repulsion he is not attracted by them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Unattracted he is set free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Knowledge comes to him freed as to being freed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> and he knows that birth is perished,<br/> that the divine life is lived,<br/> done is what was to be done;<br/> there is nothing further of these conditions.</p>

    <p class="f4">Old age and dying are conditioned by birth:</p>

    <p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Birth is conditioned by becoming:</p>

    <p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Becoming is conditioned by grasping:</p>

    <p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Grasping is conditioned by craving . . .</p>

    <p class="f4">craving by feeling . . .</p>

    <p class="f4">feeling by contact . . .</p>

    <p class="f4">contact by sense . . .</p>

    <p class="f4">sense by name-and-shape . . .</p>

    <p class="f4">name-and-shape by consciousness . . .</p>

    <p class="f4">consciousness by activities . . .</p>

    <p class="f4">activities by ignorance:</p>

    <p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"When birth ceases, old age-and-death ceases:</p>

    <p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"When becoming ceases, birth ceases:</p>

    <p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[90]</b></span> "When grasping ceases becoming ceases;<br/> when craving ceases, grasping ceases;<br/> when feeling ceases, craving ceases;<br/> when contact ceases, feeling ceases;<br/> when sense ceases, contact ceases;<br/> when name-and-shape ceases, sense ceases;<br/> when consciousness ceases, name-and-shape ceases;<br/> when activities cease, consciousness ceases;<br/> when ignorance ceases, activities cease:</p>

    <p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely, thou, Susīma, thus knowing, thus seeing, dost enjoy divers mystic powers:</p>

    <p class="f4">being one thou canst become many;<br/> being many thou canst become one;<br/> thou goest here visible<br/> there invisible<br/> without let or hindrance<br/> through wall,<br/> through rampart,<br/> through hill<br/> as if through air;<br/> thou divest into earth<br/> and up again<br/> as if in water;<br/> thou walkest on water<br/> without cleaving it as if on earth;<br/> thou travellest seated cross-legged through air<br/> as if thou were a bird on the wing;<br/> thou canst handle and stroke with the hand<br/> this moon and sun,<br/> mighty and powerful though they be,<br/> yea, even to Brahmaworld canst thou dispose of thyself<br/> in the body?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely, Susīma, thus knowing thus seeing,<br/> thou canst hear,<br/> with pure deva-hearing passing that of men,<br/> sounds divine and human,<br/> be they remote or near?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely, Susīma, thus knowing thus seeing,<br/> thou canst understand with thy mind<br/> the mind of other beings,<br/> other persons,<br/> so that thou knowest the character of their thought?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely, Susīma, thus knowing thus seeing,<br/> thou canst remember divers former lives,<br/> even one birth or many,<br/> in circumstance and detail?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely, Susīma, thus knowing thus seeing,<br/> with pure deva-vision passing that of men<br/> thou canst behold beings as they go according to their deeds,<br/> deceasing,<br/> re-arising?" <span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then surely, Susīma, thus knowing thus seeing,<br/> thou attaining by volition<br/> canst dwell in those stages of deliverance<br/> where the Rüpa-world is transcended<br/> and the Immaterial [world is reached]?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Here then, Susīma:</p>

    <p class="f4">This catechism and the non-attainment of these things:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> —<br/> this is what we have done."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Susīma<br/> falling prone at the feet of the Exalted One<br/> spake thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Transgression, lord, hath caused me,<br/> so foolish,<br/> so stupid,<br/> so wrong am I,<br/> to transgress.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have gained admission<br/> as a thief of the Norm<br/> into this Norm and Discipline<br/> so well set forth.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Exalted One, lord,<br/> accept this my confession<br/> for my restraining myself in future."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Verily, Susīma, transgression hath caused thee,<br/> so foolish,<br/> so stupid,<br/> so wrong art thou,<br/> to transgress,<br/> who didst gain admission<br/> as a thief of the Norm<br/> into this Norm and Discipline<br/> so well set forth.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is as if, Susīma,<br/> they had caught a robber,<br/> an evildoer,<br/> and showed him to the prince saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sire, this is a robber, an evildoer.</p>

    <p class="f4">Inflict on him what penalty you wish.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the prince were to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Go, men, bind this man's arms behind him with a strong rope,<br/> shave him bald,<br/> lead him around in a tumbril<br/> with a tam-tam<br/> from street to street,<br/> from crossroads to crossroads,<br/> and take him out by the south gate<br/> and at the south of the city<br/> cut off his head.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the princes' men were to do even as they were told.</p>

    <p class="f4">What think you, Susīma?</p>

    <p class="f4">Would not that man in consequence<br/> experience woe and sorrow?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whether he experienced woe and sorrow or not,<br/> would not the gaining admission<br/> as a thief of doctrine<br/> into a Norm and <span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span> Discipline so well set forth<br/> have still more woeful<br/> and still bitterer results,<br/> yea, conduce to downfall hereafter?</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as thou, Susīma, hast seen thy transgression as transgression<br/> and hast made confession as is right,<br/> we do accept this from thee.</p>

    <p class="f4">For this, Susīma, it is to grow in the Ariyan discipline,<br/> when having seen our transgression as transgression<br/> we make confession as is right<br/> and in future practise self-restraint."</p>
