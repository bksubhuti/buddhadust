    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvathi at the Jeta's Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One took up<br/> a little pinch of dust<br/> on the tip of his finger-nail<br/> and said to the brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'What think ye, brethren?<br/> Whether is this pinch of dust<br/> that I have taken up on my finger-nail<br/> the greater,<br/> or the mighty earth?'</p>

    <p class="f4">The latter, lord, the mighty earth is the greater.<br/> Infinitely small is this pinch of dust<br/> taken up by the Exalted One on his finger-nail,<br/> not by a hundredth part,<br/> nor by a thousandth part,<br/> not by a hundred thousandth part<br/> does it equal the mighty earth<br/> when set beside it<br/> — this pinch of dust<br/> taken up by the Exalted One<br/> on his finger-nail.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren,<br/> for the Ariyan disciple who has won vision,<br/> for the person who has understanding<br/> this is the greater ill, to wit,<br/> that which for him is wholly perished,<br/> wholly finished;<br/> little is the ill that remains,<br/> not worth the hundredth part,<br/> not worth the thousandth part,<br/> not worth the hundred thousandth part<br/> when measured with the former ill<br/> which for him is wholly perished,<br/> wholly finished,<br/> to wit, a term of seven times.<sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

    <p class="f4">So great in good, brethren,<br/> is it to be wise in the Norm;<br/> so great in good is it<br/> to have gained the eye of the Norm.</p>
