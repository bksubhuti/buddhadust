    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren, there were a bathing-tank<br/> fifty yojanas in length,<br/> fifty yojanas in breadth,<br/> fifty yojanas in depth<br/> full of water<br/> brimming over so that a crow might drink;<br/> and therefrom a man were to draw water<br/> on the tip of a grass-blade.</p>

    <p class="f4">What think ye, brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">Which is the greater:<br/> the water brought up by the tip of the grass-blade,<br/> or the water of the bathing-tank?</p>

    <p class="f4">Just this, lord, is the greater,<br/> the water of the bathing-tank.</p>

    <p class="f4">Scant is the water brought up by the tip of the grass-blade,<br/> not a hundredth part does it equal,<br/> not a thousandth part does it equal,<br/> not a hundred thousandth part<br/> does the water brought up by the tip of the grass-blade<br/> equal the measure of the water of the tank.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren,<br/> for the Ariyan disciple who has won vision,<br/> for the person who has understanding<br/> this is the greater ill, to wit,<br/> that which for him is wholly perished,<br/> wholly finished;<br/> little is the ill that remains,<br/> not worth the hundredth part,<br/> not worth the thousandth part,<br/> not worth the hundred thousandth part<br/> when measured with the former ill<br/> which for him is wholly perished,<br/> wholly finished,<br/> to wit, a term of seven times.</p>

    <p class="f4">So great in good, brethren,<br/> is it to be wise in the Norm;<br/> so great in good is it<br/> to have gained the eye of the Norm.</p>
