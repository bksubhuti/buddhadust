    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren, that where those great rivers flow together,<br/> meet together, to wit,<br/> Gangā,<br/> Yamunā,<br/> Aciravatī,<br/> Sarabhū,<br/> Mahī,<br/> the water should die away and come to an end, excepting two or three drops.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">Which is the greater:<br/> the water that, having flowed together,<br/> has died away and come to an end,<br/> or those two or three drops remaining over?</p>

    <p class="f4">Just that, lord, is greater,<br/> even the water that having flowed together<br/> has died away and come to an end;<br/> scant are the two or three drops remaining over,<br/> not a hundredth part do they equal,<br/> not a thousandth,<br/> not a hundred thousandth part do they equal<br/> when compared with the water<br/> that having flowed together<br/> has died away and come to an end,<br/> those two or three drops of water.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren,<br/> for the Ariyan disciple who has won vision,<br/> for the person who has understanding<br/> this is the greater ill, to wit,<br/> that which for him is wholly perished,<br/> wholly finished;<br/> little is the ill that remains,<br/> not worth the hundredth part,<br/> not worth the thousandth part,<br/> not worth the hundred thousandth part<br/> when measured with the former ill<br/> which for him is wholly perished,<br/> wholly finished,<br/> to wit, a term of seven times.</p>

    <p class="f4">So great in good, brethren,<br/> is it to be wise in the Norm;<br/> so great in good is it<br/> to have gained the eye of the Norm.</p>
