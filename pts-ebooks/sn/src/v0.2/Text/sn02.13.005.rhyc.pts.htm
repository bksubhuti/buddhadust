    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren, that a man were to lay together on the earth<br/> seven little balls of clay<br/> [as big as] jujube kernels.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren,<br/> which is more?</p>

    <p class="f4">The seven little jujube-kernel clay balls laid together,<br/> or the earth?</p>

    <p class="f4">Just this, lord, is more,<br/> the earth itself;<br/> scant are the seven little jujube-kernel clay balls<br/> laid together.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not make up one hundredth part,<br/> nor one thousandth,<br/> nor one hundred thousandth part<br/> when compared with the earth -<br/> those seven little clay balls.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren,<br/> for the Ariyan disciple who has won vision,<br/> for the person who has understanding<br/> this is the greater ill, to wit,<br/> that which for him is wholly perished,<br/> wholly finished;<br/> little is the ill that remains,<br/> not worth the hundredth part,<br/> not worth the thousandth part,<br/> not worth the hundred thousandth part<br/> when measured with the former ill<br/> which for him is wholly perished,<br/> wholly finished,<br/> to wit, a term of seven times.</p>

    <p class="f4">So great in good, brethren,<br/> is it to be wise in the Norm;<br/> so great in good is it<br/> to have gained the eye of the Norm.</p>
