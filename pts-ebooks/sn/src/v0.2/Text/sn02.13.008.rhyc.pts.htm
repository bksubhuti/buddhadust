    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren, that the sea were to come to extinction, to an end except for two or three drops of water brought from it.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren, which is more?</p>

    <p class="f4">The water in the sea or the two or three surviving drops of water?</p>

    <p class="f4">Just that is more, lord,<br/> even the water in the sea that has come to extinction,<br/> to an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">Scanty are the two or three surviving drops.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not make up one hundredth,<br/> one thousandth,<br/> one hundred thousandth part<br/> when compared with the sea that has come to extinction,<br/> to an end -<br/> those two or three drops.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren,<br/> for the Ariyan disciple who has won vision,<br/> for the person who has understanding<br/> this is the greater ill, to wit,<br/> that which for him is wholly perished,<br/> wholly finished;<br/> little is the ill that remains,<br/> not worth the hundredth part,<br/> not worth the thousandth part,<br/> not worth the hundred thousandth part<br/> when measured with the former ill<br/> which for him is wholly perished,<br/> wholly finished,<br/> to wit, a term of seven times.</p>

    <p class="f4">So great in good, brethren,<br/> is it to be wise in the Norm;<br/> so great in good is it<br/> to have gained the eye of the Norm.</p>
