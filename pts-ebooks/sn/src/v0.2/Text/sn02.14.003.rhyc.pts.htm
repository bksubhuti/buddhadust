    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard. On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta's Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of the diversity in elements, brethren, arises diversity of contact; diversity in elements does not arise because of diversity of contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">What, brethren, is the diversity in elements?</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye-element<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span>,<br/> the ear-element,<br/> the nose-element,<br/> the tongue-elements,<br/> the body-elements,<br/> the mind-elements.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called the diversity in elements.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is the consequent diversity of contact?</p>

    <p class="f4">An eye-contact arises because of the eye-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">An ear-contact arises because of the ear-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">A nose-contact arises because of the nose-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">A tongue-contact arises because of the tongue-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">A body-contact arises because of the body-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">A mind-contact arises because of the mind-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is thus, brethren, that because of diversity of elements diversity of contact arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">And now the order of happening has been told you.</p>
