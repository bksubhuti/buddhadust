    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard. On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta's Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of the diversity in elements, brethren, arises diversity of contact; because of the diversity of contact arises diversity of feeling.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What, brethren, is the diversity in elements?</p>

    <p class="f4">The elements of eye,<br/> of visible object,<br/> of eye-awareness;</p>

    <p class="f4">the elements of ear,<br/> of sound,<br/> of ear-awareness;</p>

    <p class="f4">the elements of nose,<br/> of odour,<br/> of nose-awareness;</p>

    <p class="f4">the elements of tongue,<br/> of taste,<br/> of tongue-awareness;</p>

    <p class="f4">the elements of body,<br/> of tangibles,<br/> of body-awareness;</p>

    <p class="f4">the elements of mind,<br/> of ideas,<br/> of mind-awareness:</p>

    <p class="f4">this, brethren, is called the diversity in elements.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is the consequent diversity of contact?</p>

    <p class="f4">An eye-contact arises because of the eye-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">An ear-contact arises because of the ear-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">A nose-contact arises because of the nose-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">A tongue-contact arises because of the tongue-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">A body-contact arises because of the body-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">A mind-contact arises because of the mind-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is thus, brethren, that because of diversity of elements diversity of contact arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">How is it that because of diversity in element there arises diversity of contact? that because of diversity of contact there arises diversity of feeling?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of eye-element, brethren, arises eye-contact; because of eye-contact arises feeling produced by eye-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of ear-element, arises ear-contact; because of ear-contact arises feeling produced by ear-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of nose-element, arises nose-contact; because of nose-contact arises feeling produced by nose-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of tongue-element, arises tongue-contact; because of tongue-contact arises feeling produced by tongue-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of body-element, arises body-contact; because of body-contact arises feeling produced by body-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of mind-element, arises mind-contact; because of mind-contact arises feeling produced by mind-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is that because of diversity in element there arises diversity of contact, because of diversity of contact there arises diversity of feeling.</p>
