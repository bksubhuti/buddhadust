    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta's Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Brethren.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these seven elements, brethren — which seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The radiance-element,<br/> the beauty-element,<br/> the space-infinity-element,<br/> the consciousness-infinity-element,<br/> the nothingness-sphere-element,<br/> the neither perception-nor-non-perception-sphere-element,<br/> the perception-and-feeling-cessation-element<br/> — these are the seven.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When he had so said, a certain brother said this to him: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Because of what, lord, are these seven elements revealed?'</p>

    <p class="f4">That radiance-element, brother, is revealed through darkness.<br/> That beauty-element is revealed through ugliness.<br/> That space-infinity-element is revealed through visible object.<br/> That consciousness-infinity-element is revealed through space-infinity-element.<br/> And similarly each of the remaining three is revealed through the element named previously.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, lord, can there be attainment of each of these seven elements?</p>

    <p class="f4">The radiance, beauty, space-infinity, consciousness-infinity-sphere and nothingness-sphere-elements are to be won by attainment in perception.<br/> The neither-perception-nor-non-perception-sphere-element is to be won by attainment in the remaining activities of mind.<br/> The perception and feeling cessation-element is to be won by attainment of cessation.</p>
