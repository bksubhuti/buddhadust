    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">With causal basis,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> brethren,<br/> arises thought of sense-desires,<br/> not without causal basis.</p>

    <p class="f4">With a causal basis arises cruelty,<br/> not without causal basis.</p>

    <p class="f4">How do they so arise?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of the element of sense-desire<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> arises sensuous perception,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[106]</b></span> because of sensuous perception<br/> arise sensuous aims,<br/> because of sensuous aims<br/> arises sensuous desire,<br/> because of sensuous desire<br/> arises sensuous yearning,<br/> because of sensuous yearning<br/> arises sensuous questing.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is as if a man were to throw down<br/> a blazing grass-torch<br/> in dry grass-jungle.</p>

    <p class="f4">With causal basis, brethren,<br/> arises thought of renunciation,<br/> not without causal basis.</p>

    <p class="f4">With causal basis<br/> arises thought of benevolence,<br/> not without causal basis.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Kāma</i> means literally desire, but with sense-experience as its constant context. Unlike <i>chando,</i> translated 'desire' just below, it has no conational emphasis. It bears, in Buddhist doctrine, almost the sense of 'carnal' in Christian homiletics. It is a name for all life from the lowest up to and inclusive of the nearer, <i>i.e.,</i> more akin-to-earth deva-spheres. For here too is 'incarnate' life and carnal desire. The difficulty of translating it is obvious. See <i>Ency. Religion and Ethics,</i> 'Desire'; <i>Compendium,</i> 81, n. 2; <i>Bud. Psych. Ethics,</i> p. 334. The antithetical term, 'renunciation': - <i>nekkhamma</i> - is not from the same root but from <i>kram,</i> going forth. The other two antithetical terms - benevolence, kindness - are negative in form, lit. non-enmity, harmlessness, but are not necessarily so in meaning. <i>E.g.,</i> the latter, in the Sutta-Nipāta <i>Comy.,</i> is paraphrased as <i>sa-karuṇabhāvo,</i> state of feeling pity, and pity is actively conceived by Buddhaghosa, <i>Vis. Mag.,</i> p. 314 <i>f.,e.g.,</i> 'the not being able to endure the sufferings of others.'</p>
