    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Rājagaha<br/> on the hill Vulture's Peak.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta<br/> with many brethren<br/> was walking to and fro<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/> with many brethren<br/> was walking to and fro<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā-Kassapa<br/> with many brethren<br/> was walking to and fro<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Anuruddha<br/> with many brethren<br/> was walking to and fro<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Puṇṇa Mantānī's son<br/> with many brethren<br/> was walking to and fro<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Upāli<br/> with many brethren<br/> was walking to and fro<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda<br/> with many brethren<br/> was walking to and fro<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Devadatta<br/> with many brethren<br/> was walking to and fro<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye see Sāriputta, brethren,<br/> walking to and fro with many brethren?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"All of those brethren are of great wisdom."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye see Moggallāna, brethren,<br/> so walking to and fro with many brethren?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"All of those brethren are of great will-potency."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye see Kassapa, brethren,<br/> so walking to and fro with many brethren?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"All of those brethren keep the stricter observances."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye see Anuruddha, brethren,<br/> so walking to and fro with many brethren?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"All of those brethren have the deva-sight."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye see Puṇṇa Mantānī's son, brethren,<br/> so walking to and fro with many brethren?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"All of those brethren are of righteous converse."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye see Upāli, brethren,<br/> so walking to and fro with many brethren?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"All of those brethren know the Vinaya by heart."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye see Ānanda, brethren,<br/> so walking to and fro with many brethren?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye see Devadatta, brethren,<br/> so walking to and fro with many brethren?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"All of those brethren have evil wants.</p>

    <p class="f4">Through an element it is, brethren,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">They of virtuous tastes<br/> flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of virtuous tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the past, brethren, through an element it was,<br/> that beings flowed together,<br/> met together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> flowed together,<br/> met together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of virtuous tastes<br/> flowed together,<br/> met together<br/> with them of virtuous tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the future, brethren, through an element it will be,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> will flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of virtuous tastes<br/> will flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of virtuous tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the present, brethren, through an element it is,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>
