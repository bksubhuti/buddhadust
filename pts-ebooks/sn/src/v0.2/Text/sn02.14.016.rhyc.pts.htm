    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Through an element it is, brethren,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the past, brethren, through an element it was,<br/> that beings flowed together,<br/> met together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> flowed together,<br/> met together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the future, brethren, through an element it will be,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> will flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the present, brethren, through an element it is,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just, brethren, as muck flows together,<br/> meets together with muck,<br/> urine with urine,<br/> pus with pus,<br/> blood with blood,<br/> through an element it is, brethren,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the past, brethren, through an element it was,<br/> that beings flowed together,<br/> met together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> flowed together,<br/> met together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the future, brethren, through an element it will be,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> will flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the present, brethren, through an element it is,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br/> flow together,<br/> meet together<br/> with them of low tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">This said the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Well-farer so saying,<br/> the Master said this yet further:-</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Lust's jungle, of association born,<br/> By not associating is cut down.<br/> As one who, mounted on a puny plank,<br/> Is in mid-ocean whelmed beneath the waves,<br/> So even he of blameless life doth sink<br/> When thrown together with the man of sloth.<br/> Wherefore from such let him keep well apart -<br/> The sluggard and the poor in energy.<br/> Let him consort with those who live aloof,<br/> With noble, eager, contemplative souls,<br/> With men of constant quickened energies,<br/> Yea, let him hold communion with the wise.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
