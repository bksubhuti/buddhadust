    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Through an element it is, brethren,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">The lazy flow together, meet together the lazy,<br/> the muddle-minded with the muddle-minded,<br/> the unwise with the unwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">The energetic flow together, meet together with the energetic,<br/> the levelheaded with the levelheaded,<br/> the wise with the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the past, brethren, through an element it was,<br/> that beings flowed together,<br/> met together.</p>

    <p class="f4">The lazy flowed together, met together the lazy,<br/> the muddle-minded with the muddle-minded,<br/> the unwise with the unwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">The energetic flowed together, met together with the energetic,<br/> the levelheaded with the levelheaded,<br/> the wise with the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the future, brethren, through an element it will be,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">The lazy will flow together, meet together the lazy,<br/> the muddle-minded with the muddle-minded,<br/> the unwise with the unwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">The energetic will flow together, meet together with the energetic,<br/> the levelheaded with the levelheaded,<br/> the wise with the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the present, brethren, through an element it is,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">The lazy flow together, meet together the lazy,<br/> the muddle-minded with the muddle-minded,<br/> the unwise with the unwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">The energetic flow together, meet together with the energetic,<br/> the levelheaded with the levelheaded,<br/> the wise with the wise.</p>
