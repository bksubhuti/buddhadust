    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Through an element it is, brethren,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Unbelievers flow together, meet together with unbelievers,<br/> they who take life with they who take life,<br/> they who take what is not given with they who take what is not given,<br/> they who wrongly act in desires of sense with they who wrongly act in desires of sense,<br/> the liars with the liars<br/> those given to strong drink with those given to strong drink.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the past, brethren, through an element it was,<br/> that beings flowed together,<br/> met together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Unbelievers flowed together, met together with unbelievers,<br/> those who took life with those who took life,<br/> those who took what is not given with those who took what is not given,<br/> those who wrongly acted in desires of sense with those who wrongly acted in desires of sense,<br/> the liars with the liars<br/> those given to strong drink with those given to strong drink.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the future, brethren, through an element it will be,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Unbelievers will flow together, meet together with unbelievers,<br/> they who take life with they who take life,<br/> they who take what is not given with they who take what is not given,<br/> they who wrongly act in desires of sense with they who wrongly act in desires of sense,<br/> the liars with the liars<br/> those given to strong drink with those given to strong drink.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the present, brethren, through an element it is,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Unbelievers flow together, meet together with unbelievers,<br/> they who take life with they who take life,<br/> they who take what is not given with they who take what is not given,<br/> they who wrongly act in desires of sense with they who wrongly act in desires of sense,<br/> the liars with the liars<br/> those given to strong drink with those given to strong drink.</p>
