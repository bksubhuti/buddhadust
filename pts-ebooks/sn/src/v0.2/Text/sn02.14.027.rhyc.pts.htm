    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Through an element it is, brethren,<br/> that beings flow together,<br/> meet together.</p>

    <p class="f4">Unbelievers flow together, meet together with unbelievers,<br/> they who take life with they who take life,<br/> they who take what is not given with they who take what is not given,<br/> they who wrongly act in desires of sense with they who wrongly act in desires of sense,<br/> the liars with the liars,<br/> those given to slander with those given to slander,<br/> <br/> those given to abusive speech with those given to abusive speech,<br/> those given to idle talk with those given to idle talk,<br/> the covetous with those that are covetous,<br/> the malicious with those that are malicious,<br/> those of wrong views with those of wrong views.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
