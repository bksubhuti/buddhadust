    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Before my enlightenment, brethren,<br/> to me,<br/> being unenlightened and Bodhisat only,<br/> this occurred: -</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the satisfaction,<br/> what the misery,<br/> what the escape<br/> that comes to us<br/> in connection with the earth-element?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the satisfaction,<br/> what the misery,<br/> what the escape<br/> that comes to us<br/> in connection with the water-element?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the satisfaction,<br/> what the misery,<br/> what the escape<br/> that comes to us<br/> in connection with the heat-element?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the satisfaction,<br/> what the misery,<br/> what the escape<br/> that comes to us<br/> in connection with the air-element?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">To me it occurred<br/> that the pleasure,<br/> the happiness<br/> arising <span class="f2 g"><b>[114]</b></span> through the earth-element<br/> is the satisfaction that comes<br/> in connection with the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me it occurred<br/> that the transience,<br/> the suffering,<br/> the changeful nature<br/> arising through the earth-element<br/> is the misery that comes<br/> in connection with the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me it occurred<br/> that the suppression of passion and desire,<br/> the elimination thereof<br/> in connection with the earth-element<br/> is the escape that comes<br/> in connection with the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me it occurred<br/> that the pleasure,<br/> the happiness<br/> arising through the water-element<br/> is the satisfaction that comes<br/> in connection with the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me it occurred<br/> that the transience,<br/> the suffering,<br/> the changeful nature<br/> arising through the heat-element<br/> is the misery that comes<br/> in connection with the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me it occurred<br/> that the suppression of passion and desire,<br/> the elimination thereof<br/> in connection with the heat-element<br/> is the escape that comes<br/> in connection with the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me it occurred<br/> that the pleasure,<br/> the happiness<br/> arising through the air-element<br/> is the satisfaction that comes<br/> in connection with the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me it occurred<br/> that the transience,<br/> the suffering,<br/> the changeful nature<br/> arising through the earth-element<br/> is the misery that comes<br/> in connection with the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me it occurred<br/> that the suppression of passion and desire,<br/> the elimination thereof<br/> in connection with the earth-element<br/> is the escape that comes<br/> in connection with the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">So long as I, brethren,<br/> had not fully come to know<br/> even as it really is<br/> the satisfaction as such,<br/> the misery as such,<br/> the escape as such<br/> that there is in the four elements,<br/> so long did I not discern<br/> what it was to be enlightened<br/> with supreme enlightenment<br/> with regard to the world and its deities -<br/> its Maras,<br/> its Brahmas -<br/> and to the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br/> devas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when I, brethren,<br/> had fully come to know<br/> even as it really is<br/> the satisfaction as such,<br/> the misery as such,<br/> the escape as such<br/> that there is in the four elements,<br/> then did I discern<br/> what it is to be enlightened<br/> with supreme enlightenment<br/> with regard to the world and its deities,<br/> its Maras,<br/> its Brahmas,<br/> and to the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br/> devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">And knowledge, insight arose in me<br/> that sure is my emancipation of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the last birth!</p>

    <p class="f4">Now is there no more rebecoming!</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> In his comments B. reads into these four the more abstract meanings - extension, cohesion, calorific property, mobility - that they came to have in later Abhidhamma. He refers throughout to their presence in the human body. The three characteristics here discerned in the four elements are also discerned in the senses, <i>S.</i> iv, 7-13; v, 194, 203 <i>f.;</i> in the bodily and mental factors in general, <i>ib.</i> iii, 81, 160 etc.; in feeling in particular, <i>ib.</i> iv, 208, 234; in sense-desires, <i>M.</i> i, 85, 92. Suttas 31, 32 occur in <i>A.</i> i, 258 <i>f.</i> and 33 in <i>A.</i> i, 260, where 'the elements' are replaced by 'the world.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Deities and devas are in the text both <i>deva: - sa-devake, sa-deva-manussāya.</i> We have no word that does not mislead, for to the Buddhist devas were not gods in the Vedic or the Greek or Christian sense, nor were they 'spirits,' since they were not 'discarnate.'</p>
