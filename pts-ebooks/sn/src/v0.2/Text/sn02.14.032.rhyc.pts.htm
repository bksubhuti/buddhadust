    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br/> that comes from the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br/> that comes from the earth-element<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br/> that comes from the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br/> that comes from the earth-element<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br/> from the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br/> from the earth-element.<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br/> that comes from the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br/> that comes from the water-element<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br/> that comes from the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br/> that comes from the water-element<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br/> from the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br/> from the water-element,<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br/> that comes from the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br/> that comes from the heat-element<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br/> that comes from the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br/> that comes from the heat-element<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br/> from the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br/> from the heat-element,<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br/> that comes from the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br/> that comes from the air-element<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br/> that comes from the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br/> that comes from the air-element<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br/> from the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br/> from the air-element,<br/> so that by insight<br/> I saw it well.</p>

    <p class="f4">So long as I, brethren,<br/> had not fully come to know<br/> even as it really is<br/> the satisfaction as such,<br/> the misery as such,<br/> the escape as such<br/> that there is in the four elements,<br/> so long did I not discern<br/> what it was to be enlightened<br/> with supreme enlightenment<br/> with regard to the world and its deities -<br/> its Maras,<br/> its Brahmas -<br/> and to the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br/> devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when I, brethren,<br/> had fully come to know<br/> even as it really is<br/> the satisfaction as such,<br/> the misery as such,<br/> the escape as such<br/> that there is in the four elements,<br/> then did I discern<br/> what it is to be enlightened<br/> with supreme enlightenment<br/> with regard to the world and its deities,<br/> its Maras,<br/> its Brahmas,<br/> and to the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br/> devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">And knowledge, insight arose in me<br/> that sure is my emancipation of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the last birth!</p>

    <p class="f4">Now is there no more rebecoming!</p>
