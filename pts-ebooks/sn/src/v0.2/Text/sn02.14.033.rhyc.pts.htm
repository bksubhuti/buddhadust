    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"If there were not, brethren,<br/> this satisfaction that comes from the earth-element,<br/> beings would not lust after the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/> this satisfaction that comes from the earth-element,<br/> beings lust after the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it were not, brethren,<br/> that misery comes from the earth-element,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/> that misery comes from the earth-element,<br/> beings are repelled by the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it were not, brethren, that there is<br/> escape from the earth-element,<br/> beings could not escape from the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as that there is<br/> escape from the earth-element,<br/> beings do escape from the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If there were not, brethren,<br/> this satisfaction that comes from the water-element,<br/> beings would not lust after the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/> this satisfaction that comes from the water-element,<br/> beings lust after the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it were not, brethren,<br/> that misery comes from the water-element,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/> that misery comes from the water-element,<br/> beings are repelled by the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it were not, brethren, that there is<br/> escape from the water-element,<br/> beings could not escape from the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as that there is<br/> escape from the water-element,<br/> beings do escape from the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If there were not, brethren,<br/> this satisfaction that comes from the heat-element,<br/> beings would not lust after the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/> this satisfaction that comes from the heat-element,<br/> beings lust after the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it were not, brethren,<br/> that misery comes from the heat-element,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/> that misery comes from the heat-element,<br/> beings are repelled by the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it were not, brethren, that there is<br/> escape from the heat-element,<br/> beings could not escape from the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as that there is<br/> escape from the heat-element,<br/> beings do escape from the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If there were not, brethren,<br/> this satisfaction that comes from the air-element,<br/> beings would not lust after the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/> this satisfaction that comes from the air-element,<br/> beings lust after the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it were not, brethren,<br/> that misery comes from the air-element,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/> that misery comes from the air-element,<br/> beings are repelled by the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">If it were not, brethren, that there is<br/> escape from the air-element,<br/> beings could not escape from the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as that there is<br/> escape from the air-element,<br/> beings do escape from the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so is it in the satisfaction, the misery, the escape that come from the other three elements.</p>

    <p class="f4">In so far, brethren, as beings<br/> have not fully come to know,<br/> even as it really is,<br/> the satisfaction as such,<br/> the misery as such,<br/> the escape as such<br/> in these four elements,<br/> they have not lived aloof,<br/> detached,<br/> separate,<br/> disassociated,<br/> with the barriers to the mind<br/> done away with,<br/> from the world and its deities -<br/> its Maras,<br/> its Brahmas -<br/> and from the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br/> devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when, brethren,<br/> beings have fully come to know,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the satisfaction as such,<br/> the misery as such,<br/> the escape as such<br/> in these four elements,<br/> then do beings live aloof,<br/> detached,<br/> separate,<br/> disassociated,<br/> with the barriers to the mind<br/> done away with,<br/> from the world and its deities -<br/> its Maras,<br/> its Brahmas -<br/> and from the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br/> devas and men.</p>
