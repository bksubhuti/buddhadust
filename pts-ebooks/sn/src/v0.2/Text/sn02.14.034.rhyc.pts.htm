    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"If this earth-element, brethren,<br/> were entirely painful,<br/> beset with pain,<br/> immersed in pain,<br/> not immersed in happiness,<br/> beings would not be lusting after the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as this earth-element, brethren,<br/> is pleasant,<br/> beset with pleasure,<br/> immersed in <span class="f2 g"><b>[116]</b></span> pleasure,<br/> not in pain,<br/> therefore it is<br/> that beings get lusting after the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If this water-element, brethren,<br/> were entirely painful,<br/> beset with pain,<br/> immersed in pain,<br/> not immersed in happiness,<br/> beings would not be lusting after the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as this water-element, brethren,<br/> is pleasant,<br/> beset with pleasure,<br/> immersed in pleasure,<br/> not in pain,<br/> therefore it is<br/> that beings get lusting after the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If this heat-element, brethren,<br/> were entirely painful,<br/> beset with pain,<br/> immersed in pain,<br/> not immersed in happiness,<br/> beings would not be lusting after the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as this heat-element, brethren,<br/> is pleasant,<br/> beset with pleasure,<br/> immersed in pleasure,<br/> not in pain,<br/> therefore it is<br/> that beings get lusting after the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If this air-element, brethren,<br/> were entirely painful,<br/> beset with pain,<br/> immersed in pain,<br/> not immersed in happiness,<br/> beings would not be lusting after the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as this air-element, brethren,<br/> is pleasant,<br/> beset with pleasure,<br/> immersed in pleasure,<br/> not in pain,<br/> therefore it is<br/> that beings get lusting after the air-element.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">If this earth-element, brethren,<br/> were entirely pleasant,<br/> beset with pleasure,<br/> immersed in pleasure,<br/> not immersed in pain,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as the earth-element<br/> is painful,<br/> is beset with pain,<br/> immersed in pain,<br/> not immersed in pleasure,<br/> therefore it is that beings are repelled by the earth-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">If this water-element, brethren,<br/> were entirely pleasant,<br/> beset with pleasure,<br/> immersed in pleasure,<br/> not immersed in pain,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the water-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">If this heat-element, brethren,<br/> were entirely pleasant,<br/> beset with pleasure,<br/> immersed in pleasure,<br/> not immersed in pain,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the heat-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as the heat-element<br/> is painful,<br/> is beset with pain,<br/> immersed in pain,<br/> not immersed in pleasure,<br/> therefore it is that beings are repelled by the heat-element.</p>
