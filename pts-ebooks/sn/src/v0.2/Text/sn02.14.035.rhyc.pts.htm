    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who takes delight, brethren, in the earth-element,<br/> takes delight in pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes delight in pain,<br/> he, I say,<br/> is not set wholly free from pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who takes delight, brethren, in the water-element,<br/> takes delight in pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes delight in pain,<br/> he, I say,<br/> is not set wholly free from pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who takes delight, brethren, in the heat-element,<br/> takes delight in pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes delight in pain,<br/> he, I say,<br/> is not set wholly free from pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who takes delight, brethren, in the air-element,<br/> takes delight in pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes delight in pain,<br/> he, I say,<br/> is not set wholly free from pain.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes no delight in the earth-element,<br/> takes no delight in pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes no delight in pain,<br/> he, I say,<br/> is set wholly free from pain.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes no delight in the water-element,<br/> takes no delight in pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes no delight in pain,<br/> he, I say,<br/> is set wholly free from pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes no delight in the heat-element,<br/> takes no delight in pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes no delight in pain,<br/> he, I say,<br/> is set wholly free from pain.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Most of these Suttas are repeated with amplifications in chap. xxxv, 2. 'Pain' must not be understood here as actual suffering, bodily or mental, but as the liability to suffering inherent in our present life-as 'ill.' <i>Cf.</i> my <i>Bud. Psych.,</i> p. 83<i>f.</i> To be 'set wholly free from' this (<i>parimutto, cf.</i> <i>Dialogues,</i> i, 96, 1, 2; <i>Milinda</i> ii, 217) is to be quit of desire to prolong life in any of the worlds. So above, p. 24. And 'delight in pain' must mean: delight in things wherein liability to suffering may become actualized.</p>
