    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"That, brethren, which is the uprising,<br/> the persisting,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the manifestation of the earth-element,<br/> that is the uprising,<br/> the persisting,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the manifestation of pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">"That, brethren, which is the uprising,<br/> the persisting,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the manifestation of the water-element,<br/> that is the uprising,<br/> the persisting,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the manifestation of pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">"That, brethren, which is the uprising,<br/> the persisting,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the manifestation of the fire-element,<br/> that is the uprising,<br/> the persisting,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the manifestation of pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">"That, brethren, which is the uprising,<br/> the persisting,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the manifestation of the air-element,<br/> that is the uprising,<br/> the persisting,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the manifestation of pain.</p>
