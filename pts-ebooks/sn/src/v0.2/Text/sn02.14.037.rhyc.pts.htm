    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are these four elements, brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Which are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Earth-element,<br/> water-element,<br/> heat-element,<br/> air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, any recluses or brahmins whatever<br/> who do not understand,<br/> even as it really is,<br/> the satisfaction,<br/> the misery,<br/> the escape<br/> with regard to these four elements,<br/> they for me<br/> are not approved of among recluses as recluses<br/> nor among brahmins as brahmins,<br/> nor have those venerable ones<br/> come even in this life<br/> fully to know of themselves,<br/> to realize,<br/> to live<br/> in the attainment of,<br/> the good of<br/> being recluse or brahmin.</p>

    <p class="f4">But any recluses or brahmins whatever<br/> who do understand,<br/> even as it really is,<br/> the satisfaction,<br/> the misery,<br/> the escape<br/> with regard to these four elements,<br/> they for me<br/> are approved of among recluses as recluses<br/> or among brahmins as brahmins,<br/> and those venerable ones have come<br/> even in this life<br/> fully to know of themselves,<br/> to realize,<br/> to live<br/> in the attainment of,<br/> the good of<br/> being recluse or brahmin.</p>
