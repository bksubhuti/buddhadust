    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the running on, the faring on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">Which is greater: -<br/> the flood of tears<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> shed by you<br/> crying and weeping<br/> as ye fare on,<br/> run on this long while,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> united as ye have been<br/> with the undesirable,<br/> sundered as ye have been<br/> from the desirable,<br/> or the waters in the four seas?</p>

    <p class="f4">'As we allow, lord,<br/> that we have been taught by the Exalted One,<br/> it is this that is greater:<br/> the flood of tears shed by us<br/> crying and weeping<br/> as we fare on,<br/> run on this long while,<br/> united as we have been<br/> with the undesirable,<br/> separated as we have been<br/> from the desirable -<br/> not the waters in the four seas.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well said!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, brethren!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well do ye allow that so has the doctrine been taught by me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Truly the flood of tears shed by you<br/> crying and weeping<br/> as ye fare on,<br/> run on this long while,<br/> united as ye have been<br/> with the undesirable,<br/> sundered as ye have been<br/> from the desirable is greater -<br/> not the waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">'For many a long day, brethren,<br/> have ye experienced the death of mother.</p>

    <p class="f4">Greater is the flood of tears shed by you<br/> crying and weeping over the death of mother,<br/> as ye fare on,<br/> run on this many a long day,<br/> united with the undesirable,<br/> sundered from the desirable,<br/> than are the waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">'For many a long day, brethren,<br/> have ye experienced the death of brother.</p>

    <p class="f4">Greater is the flood of tears shed by you<br/> crying and weeping over the death of brother,<br/> as ye fare on,<br/> run on this many a long day,<br/> united with the undesirable,<br/> sundered from the desirable,<br/> than are the waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">'For many a long day, brethren,<br/> have ye experienced the the ruin of kinsfolk.</p>

    <p class="f4">Greater is the flood of tears shed by you<br/> crying and weeping over the the ruin of kinsfolk,<br/> as ye fare on,<br/> run on this many a long day,<br/> united with the undesirable,<br/> sundered from the desirable,<br/> than are the waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">'For many a long day, brethren,<br/> have ye experienced the the ruin of wealth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Greater is the flood of tears shed by you<br/> crying and weeping over the the ruin of wealth,<br/> as ye fare on,<br/> run on this many a long day,<br/> united with the undesirable,<br/> sundered from the desirable,<br/> than are the waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.<br/> The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the faring on, running on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to be repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be delivered therefrom."</p>
