    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the running on, the faring on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that what think ye brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">Which is greater:</p>

    <p class="f4">- the mother's milk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> that ye have drunk<br/> as ye have fared on,<br/> run on this long while,<br/> or the water in the four seas?</p>

    <p class="f4">As we allow, lord,<br/> that we have been taught by the Exalted One,<br/> it is this, lord, that is greater:<br/> the mother's milk drunk by us<br/> as we have fared on,<br/> run on this long while,<br/> and not the water in the four seas.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, brethren!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well do ye allow that<br/> so has the doctrine been taught by me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Truly the mother's milk that ye have drunk<br/> as ye have fared on,<br/> run on this long while is greater,<br/> and not the water in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the faring on, running on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus many a day, brethren,<br/> have ye been suffering ill,<br/> have ye been suffering pain,<br/> have ye been suffering disaster,<br/> have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to be repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be delivered therefrom.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>
