    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side<br/> he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"How long, lord, is an aeon?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Long, brother, is an aeon.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is not easy to reckon how long<br/> by saying so many years,<br/> so many centuries,<br/> so many thousand centuries."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Can it be told, lord, by a parable?</p>

    <p class="f4">"It can, brother", said the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, brother, there were a city of iron [walls]<br/> one yojana in length,<br/> one in width,<br/> one yojana high,<br/> filled up with mustard-seed<br/> [to the top as if] turban-bound.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Therefrom a man were to take out<br/> at the end of every hundred years<br/> a mustard-seed.</p>

    <p class="f4">That great pile of mustard-seed, brother,<br/> would in this way<br/> be sooner done away with and ended<br/> than an aeon.</p>

    <p class="f4">So long, brother, is an aeon.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of aeons thus long<br/> more than one has passed,<br/> more than a hundred have passed,<br/> more than a thousand,<br/> more than a hundred thousand.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brother, of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the faring on, running on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus many a day, brother,<br/> have ye been suffering ill,<br/> have ye been suffering pain,<br/> have ye been suffering disaster,<br/> have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brother,<br/> for you to be repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be delivered therefrom.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>
