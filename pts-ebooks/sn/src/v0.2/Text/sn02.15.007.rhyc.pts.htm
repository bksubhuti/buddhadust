    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now many brethren came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and took seats at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated they said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"How many aeons, lord, have passed and gone by?"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[123]</b></span> "Many, brethren, are the aeons passed and gone by."</p>

    <p class="f4">Them it is not easy to count up:<br/> so many aeons,<br/> so many hundreds,<br/> so many thousands,<br/> so many hundred thousand aeons."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Can it be done, lord, by a parable?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It can, brethren," said the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose that there were four disciples<br/> who went on living here for a century,<br/> and they were to recollect each day<br/> a hundred thousand aeons.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">The aeons should be just recalled by them.</p>

    <p class="f4">And at the lapse of the century<br/> they were to die.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so many aeons, brethren,<br/> have passed and gone by.</p>

    <p class="f4">Them it is not easy to count up:<br/> so many aeons,<br/> so many hundreds,<br/> so many thousands,<br/> so many hundred thousand aeons."</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the faring on, running on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus many a day, brethren,<br/> have ye been suffering ill,<br/> have ye been suffering pain,<br/> have ye been suffering disaster,<br/> have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to be repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be delivered therefrom.</p>
