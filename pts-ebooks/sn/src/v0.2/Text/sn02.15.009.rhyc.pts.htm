    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the running on, the faring on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as a stick, brethren,<br/> thrown up into the air,<br/> falls now on the butt-end,<br/> now on its side,<br/> now on its tip,<br/> even so do beings,<br/> cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied by craving,<br/> running on,<br/> faring on,<br/> go now from this world to the other world,<br/> now from the other world to this.</p>

    <p class="f4">How is this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the faring on, running on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus many a day, brethren,<br/> have ye been suffering ill,<br/> have ye been suffering pain,<br/> have ye been suffering disaster,<br/> have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to be repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be delivered therefrom.</p>
