    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was at Rājagaha<br/> on Vulture's Peak.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the running on, the faring on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">The bones of one single person, brethren, running on, faring <span class="f2 g"><b>[125]</b></span> on for an aeon would be a cairn, a pile, a heap as great as Mount Vepulla, were there a collector of those bones and the collection were not destroyed.</p>

    <p class="f4">How is this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the faring on, running on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus many a day, brethren,<br/> have ye been suffering ill,<br/> have ye been suffering pain,<br/> have ye been suffering disaster,<br/> have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to be repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be delivered therefrom."</p>

    <p class="f4">This spake the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Well-farer saying this, the Master said this further:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The pile of bones of [all the bodies of] one man<br/> Who has alone one aeon lived,</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Were heaped a mountain high - so said the mighty seer -<br/> Yea, reckoned high as Vipula</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">To north of Vulture's Peak, crag-fort of Magadha.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> When he with perfect insight sees</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The Ariyan Truths: - what suffering is and how it comes<br/> And how it may be overpassed,</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The Ariyan Eightfold Path, the way all ill to abate -<br/> Seven times at most reborn, a man</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Yet running on, through breaking every fetter down,<br/> Endmaker doth become of ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>
