    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he addressed the brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.<br/> The earliest point is not revealed of the running on,<br/> the faring on of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">When, brethren, ye behold that which is happy, prosperous,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>,<br/> then should ye thus judge:<br/> — We too have enjoyed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> on this wise<br/> down that long time.</p>

    <p class="f4">How is this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.<br/> The earliest point is not revealed of the running on,<br/> the faring on of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to be repelled by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be delivered therefrom.</p>
