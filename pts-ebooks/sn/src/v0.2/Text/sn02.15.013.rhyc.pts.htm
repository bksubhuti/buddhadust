    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was at Rājagaha<br/> at the Bamboo Grove:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now thirty brethren only,<br/> from Pāvā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> all forest dwellers,<br/> all almsmen,<br/> all rag-robed,<br/> all three-garment-men,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> all not yet fetter-free<br/> came to the Exalted One<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at the side of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now he thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"These thirty from Pāvā<br/> all forest-dwellers,<br/> all almsmen,<br/> all rag-robed,<br/> all three-garment-men,<br/> all not yet fetter-free,<br/> what if I were now so to teach them such a doctrine,<br/> that at this very sitting<br/> their hearts were to be liberated,<br/> without grasping,<br/> from the intoxicants?"</p>

    <p class="f4">So he addressed them:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> they responded.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br/> of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span> The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the running on,<br/> the faring on<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied by craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">Which is the greater?</p>

    <p class="f4">The blood that has flowed,<br/> that has been shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> as ye have run on,<br/> fared on<br/> this long while,<br/> or the waters in the four seas?</p>

    <p class="f4">As we allow, lord,<br/> that we have been taught by the Exalted One,<br/> it is this that is greater,<br/> even the blood that has flowed,<br/> that has been shed<br/> by the loss of our heads<br/> as we have run on,<br/> fared on<br/> this long while,<br/> and not the waters of the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said!<br/> well said, brethren!<br/> well do ye allow<br/> that I have thus taught you the doctrine.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even the blood that has flowed,<br/> that has been shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> as you have run on,<br/> fared on<br/> this long while,<br/> that is greater,<br/> and not the waters of the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were oxen,<br/> born as oxen,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were buffaloes,<br/> born as buffaloes,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were rams<br/> born as rams,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were goats,<br/> born as goats,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were as wild beasts,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> born as wild beasts,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were fowls,<br/> born as fowls,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were swine<br/> born as swine,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were seized as robbers,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were seized as village-plunderers,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were seized as highwaymen,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">For many a long day<br/> did blood flow,<br/> was blood shed<br/> by the loss of your heads<br/> when ye were seized as adulterers,<br/> more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

    <p class="f4">How is this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br/> of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of beings running on,<br/> faring on,<br/> cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus many a day, brethren,<br/> have ye been suffering ill,<br/> have ye been suffering pain,<br/> have ye been suffering disaster,<br/> have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to be repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be delivered therefrom."</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pleased at heart<br/> those brethren took delight<br/> in that which was spoken by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And during the speaking of this catechism<br/> the hearts <span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span> of the thirty Pāvā brothers were set free,<br/> without any grasping,<br/> from the intoxicants.</p>
