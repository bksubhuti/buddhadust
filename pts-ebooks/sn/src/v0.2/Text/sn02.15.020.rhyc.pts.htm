    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was at Rājagaha<br/> on Vulture's Peak.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br/> of this faring on.</p>

    <p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/> of the running on, the faring on,<br/> of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/> tied to craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">There was once a time, brethren,<br/> when this Mount Vipula<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> was given the name East Ridge.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time<br/> the people [here] were given the name of Tivaras,<br/> and the measure of their life<br/> was forty thousand years.</p>

    <p class="f4">It took those Tivaras <span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span> four days<br/> to climb Mount East Ridge<br/> and four days to descend it.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time Kakusandha,<br/> Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> Buddha Supreme,<br/> had arisen in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he had a pair of disciples as chief,<br/> Vidhura and Sañjīva,<br/> a comely pair.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Behold, brethren,<br/> how both the name of this hill has disappeared,<br/> how those people have died<br/> and how that Exalted One<br/> has passed utterly away!</p>

    <p class="f4">So impermanent, brethren,<br/> are the things of this world,<br/> so transient are they,<br/> so comfortless are they.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to feel repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be liberated therefrom.</p>

    <p class="f4">There was once a time, brethren,<br/> when this Mount Vipula<br/> was given the name of Vankaka.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">At that time the people [here]<br/> were given the name of Rohitassas,<br/> and the measure of their life<br/> was thirty thousand years.</p>

    <p class="f4">It took those Rohitassas<br/> three days to climb Mount Vankaka<br/> and three days to descend it.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time Konāgamana,<br/> Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> Buddha Supreme,<br/> had arisen in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he had a pair of disciples as chief,<br/> Bhiyyosa and Uttara,<br/> a comely pair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Behold, brethren,<br/> how both the name of this hill has disappeared,<br/> how those people have died<br/> and how that Exalted One<br/> has passed utterly away!</p>

    <p class="f4">So impermanent, brethren,<br/> are the things of this world,<br/> so transient are they,<br/> so comfortless are they.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to feel repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be liberated therefrom.</p>

    <p class="f4">There was once a time, brethren,<br/> when this Mount Vipula<br/> was given the name of Fairside.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time the people [here]<br/> were given the name of Suppiyas,<br/> and the measure of their life<br/> was twenty thousand years.</p>

    <p class="f4">It took those Suppiyas<br/> two days to climb Mount Fairside<br/> and two days to descend it.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time Kassapa,<br/> Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> Buddha Supreme<br/> had arisen in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he had a pair of disciples as chief,<br/> Tissa and Bhāradvāja,<br/> a comely pair.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span> Behold, brethren,<br/> how both the name of this hill has disappeared,<br/> how those people have died<br/> and how that Exalted One<br/> has passed utterly away!</p>

    <p class="f4">So impermanent, brethren,<br/> are the things of this world,<br/> so transient are they,<br/> so comfortless are they.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to feel repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be liberated therefrom.</p>

    <p class="f4">But now, brethren, to this Mount Vipula<br/> has come just the name 'Vipula.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But now, brethren, to these people<br/> has come just the name 'Magadhese'.</p>

    <p class="f4">The measure of the age of the Magadhese<br/> is small,<br/> very limited,<br/> fleeting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who lives long<br/> lives for a hundred years<br/> or but little more.</p>

    <p class="f4">The men of Magadha<br/> climb Mount Vipula<br/> in a little while,<br/> descend it in a little while.</p>

    <p class="f4">But now, brethren,<br/> I have arisen in the world,<br/> Arahant,<br/> Buddha Supreme.</p>

    <p class="f4">But I have a pair of disciples as chief,<br/> Sāriputta and Moggallāna,<br/> a comely pair.</p>

    <p class="f4">There will come a time, brethren,<br/> when both the name of this hill will disappear,<br/> when these people will die<br/> and when I shall pass utterly away.</p>

    <p class="f4">So impermanent, brethren,<br/> are the things of this world,<br/> so transient are they,<br/> so comfortless are they.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/> for you to feel repelled<br/> by all the things of this world,<br/> enough to lose all passion for them,<br/> enough to be liberated therefrom.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this;<br/> the Well-farer so speaking,<br/> the Master spake this further:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">East Ridge this mountain for the Tivaras,<br/> And Crooked Crest for Rohitassa folk,<br/> Fairside its name among the Suppiyas,<br/> Now for the Magadhese't is Vipula.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Alas! impermanent is all this world.<br/> Growth is its very nature and decay.<br/> Things spring to being and again they cease.<br/> Happy the mastery of them and the peace.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>
