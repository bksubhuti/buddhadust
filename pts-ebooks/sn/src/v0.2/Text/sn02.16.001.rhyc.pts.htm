    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Contented, brethren, is this Kassapa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> with no matter what robe.</p>

    <p class="f4">He commends contentment<br/> with no matter what robe,<br/> nor because of a robe<br/> doth he commit anything that is unseemly or unfit.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he have gotten no robe,<br/> he is not perturbed;<br/> if he have gotten a robe,<br/> he enjoys it without clinging or infatuation,<br/> committing no fault,<br/> discerning danger,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> wise as to escape.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren, thus should ye train yourselves:</p>

    <p class="f4">"We will be contented with no matter what robe.</p>

    <p class="f4">We will commend contentment<br/> with no matter what robe,<br/> nor because of robes<br/> will we commit anything that is unseemly or unfit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus should ye train yourselves.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily by Kassapa, brethren,<br/> will I exhort you, or by one like Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">By them exhorted<br/> ye are to practise<br/> that ye may so attain.</p>
