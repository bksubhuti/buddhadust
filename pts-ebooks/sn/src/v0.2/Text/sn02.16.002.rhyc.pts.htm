    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Mahā-Kassapa and the venerable Sāriputta were once staying near Benares<br/> at Isipatana at the Deer Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta had arisen at eventide from meditation<br/> and he came to Mahā-Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">After exchanging greetings and talk of courtesy and friendliness<br/> he sat down by Mahā-Kassapa and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is said, friend Kassapa,<br/> that without ardour<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> and without care<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> a man is incapable of enlightenment,<br/> incapable of Nibbāna,<br/> incapable of reaching the uttermost safety,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> but that with ardour and with care<br/> he is capable of enlightenment,<br/> capable of Nibbāna,<br/> capable of reaching the uttermost safety.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now how far is this so<br/> that without ardour<br/> and without care<br/> a man is incapable of enlightenment,<br/> incapable of Nibbāna,<br/> incapable of reaching the uttermost safety,<br/> but that with ardour and with care<br/> he is capable of enlightenment,<br/> capable of Nibbāna,<br/> capable of reaching the uttermost safety?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"When, friend, a brother thinks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have not arisen,<br/> were they to arise,<br/> would conduce to my hurt'<br/> - and no ardour is aroused.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have arisen,<br/> if they are not eliminated,<br/> would conduce to my hurt,'<br/> - and no ardour is aroused.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Good states that have not arisen,<br/> were they not to arise,<br/> would conduce to my hurt,'<br/> - and no ardour is aroused.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Good states that have arisen,<br/> were they to cease,<br/> would conduce to my hurt,'<br/> - and no ardour is aroused.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">This is to be without ardour.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, friend, is a man without care?</p>

    <p class="f4">"When, friend, a brother thinks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have not arisen,<br/> were they to arise,<br/> would conduce to my hurt'<br/> - and no care is aroused.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have arisen,<br/> if they are not eliminated,<br/> would conduce to my hurt,'<br/> - and no care is aroused.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Good states that have not arisen,<br/> were they not to arise,<br/> would conduce to my hurt,'<br/> - and no care is aroused.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Good states that have arisen,<br/> were they to cease,<br/> would conduce to my hurt,'<br/> - and no care is aroused.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">This is to be without care.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is, friend,<br/> that a man who is without ardour,<br/> without <span class="f2 g"><b>[133]</b></span> care,<br/> is incapable of enlightenment,<br/> incapable of Nibbāna,<br/> incapable of the uttermost security.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, friend, is he ardent?</p>

    <p class="f4">"When, friend, a brother thinks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have not arisen,<br/> were they to arise,<br/> would conduce to my hurt'<br/> - and ardour is aroused.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Good states that have arisen,<br/> were they to cease,<br/> would conduce to my hurt,'<br/> - and ardour is aroused.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">This is to have ardour.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, friend, is he careful?</p>

    <p class="f4">"When, friend, a brother thinks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have not arisen,<br/> were they to arise,<br/> would conduce to my hurt'<br/> - and care is aroused.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have arisen,<br/> if they are not eliminated,<br/> would conduce to my hurt,'<br/> - and care is aroused.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is to have care.</p>
