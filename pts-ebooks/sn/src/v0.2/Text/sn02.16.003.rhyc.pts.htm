    <p><span class="f2">[197]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[133]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Be ye comparable to the moon, brethren,<br/> when ye go among the families,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> drawing back<br/> in both heart and demeanour,<br/> ever as new-comers<br/> unobtrusive among the families.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Just as a man would contemplate a decayed well,<br/> or a precipice,<br/> or a river-swamp,<br/> drawing back<br/> in both heart and demeanour,<br/> even so be ye among the families.</p>

    <p class="f4">Kassapa, brethren,<br/> is comparable to the moon<br/> when he goes among the families,<br/> drawing back<br/> in both heart and demeanour,<br/> ever as a new-comer<br/> unobtrusive among the families.</p>

    <p class="f4">What think ye, brethren, as to that?</p>

    <p class="f4">What manner of brother<br/> is worthy to go among the families?</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root,<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br/> if the meaning of this that he has spoken<br/> were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/> the brethren will bear it in mind.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One waved his hand in space.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just as this hand, brethren,<br/> does not sink down in space,<br/> nor is seized,<br/> nor bound,<br/> even so that brother, whose heart<br/> when he <span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span> goes among the families<br/> does not sink down,<br/> or get seized<br/> or bound,<br/> but thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let them who desire gains,<br/> gain!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them who desire merit,<br/> work merit!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let a man be pleased and joyous,<br/> at the gains of others,<br/> even as he is pleased and joyous<br/> at his own gains!'</p>

    <p class="f4">This manner of brother<br/> is worthy to go among the families.</p>

    <p class="f4">Kassapa, brethren,<br/> when he goes among the families<br/> does not let his heart sink down,<br/> or get seized,<br/> or bound.</p>

    <p class="f4">He thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let them who desire gains,<br/> gain!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them who desire merit,<br/> work merit!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let a man be pleased and joyous<br/> at the gains of others,<br/> even as he is pleased and joyous<br/> at his own gains!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Such a brother, brethren,<br/> is worthy to go among the families.</p>

    <p class="f4">What think ye, brethren,<br/> as to this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what manner of brother<br/> is the teaching of doctrine impure?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what manner of brother<br/> is the teaching of the doctrine pure?</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br/> things have the Exalted One as their root,<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well, indeed, were it<br/> if the meaning of this that he has spoken<br/> were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/> the brethren will bear it in mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, brethren, listen,<br/> give your mind thoroughly,<br/> I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/> they responded.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">Any brother, brethren,<br/> who teaches doctrine with such a mind:</p>

    <p class="f4">'0 that they may hear my doctrine,<br/> and hearing it may be satisfied,<br/> and being satisfied<br/> may give expression to their satisfaction!'</p>

    <p class="f4">of this manner of brother<br/> the teaching of doctrine is impure.</p>

    <p class="f4">But that brother who teaches doctrine to others<br/> with such a mind:</p>

    <p class="f4">'0 that they may hear my doctrine, -<br/> for it is the doctrine<br/> which the Exalted One hath so well declared,<br/> relating to the present,<br/> not a matter of time;<br/> the doctrine that says:<br/> "Come, see!"<br/> that leads on,<br/> that is to be understood by the wise<br/> each man for himself, -<br/> and hearing it,<br/> may acknowledge the doctrine,<br/> and acknowledging it,<br/> may practise<br/> that they may so attain!'</p>

    <p class="f4">he thus teaches doctrine to others<br/> because of the fair order of the Norm,<br/> he teaches doctrine to others<br/> out of pity,<br/> out of caring for them,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span> because of his compassion for them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such manner of brother<br/> the teaching of doctrine is very pure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Kassapa, brethren, teaches the doctrine<br/> with such a mind:</p>

    <p class="f4">'0 that they may hear my doctrine, -<br/> for it is the doctrine<br/> which the Exalted One hath so well declared,<br/> relating to the present,<br/> not a matter of time;<br/> the doctrine that says:<br/> "Come, see!"<br/> that leads on,<br/> that is to be understood by the wise<br/> each man for himself, -<br/> and hearing it,<br/> may acknowledge the doctrine,<br/> and acknowledging it,<br/> may practise<br/> that they may so attain!'</p>

    <p class="f4">he thus teaches doctrine to others<br/> because of the fair order of the Norm,<br/> he teaches doctrine to others<br/> out of pity,<br/> out of caring for them,<br/> because of his compassion for them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such manner of brother<br/> the teaching of doctrine is very pure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily by Kassapa, brethren,<br/> will I exhort you,<br/> or by one like Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">By them exhorted<br/> ye are to practise<br/> that ye may so attain.</p>
