    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What think ye as to this, brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">What manner of brother is worthy,<br/> and what manner of brother is unworthy<br/> to go among the families?</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root,<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br/> if the meaning of this that he has spoken<br/> were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/> the brethren will bear it in mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, brethren, listen,<br/> give your mind thoroughly,<br/> I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/> they responded.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, brethren, if a brother go among the families with such a mind:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let them only give!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them not refuse to give!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give to me abundantly, not scantily!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them give me excellent things only, not poor things!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give quickly, not tardily!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give to me respectfully, not disrespectfully!'</p>

    <p class="f4">He, going among the families with such thoughts,<br/> if they give not, is vexed,<br/> and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, going among the families with such thoughts,<br/> if they give scantily, is vexed,<br/> and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, going among the families with such thoughts,<br/> if they give poor things, is vexed,<br/> and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, going among the families with such thoughts,<br/> if they give tardily, is vexed,<br/> and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, going among the families with such thoughts,<br/> if they give disrespectfully, is vexed,<br/> and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">This manner of brother<br/> is unworthy to go among the families.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">But that brother who goes among the families<br/> with such a mind:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How could I possibly think<br/> on this occasion<br/> with regard to others,</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let them only give!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them not refuse to give!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give to me abundantly,<br/> not scantily.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give to me excellent things,<br/> not poor things.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give to me quickly,<br/> not tardily.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give to me respectfully,<br/> not disrespectfully!"'</p>

    <p class="f4">He, when they give not,<br/> is not vexed,<br/> nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">So, too, if they give scantily,<br/> is not vexed,<br/> nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, when they give poor things,<br/> is not vexed,<br/> nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, when they give tardily,<br/> is not vexed,<br/> nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, when they give disrespectfully,<br/> is not vexed,<br/> nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such a manner of brother<br/> is worthy to go among the families.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Kassapa, brethren, is of such a mind<br/> as he goes among the families:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How could I possibly think<br/> on this occasion<br/> with regard to others:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let them only give!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them not refuse to give!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give to me abundantly,<br/> not scantily.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give to me excellent things,<br/> not poor things.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give to me quickly,<br/> not tardily.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them only give to me respectfully,<br/> not disrespectfully!"'</p>

    <p class="f4">He, when they give not,<br/> is not vexed,<br/> nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">So, too, if they give scantily,<br/> is not vexed,<br/> nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, when they give poor things,<br/> is not vexed,<br/> nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, when they give tardily,<br/> is not vexed,<br/> nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, when they give disrespectfully,<br/> is not vexed,<br/> nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such a manner of brother<br/> is worthy to go among the families.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, brethren, by <span class="f2 g"><b>[136]</b></span> Kassapa will I exhort you,<br/> or by one like Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">By them exhorted<br/> ye are to practise<br/> that ye may so attain.</p>
