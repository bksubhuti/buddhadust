    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was at Rājagaha<br/> at the Bamboo Grove:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Kassapa came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him,<br/> and sat down at his side.</p>

    <p class="f4">To him so seated<br/> the Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thou art old, Kassapa,<br/> and these coarse cast-off rags<br/> are past wearing<br/> and irksome to thee.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore do thou, Kassapa,<br/> wear the raiment [given] by householders<br/> and enjoy their invitations<br/> and abide near me."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, lord, for many a day<br/> have been a forest dweller<br/> and have commended forest life;<br/> have been an almsman<br/> and have commended alms-living;<br/> have been a rag-robe wearer<br/> and have commended rag-robe wearing;<br/> have been a three-garment man<br/> and have commended the triple-raiment;<br/> have wanted little<br/> and have commended few wants;<br/> have been contented<br/> and have commended contentment;<br/> have dwelt in seclusion<br/> and have commended seclusion;<br/> have held aloof from society<br/> and have commended such aloofness;<br/> have lived in strenuous energy<br/> and have commended strenuous energy."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But what advantage dost thou, Kassapa,<br/> discern in this<br/> that for many a day<br/> thou hast been a forest dweller<br/> and have commended forest life;<br/> have been an almsman<br/> and have commended alms-living;<br/> have been a rag-robe wearer<br/> and have commended rag-robe wearing;<br/> have been a three-garment man<br/> and have commended the triple-raiment;<br/> have wanted little<br/> and have commended few wants;<br/> have been contented<br/> and have commended contentment;<br/> have dwelt in seclusion<br/> and have commended seclusion;<br/> have held aloof from society<br/> and have commended such aloofness;<br/> have lived in strenuous energy<br/> and have commended strenuous energy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Discerning two advantages, lord,<br/> have I for many a day<br/> <br/> been a forest dweller<br/> and have commended forest life;<br/> have been an almsman<br/> and have commended alms-living;<br/> have been a rag-robe wearer<br/> and have commended rag-robe wearing;<br/> have been a three-garment man<br/> and have commended the triple-raiment;<br/> have wanted little<br/> and have commended few wants;<br/> have been contented<br/> and have commended contentment;<br/> have dwelt in seclusion<br/> and have commended seclusion;<br/> have held aloof from society<br/> and have commended such aloofness;<br/> have lived in strenuous energy<br/> and have commended strenuous energy:</p>

    <p class="f4">Discerning mine own present happiness<br/> and being filled with compassion<br/> for them who will come after us.</p>

    <p class="f4">For surely these may fall into error.</p>

    <p class="f4">But let them say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'They who were disciples of the Buddha<br/> and of the followers of the Buddha<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> were for many a day<br/> forest dwellers<br/> and commended forest life;<br/> they were almsmen<br/> and commended alms-living;<br/> they were rag-robe wearers<br/> and commended rag-robe wearing;<br/> they were three-garment men<br/> and commended the triple-raiment;<br/> they were of few wants<br/> and commended few wants;<br/> they were contented<br/> and commended contentment;<br/> they dwelt in seclusion<br/> and commended seclusion;<br/> they held aloof from society<br/> and commended such aloofness;<br/> they lived in strenuous energy,<br/> and they commended strenuous energy,'|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">So saying they will practise that<br/> so they <span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span> may attain this end.</p>

    <p class="f4">This for many a day<br/> will be for their good<br/> and for their happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the two advantages, lord,<br/> the which discerning<br/> I have for many a day<br/> lived on this wise."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, well said, Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the good of many,<br/> truly, hast thou thus practised,<br/> for the happiness of many folk,<br/> out of compassion for the world,<br/> for the salvation,<br/> the good,<br/> the happiness<br/> of devas and of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, Kassapa,<br/> wear thou thy coarse rag-robes<br/> that are past wearing,<br/> go thy rounds for alms<br/> and dwell in the forest."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
