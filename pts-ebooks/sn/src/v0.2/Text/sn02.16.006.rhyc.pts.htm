    <p><span class="f2">[203]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was at Rājagaha<br/> at the Bamboo Grove:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Kassapa came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him,<br/> and sat down at his side.</p>

    <p class="f4">To him so seated<br/> the Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Exhort the brethren, Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Give them discourse on doctrine, Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Either I, Kassapa, or thou<br/> must exhort the brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Either I or thou<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> must give them discourse on doctrine."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just now, lord,<br/> it is difficult to speak to<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are in a state<br/> that makes it difficult to speak to them.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are intractable,<br/> they pay no deference to instruction.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">For instance, lord,<br/> I saw Bhaṇḍa,<br/> the brother who is the colleague of Ānanda,<br/> and Abhiñjika,<br/> who is the colleague of Anuruddha<br/> out-talking each other thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br/> which will speak the more?<br/> which will speak the better?<br/> which will speak the longer?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed a brother:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come thou, brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">tell my word to Bhaṇḍa,<br/> the brother who dwelleth with Ānanda<br/> and Abhiñjika,<br/> the brother who dwelleth with Anuruddha:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Master would speak to you."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[138]</b></span> 'Even so, lord,'<br/> responded that brother,<br/> and he went into the presence of Bhaṇḍa,<br/> the brother who dwelleth with Ānanda<br/> and Abhiñjika,<br/> the brother who dwelleth with Anuruddha and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Master, friends, would speak to you."</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, friend", they responded and they went into the presence of the Exalted one. Having come into the presence of the Exalted one<br/> they saluted him,<br/> and sat down down beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4">To them thus seated<br/> the Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is it true what they say, brethren,<br/> that ye have been out-talking each other thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br/> which will speak the more?<br/> which will speak the better?<br/> which will speak the longer?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye affirm, brethren, that I have been teaching you to out-talk each other in this way:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br/> which will speak the more?<br/> which will speak the better?<br/> which will speak the longer?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"If as ye say, brethren, ye do not affirm that I have been teaching you thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br/> which will speak the more?<br/> which will speak the better?<br/> which will speak the longer?',</p>

    <p class="f4">whatever then,<br/> futile men that ye are,<br/> have ye come to know,<br/> have ye come to see,<br/> in a Doctrine and a Discipline so well declared,<br/> wherein ye are in orders,<br/> that ye should be out-talking each other<br/> as to what ye have learnt,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br/> which will speak the more?<br/> which will speak the better?<br/> which will speak the longer?'".</p>

    <p class="f4">Then those brethren,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> falling prone at the feet of the Exalted One,<br/> spake thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Transgression hath overcome us, lord,<br/> so foolish,<br/> so stupid,<br/> so wrong were we,<br/> in that we,<br/> who are in orders<br/> under a Doctrine and Discipline so well declared,<br/> did out-talk one another therein, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br/> which will speak the more?<br/> which will speak the better?<br/> which will speak the longer.'.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept<br/> this our confession, lord,<br/> for restraint in the future."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Verily, brethren, hath transgression overcome you,<br/> so foolish,<br/> so stupid,<br/> so wrong were ye<br/> in that ye, who are in orders<br/> under a Doctrine and Discipline so well declared,<br/> did out-talk each other, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br/> which will speak the more?<br/> which will speak the better?<br/> which will speak the longer.'.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as ye, brethren,<br/> have seen your transgression as transgression,<br/> and have made confession,<br/> as is right,<br/> we do accept this from you.</p>

    <p class="f4">For this, brethren, it is to grow in the Ariyan Discipline,<br/> when having <span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span> seen transgression as transgression we make confession as is right, and in future practise self-restraint/</p>
