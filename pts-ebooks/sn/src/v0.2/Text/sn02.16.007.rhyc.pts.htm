    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was at Rājagaha<br/> at the Bamboo Grove:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Kassapa came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him,<br/> and sat down at his side.</p>

    <p class="f4">To him so seated<br/> the Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Exhort the brethren, Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Give them discourse on doctrine, Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Either I, Kassapa, or thou<br/> must exhort the brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Either I or thou<br/> must give them discourse on doctrine."</p>
