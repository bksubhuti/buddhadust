    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[208]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was at Rājagaha<br/> at the Bamboo Grove:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Kassapa came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him,<br/> and sat down at his side.</p>

    <p class="f4">To him so seated<br/> the Exalted One said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Exhort the brethren, Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Give them discourse on doctrine, Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Either I, Kassapa, or thou<br/> must exhort the brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Either I or thou<br/> must give them discourse on doctrine."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just now, lord,<br/> it is difficult to speak to the brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just now, lord, it is difficult to speak to the brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are in a state that makes it difficult to speak to them.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are intractable; they pay no deference to instruction."</p>

    <p class="f4">Yea, Kassapa, there was a time<br/> when the senior brethren were forest dwellers<br/> and commenders of the forest life,<br/> almsmen were they<br/> and they commended going for alms,<br/> rag-robe wearers were they<br/> and they commended rag-robe wearing,<br/> three-garment men were they<br/> and they commended the triple-raiment;<br/> of little wants were they,<br/> and they commended few wants;<br/> contented were they,<br/> and they commended contentment;<br/> secluded were they,<br/> and they commended seclusion;<br/> aloof from society were they,<br/> and they commended such aloofness;<br/> strenuous in energy were they,<br/> and they commended such strenuous energy.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brother who was a forest dweller<br/> and commender of the forest life,<br/> almsman<br/> and commendeder of going for alms,<br/> rag-robe wearer<br/> and commendeder of rag-robe wearing,<br/> three-garment man<br/> and commendeder of the triple-raiment;<br/> of little wants,<br/> and commendeder of few wants;<br/> contented,<br/> and commendeder of contentment;<br/> secluded,<br/> and commendeder of seclusion;<br/> aloof from society,<br/> and commendeder of such aloofness;<br/> strenuous in energy,<br/> and commendeder of such strenuous energy,<br/> the senior brethren would invite to a seat,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Who may this brother be?</p>

    <p class="f4">Welcome indeed is this brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Anxious to learn truly is this brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Come, brother, take this seat.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, Kassapa, the novice <span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span> who was a forest dweller<br/> and commender of the forest life,<br/> almsman<br/> and commendeder of going for alms,<br/> rag-robe wearer<br/> and commendeder of rag-robe wearing,<br/> three-garment man<br/> and commendeder of the triple-raiment;<br/> of little wants,<br/> and commendeder of few wants;<br/> contented,<br/> and commendeder of contentment;<br/> secluded,<br/> and commendeder of seclusion;<br/> aloof from society,<br/> and commendeder of such aloofness;<br/> strenuous in energy,<br/> and commendeder of such strenuous energy,<br/> the senior brethren would invite to a seat,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Who may this brother be?</p>

    <p class="f4">Welcome indeed is this brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Anxious to learn truly is this brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Come, brother, take this seat.'</p>

    <p class="f4">They practised that they might so attain;<br/> that made for many a day<br/> for their good,<br/> for their happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">But now, Kassapa, the senior brethren<br/> are neither forest dwellers,<br/> nor do they commend forest life;<br/> they are neither almsmen,<br/> nor do they commend going for alms;<br/> they are neither rag-robe men,<br/> nor do they commend rag-robe wearing;<br/> they are neither three-garment men,<br/> nor do they commend the triple-raiment;<br/> they are neither of little wants,<br/> nor do they commend few wants;<br/> they are neither contented,<br/> nor do they commend contentment;<br/> they are neither secluded,<br/> nor do they commend seclusion;<br/> they are neither aloof from society,<br/> nor do they commend such aloofness;<br/> they are neither strenuous in energy,<br/> nor do they commend such strenuous energy.</p>

    <p class="f4">So it is that the brother who is known,<br/> is of repute,<br/> one who gets presents of raiment,<br/> alms,<br/> lodging<br/> and medical requisites -<br/> him it is that the senior brethren invite to a seat,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Who may this brother be?</p>

    <p class="f4">Welcome indeed is this brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Anxious to learn truly is this brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Come, brother, take this seat.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So it is, Kassapa, the novice who is known,<br/> is of repute,<br/> one who gets presents of raiment,<br/> alms,<br/> lodging<br/> and medical requisites -<br/> him it is that the senior brethren invite to a seat,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Who may this brother be?</p>

    <p class="f4">Welcome indeed is this brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Anxious to learn truly is this brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Come, brother, take this seat.'</p>

    <p class="f4">They practise that they may so attain.</p>

    <p class="f4">That makes for many a day<br/> for their hurt<br/> and for their sorrow.</p>

    <p class="f4">If anyone, Kassapa, were to say,</p>

    <p class="f4">'They who lead the religious life<br/> are harassed by its own dangers;<br/> they who lead the religious life<br/> are fighters of that which assails it,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> he would thereby be saying that which is right.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="demi"/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> See <i>*brahmacārī.</i> The dangers 'within the fold,' B. explains, are excessive desire for material comforts.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><i>*brahmacārī.</i> The inflexions in this sentence are puzzling. One would think the text should read <i>'upaddutā brahmacārino ... abhibhūta brahmacārino.</i> The printed S. text of the <i>Comy.</i> says, that Burmese texts read <i>abhitthanā</i> for <i>abhibhavanā.</i> This does not help. p. 141.</p>
