    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Mahā-Kassapa and the venerable Sāriputta<br/> were once staying at Benares,<br/> at Isipatana in the Deer Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Sāriputta<br/> rising at eventide from meditation<br/> came to Mahā-Kassapa,<br/> greeted him with courtesy and friendly words<br/> and sat down beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How is it, friend Kassapa,<br/> does a Tathāgata<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> come to be after death?</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Exalted One, friend,<br/> has not declared that it is so.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'But, friend, does a Tathāgata<br/> not come to be after death?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span> 'Neither has the Exalted One, friend,<br/> declared that this is so.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well then, friend, does a Tathāgata<br/> both come to be and also not come to be after death?</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Exalted One, friend,<br/> has not declared that it is so.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well then, friend, does a Tathāgata<br/> neither come to be nor not come to be after death?</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Exalted One, friend,<br/> has not declared that it is so.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Why, friend, has the Exalted One<br/> not declared this?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Because this, friend,<br/> doth not pertain to our good,<br/> it belongs not to the first principles of the divine life,<br/> it doth not conduce to repulsion,<br/> to fading away,<br/> to ceasing,<br/> to quiet,<br/> to super-knowledge,<br/> to enlightenment,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore is it undeclared by the Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come then, friend,<br/> what hath the Exalted One declared?</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill -<br/> so, friend, hath the Exalted One declared.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the uprising of ill -<br/> so hath the Exalted One declared.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of ill -<br/> so hath the Exalted One declared.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the way going to the ceasing of ill -<br/> so hath the Exalted One declared.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'And why, friend,<br/> hath the Exalted One declared this?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Because this, friend,<br/> pertaineth to our good,<br/> it belongs to the first principles of the divine life,<br/> it conduces to repulsion,<br/> to fading away,<br/> to ceasing,<br/> to quiet,<br/> to super-knowledge,<br/> to enlightenment,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore it is declared by the Exalted One.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> It is interesting that B. paraphrases <i>Tathāgato</i> by <i>satto,</i> 'being,' as if it were a question of the survival of any individual. The doctrine leaves no doubt about the survival of any one except of an Arahant. That is left in mystery.</p>
