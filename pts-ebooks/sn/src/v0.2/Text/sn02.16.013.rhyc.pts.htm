    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard: —</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Sāvatthī, at the Jeta Grove,<br/> in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Kassapa went into his presence,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, the venerable Maha-Kassapa said this to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">'What now, lord, are the conditions,<br/> what is the cause<br/> that formerly there were both fewer precepts<br/> and more brethren were established as Arahants?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What, lord, are the conditions, <span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span> <br/> what is the cause<br/> that now-a-days there are more precepts<br/> and fewer brethren are established as Arahants?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It happens thus, Kassapa.</p>

    <p class="f4">When members<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> decrease,<br/> and the true doctrine disappears,<br/> there are then more precepts,<br/> and few brethren are established as Arahants.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no disappearing of the true doctrine, Kassapa,<br/> till a counterfeit doctrine arises in the world;<br/> but when a counterfeit doctrine does arise,<br/> then there is a disappearance of the true doctrine.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as there is no disappearing of gold<br/> so long as there is no counterfeit gold arisen in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">So it is with the true doctrine.</p>

    <p class="f4">'The earth-element, Kassapa, does not make the true doctrine disappear,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> nor does the water-element,<br/> nor the heat-element,<br/> nor the air-element.</p>

    <p class="f4">But here in the Order itself futile<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> men arise,<br/> and it is they who make the true doctrine disappear.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Take the sinking of a ship, Kassapa,<br/> by overlading:<br/> it is not thus that the true doctrine disappears.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are five lowering things<br/> that conduce to the obscuration and disappearance<br/> of the true doctrine.</p>

    <p class="f4">Which five?</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is when brethren and sisters,<br/> laymen and laywomen<br/> live in irreverence and are unruly toward the Teacher,<br/> live in irreverence and are unruly toward the Norm,<br/> live in irreverence and are unruly toward the Order,<br/> live in irreverence and are unruly toward the training,<br/> live in irreverence and are unruly toward concentrative study.</p>

    <p class="f4">'But when they live in reverence and docility toward these Five,<br/> then do these five things conduce to the maintenance,<br/> the clarity,<br/> the presence of the true doctrine.'</p>
