    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Dāruṇo.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> explains papatā as a dart encased in a coiled sheath of twine, to be hurled by hand.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Luddakena,</i> lit. 'hunter-ish (thing).' The Burmese read <i>suttakena,</i> 'by this cord': — easier, but not therefore more plausible.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Eḷakā,</i> not as in Childers <i>eḷikā</i>.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> gives, as clue to the elliptical Pali, that a thunderbolt destroys one life-span only, but gains, etc., bring a man to infinitely prolonged misery hereafter.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> The title should read <i>diddhaṅ,</i> with the <i>Comy.</i> This accepts the inclusion of <i>visallena: — visamakkhitena sallena, sattiyā.</i> But it should surely read visa-sallena?</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> A disease, says B., arising during the winter. The fur falls off; he shivers; sores produced by cold winds pain him; he reels about seeking respite like a man bitten by a mad dog.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> On <i>nikkha</i> and <i>singi</i> (nugget), <i>cf.</i> my <i>'Early Economic Conditions of North India'</i> <i>JRAS,</i> 1901, p. 877 <i>f.;</i> Gooneratne's <i>Aṅguttara Nikāya,</i> p. 235, n. 1 <i>f.</i> (Galle, 1913).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> The following ten are all referred to Sāvaṭṭhī.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> This and the following three pairs of followers are also grouped for similar admonition in <i>Aṅguttara</i> i, 88 f.; <i>cf.</i> also <i>ib.</i> i, 23-6; Nanda's mother is there called Uttarā. <i>Kindred Sayings</i> XLI is devoted to Citta. (pron. Chitta). Nanda may be the half-brother of Gotama who became a Thera. (<i>Vin. Texts,</i> i, 210; <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 126; <i>Buddhist Birth Stories,</i> p. 128).</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> Lit. scales (talā), or weights.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Pss. of the Sisters,</i> pp. 81 f. and 111 f.; <i>S.</i> iv. 374 f.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> Trans. 'misery' in Chapter XIV. See <i>ib.,</i> §§ 37-39.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> The syntax of this sentence seems to me corrupt, even if the drift of it be clear. According to the <i>Comy.</i> 'happiness in this present life' applies to the religious circle of whom the earnest man is a member.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a></sup> The following four Suttas are of Sāvaṭṭhī.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a></sup> Namely, <i>alobha, adosa, amoha. Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a></sup> The mule is not able to bring forth, and has to be slain to effect parturition. <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a></sup> = above, i, 192.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a></sup> One such pan containing food for ten men. <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a></sup> <i>Pittaṅ: — acchapittaṅ vā macchapittaṅ vā</i> (of a bear or a fish). Comy.</p>
