    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Rahula came into the presence of the Exalted One, saluted him and eat down beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the venerable Rahula said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One were to teach me a doctrine which,<br/> having heard,<br/> I might live alone,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent,<br/> and aspiring."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What think you as to this, Rahula?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is what you see abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Are sounds<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Are scents abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Are savours abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Are tactile contacts abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Are mental objects abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, Rahula,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by sight,<br/> is repelled by hearing,<br/> is repelled by smelling,<br/> is repelled by tast,<br/> is repelled by touch,<br/> is repelled by mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled,<br/> he loses desire for it;<br/> from losing desire<br/> he is set free;<br/> concerning that which is free,<br/> knowledge comes to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am free!</p>

    <p class="f4">Perished is birth,<br/> lived is the divine life,<br/> done what was to be done,<br/> there is nothing more in this state!' -<br/> thus he knows."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Mrs. Rhys Davids abridges after 'what you see'. Following that the result would be 'what you hear', etc. But the Pali is 'forms, sounds, scents, tastes, touches, dhammas ('things' otherwise translated as 'mental objects,' 'thoughts').' which I have used in the following.</p>
