    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Rahula came into the presence of the Exalted One, saluted him and eat down beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the Exalted One said this to the venerable Rahula:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What think you as to this, Rahula?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is sight abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Is hearing abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Is smelling abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Is taste abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Is touch abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Is mind abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, Rahula,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by sight,<br/> is repelled by hearing,<br/> is repelled by smelling,<br/> is repelled by tast,<br/> is repelled by touch,<br/> is repelled by mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled,<br/> he loses desire for it;<br/> from losing desire<br/> he is set free;<br/> concerning that which is free,<br/> knowledge comes to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am free!</p>

    <p class="f4">Perished is birth,<br/> lived is the divine life,<br/> done what was to be done,<br/> there is nothing more in this state!' -<br/> thus he knows."</p>
