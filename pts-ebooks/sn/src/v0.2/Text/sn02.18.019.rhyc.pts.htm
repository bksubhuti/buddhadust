    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Rahula came into the presence of the Exalted One, saluted him and eat down beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the Exalted One said this to the venerable Rahula:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What think you as to this, Rahula?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is the earthy element abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the watery element abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the fiery element abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the mobile<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> element abiding or fleeting?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/> unhappy,<br/> changeable -<br/> is it fit to consider that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is mine!</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my spirit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, Rahula,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by sight,<br/> is repelled by hearing,<br/> is repelled by smelling,<br/> is repelled by tast,<br/> is repelled by touch,<br/> is repelled by mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled,<br/> he loses desire for it;<br/> from losing desire<br/> he is set free;<br/> concerning that which is free,<br/> knowledge comes to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am free!</p>

    <p class="f4">Perished is birth,<br/> lived is the divine life,<br/> done what was to be done,<br/> there is nothing more in this state!' -<br/> thus he knows."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Mrs. Rhys Davids translations of 'vāyo' are "mobile and aerial", and here 'aerial' would better follow in style, but 'air' is an incorrect translation where mobile comes closer to the correct 'windy' or better 'wind'.</p>
