    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Rājagaha<br/> in the Bamboo Grove<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Lakkhana<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> and the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/> were staying at Vulture's Peak hill.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/> rising at an early hour<br/> and taking bowl and robe<br/> went to see the venerable Lakkhana<br/> and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let us go, friend Lakkhana,<br/> and enter Rājagaha for alms.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Lakkhana consented.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/> as he was descending the hill<br/> and passing a certain place<br/> smiled.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Lakkhana said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What is the reason,<br/> what is the cause, friend Moggallāna,<br/> that you smile?</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is not the right time for that question, friend Lakkhana.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ask me the question in the Exalted One's presence.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then when the twain had made their alms-round in Rājagaha,<br/> had dined<br/> and come away from their meal,<br/> they went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and took their seat beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Lakkhana said to Mahā-Moggallāna:-</p>

    <p class="f4">'As the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna was descending Vulture's Peak hill just now,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span> as he came to a certain place<br/> he smiled:-</p>

    <p class="f4">What was the reason,<br/> what was the cause for the smile?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Just now, friend,<br/> as I was descending Vulture's Peak hill,<br/> I saw a skeleton<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> going through the air,<br/> and vultures,<br/> crows<br/> and falcons<br/> kept flying after it,<br/> pecking at<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> its ribs,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> pulling it apart<br/> while it<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> uttered cries of pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me, friend, came this thought:-</p>

    <p class="f4">"0 but this is wonderful!</p>

    <p class="f4">0 but this is marvellous<br/> that a person will come to have such a shape,<br/> that the individuality acquired<br/> will come to have such a shape!"'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Disciples, brethren, live the life of vision,<br/> yea, of insight,<br/> since a disciple will know,<br/> or will see,<br/> or will testify<br/> to a thing like this.</p>

    <p class="f4">I also, brethren, had seen that being before now,<br/> yet I did not reveal it.</p>

    <p class="f4">I might have revealed it,<br/> and others would not have believed me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Had they not believed me,<br/> it would have been to their hurt and their sorrow.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This being, brethren,<br/> was a cattle-butcher<br/> in this very Rājagaha.</p>

    <p class="f4">He by the effect of that work<br/> has been punished<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> for many years,<br/> for many hundreds,<br/> nay, hundred thousands of years<br/> in purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now by the remaining effect of that work<br/> he has acquired a personality of that kind.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This was a thera, one of the 1,000 Jaṭilas ordained by the Buddha when the three famous Kassapas were converted by him (<i>Vin. Texts</i> i, 132-5), and he had preached the 'Burning' Sermon; a very worthy saint. <i>Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> The comment on the vision may thus be summarized:- The skeleton was a Peta. He and the birds, not being earth-dwellers, could only be seen clairvoyantly. They would not come into the focus of the earthly eye <i>(pasāda-cakkhu)</i>. M.-M. should have felt pity - why did he smile? He thought of how the Buddha's wisdom and he too had prevailed, so that never could he come again to such a state. His exclamations were prompted by pity. Lakkhana could also have seen the vision, but he was not attending as a clairvoyant must.</p>
