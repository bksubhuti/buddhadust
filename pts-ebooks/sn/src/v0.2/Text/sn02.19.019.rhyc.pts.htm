    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Lakkhana and the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna were staying at Vulture's Peak hill.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna rising at an early hour<br/> and taking bowl and robe<br/> went to see the venerable Lakkhana and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let us go, friend Lakkhana,<br/> and enter Rājagaha for alms.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Lakkhana consented.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/> as he was descending the hill<br/> and passing a certain place<br/> smiled.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Lakkhana said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What is the reason,<br/> what is the cause, friend Moggallāna,<br/> that you smile?</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is not the right time for that question, friend Lakkhana.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ask me the question in the Exalted One's presence.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then when the twain had made their alms-round in Rājagaha,<br/> had dined<br/> and come away from their meal,<br/> they went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and took their seat beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Lakkhana said to Mahā-Moggallāna:-</p>

    <p class="f4">'As the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna was descending Vulture's Peak hill just now,<br/> as he came to a certain place<br/> he smiled:-</p>

    <p class="f4">What was the reason,<br/> what was the cause for the smile?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Just now, friend,<br/> as I was descending Vulture's Peak hill,<br/> I saw a sister-in-training going through the air,<br/> her under-robe was on fire, burning and blazing,<br/> her bowl was on fire, burning and blazing,<br/> her girdle was on fire, burning and blazing,<br/> her body was on fire, burning and blazing,<br/> and she was uttering cries of distress.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me, friend, came this thought:-</p>

    <p class="f4">"0 but this is wonderful!</p>

    <p class="f4">0 but this is marvellous<br/> that a person will come to have such a shape,<br/> that the individuality acquired<br/> will come to have such a shape!"'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Disciples, brethren, live the life of vision,<br/> yea, of insight,<br/> since a disciple will know,<br/> or will see,<br/> or will testify<br/> to a thing like this.</p>

    <p class="f4">I also, brethren, had seen that sister-in-training before now,<br/> yet I did not reveal it.</p>

    <p class="f4">I might have revealed it,<br/> and others would not have believed me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Had they not believed me,<br/> it would have been to their hurt and their sorrow.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This alms-woman, brethren,<br/> was an evil-living sister-in-training<br/> when Kassapa Buddha was teaching.</p>

    <p class="f4">She by the effect of that work<br/> has been punished for many years,<br/> for many hundreds,<br/> nay, hundred thousands of years<br/> in purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now by the remaining effect of that work<br/> she has acquired a personality<br/> of that kind.'</p>
