    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, lifting up a little sand on the tip of his finger-nail, addressed the brethren:-</p>

    <p class="f4">'As to this what think ye, brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Which is greater,<br/> this little sand lifted on my finger-nail,<br/> or this great earth?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This lord, is greater,<br/> even this great earth.</p>

    <p class="f4">A trifle is the little sand lifted by the Exalted One on to his finger-nail.</p>

    <p class="f4">It cannot come into reckoning,<br/> it cannot come into comparison,<br/> it cannot form a fraction<br/> when compared with the great earth —<br/> this little sand lifted by the Exalted One on to his finger-nail.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, brethren,<br/> are the beings that are reborn among humans<br/> few in number as against the greater number<br/> that are reborn elsewhere<br/> and not among humans.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'Wherefore, brethren,<br/> thus must ye train yourselves:­</p>

    <p class="f4">"We will live earnestly"<br/> - even thus.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Cf. above p.95 [SN 2.13.1]</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Somewhat arbitrarily the commentarial tradition judges that the greater alternative includes only rebirth in the four woeful spheres: — purgatory, animals, asuras and petas, deva-rebirth being included under the former alternative.</p>
