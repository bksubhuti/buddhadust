    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as whatever clans have many women,<br/> few men,<br/> are easily molested by robbers and pot-thieves,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> even so, brethren,<br/> any brother who has not developed<br/> and often practised<br/> liberation of will through love<br/> is easily molested by beings other than human.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as whatever clans have few women,<br/> many men,<br/> are hard to molest by robbers and pot-thieves,<br/> even so any brother who has developed<br/> and often practised<br/> liberation of will through love<br/> is hardly molested by beings other than human.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren, thus must ye train yourselves:­</p>

    <p class="f4">Liberation of the will through love we will develop,<br/> we will often practise it,<br/> make it a vehicle,<br/> make it a base,<br/> take our stand upon it,<br/> store it up,<br/> thoroughly set it going.</p>
