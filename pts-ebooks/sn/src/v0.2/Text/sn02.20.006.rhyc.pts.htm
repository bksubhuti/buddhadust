    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the Exalted One addressed the brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, brethren, there were four archers mighty with the bow, well trained, expert, past masters in their art and a man were to come saying: "I will catch and bring the shafts let fly by these four archers mighty with the bow ... or ever they reach the ground."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>As to that what think ye, brethren?<br/> Were this enough for him to be called a swift man possessed of supreme speed?'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>'Even, lord, if he caught and brought the shafts let fly by only one of the four archers mighty with the bow ... or ever they reached the ground, it were enough for him to be called a swift man possessed of supreme speed. What need to speak of four such bowmen?'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Brethren, as is the speed of that man, as is the speed of moon and sun, swifter than he, as is the speed of those spirits who run ahead<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> of moon and sun swifter than he, swifter than them both, so swifter than even these is the passing away of the things of this life.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Wherefore, brethren, thus must ye train yourselves: "We will live earnestly" — even thus.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>
