    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the Exalted One addressed the brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, brethren, the Dasārahas had a kettle­drum called Summoner.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">As it began to split the Dasārahas fixed in ever another peg, until the time came that the Summoner's original drumhead had vanished and only the framework of pegs remained.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span> Even so, brethren, will the brethren become in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Those Suttantas uttered by the Tathāgata, deep, deep in meaning, not of the world, dealing with the void, to these when uttered, they will not listen, they will not lend a ready ear, they will not bring to them an understanding heart, they will not deem those doctrines that which should be learnt by heart, that which should be mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">But those Suttantas which are made by poets, which are poetry, which are a manifold of words, a manifold of phrases, alien, the utterances of disciples, to these when uttered they will listen, they will lend a ready ear, they will bring an understanding heart, they will deem these doctrines that which should be learnt by heart, which should be mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is, brethren, that the Suttantas uttered by the Tathāgata, deep, deep in meaning, not of the world, dealing with the void, will disappear.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren, ye are thus to train yourselves :-</p>

    <p class="f4">To these very Suttantas will we listen, will we give a ready ear, to these will we bring an understanding heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">And we will deem these doctrines that which should be learnt by heart, and mastered:<br/> - even thus.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Ānaka</i> or <i>āṇaka,</i> so explained by the <i>Comy.</i>. 'As if summoning the people, it brought them together.' Summoning by drum is mentioned in <i>Jāt.</i> ii, 70 (No. 186); iv, 171 (No. 483), 256. On the name see <i>Jātaka</i> ii, p. 237 (No. 499) (No. 267), where the allusion looks like a gloss.</p>
