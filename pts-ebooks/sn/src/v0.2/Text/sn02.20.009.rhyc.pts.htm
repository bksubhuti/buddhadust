    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time a certain novice spent too much time among the clansmen's houses.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the brethren admonished him not to do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">He being spoken to said thus:-</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily these senior brethren deem it permissible to go about among the clansmen's houses;<br/> why then should not I?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then many of the brethren went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him and sat down beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated they told him of this.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, brethren,<br/> there was a great lake in a wooded region,<br/> and elephants dwelt by it.</p>

    <p class="f4">They, plunging into the lake,<br/> plucked up stalks and root-fibres of lotuses,<br/> cleansed them well,<br/> worked them free from mud and swallowed them.</p>

    <p class="f4">This made in them<br/> for beauty and strength;<br/> there was naught therein<br/> whence they should suffer death or mortal pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">But following the example of those great elephants<br/> tender baby-elephants<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> plunged into the lake,<br/> plucked up stalks and <span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span> root-fibres of lotuses,<br/> and swallowed them not cleansed,<br/> and kneaded together all muddy.</p>

    <p class="f4">This made in them<br/> neither for beauty nor for strength;<br/> there was herein whence<br/> they came to suffer death or mortal pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren,<br/> with us when the senior brethren rise at an early hour<br/> and taking bowl and robe<br/> enter village or township for alms,<br/> there they utter the doctrine<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> the laymen pleased with them do their duty.</p>

    <p class="f4">They enjoy what they get<br/> without greed or longing,<br/> void of offence,<br/> watchful of danger<br/> and discerning their salvation.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus these things make in them<br/> for beauty and strength;<br/> there is naught therein<br/> whence they should come to death<br/> or to mortal pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">But novices, when they,<br/> following the training of the senior brethren,<br/> rise at an early hour,<br/> and taking bowl and enter village or town for alms,<br/> there they utter the doctrine.</p>

    <p class="f4">The laity pleased with them do their duty.</p>

    <p class="f4">The novices enjoy what they get<br/> greedily and with longing,<br/> committing offence,<br/> heedless of danger<br/> and undiscerning their salvation.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus these things do not make in them<br/> for beauty or strength;<br/> for that reason they come to death<br/> or to mortal pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren,<br/> thus must ye train yourselves: -</p>

    <p class="f4">'We will enjoy what we get<br/> without greed,<br/> or longing,<br/> or offence,<br/> watchful of danger,<br/> discerning our salvation'<br/> ­ even thus.</p>
