    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time a certain brother spent too much time among the clansmen's houses.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the brethren admonished him not to spend too much time over such intercourse.</p>

    <p class="f4">That brother being spoken to by them did not desist.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then many of them went and told the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, brethren,<br/> a cat was standing<br/> on the refuse-heap of a house-sewer,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> watching for a mouse,<br/> thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'When this mouse will come out of her home,<br/> I shall then and there catch and eat her.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And that mouse did come out of her home,<br/> and the cat pounced violently on her,<br/> disposed of her,<br/> swallowed her.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the mouse gnawed his guts,<br/> gnawed his bowels,<br/> thence he came to death<br/> or to mortal pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren, with us<br/> when a brother rising betimes<br/> and taking bowl and robe<br/> enters the village or township for alms,<br/> unguarded in deed,<br/> word<br/> and thought,<br/> without calling up self-possession,<br/> without self-restraint,<br/> it happens that there he sees womenfolk<br/> thinly clad<br/> or slightly clad.</p>

    <p class="f4">And seeing them<br/> lust begins to assail his heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whereby he comes to death<br/> or to mortal pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">For this, brethren,<br/> is death in the discipline of the Ariyan ­<br/> that a man reject the training<br/> and turn away to the low things.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren,<br/> is mortal pain -<br/> that he incur some dire offence,<br/> an offence, that is,<br/> whence recovery is declared possible.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren,<br/> thus must ye train yourselves:­</p>

    <p class="f4">'Only with guarded deed,<br/> word<br/> and thought,<br/> calling up self-possession,<br/> and self-restraint<br/> will we enter village or township for alms'<br/> —even thus.</p>
