    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.<br/> There he addressed the brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Have ye heard the jackal, brethren,<br/> howling in the night,<br/> at dawn?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'That will be an old jackal, brethren,<br/> afflicted by mange.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherever he wishes to go,<br/> to stand,<br/> to sit,<br/> to lie,<br/> there he goes,<br/> he stands,<br/> he sits,<br/> he lies,<br/> and the cold wind blows on him.</p>

    <p class="f4">It may be, brethren,<br/> that there is in that decrepit old jackal<br/> more thankfulness,<br/> more gratitude<br/> than there is in a certain man among us<br/> pledged to the Son of the Sakyans.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren,<br/> thus must ye train yourselves:­</p>

    <p class="f4">'We will be thankful and grateful.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not even the least thing that is done for us shall be lost'<br/> -even thus.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="demi"/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> has a tale about the jackal's gratitude. Released by a peasant from a snake coiled about it, the snake thereupon attacked the peasant. The jackal brought the peasant his axe in its mouth.</p>
