    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friends, brethren!'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, friend,' responded the brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta said this: —</p>

    <p class="f4">To me, friends, as I was meditating in seclusion, there arose this consideration: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is there now anything in the whole world, wherein a changing, a becoming otherwise would give rise in me to grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair?'</p>

    <p class="f4">And methought: 'No, there is no such thing.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda said this to the venerable Sāriputta: — 'But the Master, friend Sāriputta — would not a changing, a becoming otherwise in him give rise in you to grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Not even a changing, a becoming otherwise in him, friend Ānanda.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Nevertheless I should [feel] thus: —</p>

    <p class="f4">"O may not the mighty one, O may not the Master so gifted, so wonderful be taken from us! Verily if the Exalted One may abide et a long while with us, out of love to the world, it would be for the weal, the happiness of many many folk, the good, the weal, the happiness of devas and men!"</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely long time have notions of "I" and of "mine" and insidious conceits been rooted out from the venerable Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">On that account is it that for the venerable Sāriputta a changing, a becoming otherwise even in the Master would not give rise to grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="demi"/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Sāriputta's personal name. See <i>Pss. of the Brethren, loc. cit.</i> This and the next four Suttas are all referred to Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> I have ventured to place this sentence in Sāriputta's mouth, changing, in the Feer edition, 'Sāriputta' to Ānanda. It is unlikely S. would have kept silence; moreover, the wish expressed by S. is precisely that which Ā. was later on to utter too late. See <i>Dialogues</i> ii, 111.</p>
