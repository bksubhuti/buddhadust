    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">At this time both the venerable ones Sāriputta and Mahā-Moggallāna were staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the Suirrels' Feeding-ground in the same cell.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta rising at eventide from meditation went to the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna and exchanged kind and friendly greetings with him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated by his side the venerable Sāriputta said thus: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Very serene, friend, Moggallāna, are you looking, very pure and clear is your complexion.</p>

    <p class="f4">Has the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna spent to-day in peace?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'I spent to-day, friend, in the exercise of sense,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> moreover I had pious converse.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'With whom did the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna hold pious converse?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'With the Exalted One, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Far away, friend, the Exalted One now stays at Savatthī, at Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. What then? Did the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna go by will-power to the Exalted one, or was it the other way about?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'I neither went by will-power to the Exalted One, friend, nor did the Exalted One come by will-power to me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nevertheless even as with him, so also with me the deva-sight and the deva-hearing are made clear.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'What kind of pious converse did the Exalted One hold with the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'As to that, friend, I asked the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"We say, lord, [this one] is of consummate energy,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> [that one] is of consummate energy; in what way is a man so?</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One said to me this: —</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is herein, Moggallāna, that a brother practises consummate energy: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'Verily let skin and sinews and bones wilt in my body,<br/> let flesh and blood dry up,<br/> or ever there be halting of energy<br/> till I have won<br/> that which by a man's strength,<br/> by man's energy,<br/> by man's progress<br/> may be won!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> —</p>

    <p class="f4">— thus Moggallāna, does one become of consummate energy."</p>

    <p class="f4">It was just thus that I had pious converse with the Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'As if a little mound of gravel were set up alongside of Himālaya, lord of the hills, friend, even so are we when set up alongside of the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna. Verily may he, so gifted, so wonderful abide here for an aeon if he so desire!'</p>

    <p class="f4">'As if a little pinch of salt were set up alongside of a big jar of salt, friend, even so are we when set up alongside of the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily hath the Exalted One praised, commended, extolled the venerable Sāriputta in divers ways.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Even as Sāriputta was supreme<br/> In insight, morals, and self-mastery,<br/> So may the brother who hath won the goal<br/> Rank even with the highest of them all.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus verily did these two great souls give cheer one to the other in that they spoke well, in that they talked well.</p>
