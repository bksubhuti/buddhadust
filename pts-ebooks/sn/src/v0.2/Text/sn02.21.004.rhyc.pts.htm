    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time a certain novice after he had returned from his alms-round and had dined, entered his cell and sat at leisure, in silence and resigned, nor did he render service to the brethren at the time of robe-making.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of the brethren went and informed the Exalted One of his conduct.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One bade a certain brother:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come thou, brother, bid that brother by my word hither saying, "The Master bids thee, friend."'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord,' was the response, and that brother came, saluted the Exalted One, and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">To him so seated the Exalted One said: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is it true what they say that thou, brother, after alms-round and meal dost sit at leisure, in silence and resigned, nor renderest service to the brethren at the time of robe-making?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'I do my own work, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, reading by his mind that brother's mind, bade the brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Be ye not vexed, brethren, with this brother. He is a brother who can attain at will,<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> who can attain without trouble, without toil the Four Jhānas, happy states, under present conditions, of highest consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> And that for the sake of which the clansmen rightly leave home for the homeless — that uttermost goal of divine living he has come to know thoroughly for himself and to realize, has attained it and therein abides.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this. The Well-farer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">No slacker nor the man of puny strength<br/> May win Nibbāna, freedom from all ill.<br/> And this young brother, yea, this peerless man<br/> Bears the last burden, devil's<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> conqueror.</p>
