    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sujāta came into the presence of the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One saw the venerable Sujāta coming, and seeing him he addressed the brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Truly, brethren, that clansman in both ways is beautiful; not only in that he is gifted with perfect beauty, is very handsome, attractive and lovely, but also in that he has come to know thoroughly for himself and to realize, and so attain to and abide in that uttermost goal of divine living, for the sake of which the clansmen rightly leave home for the homeless.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Well-farer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Fair, I ween, this brother is.<br/> Straight and sincere the heart of him.<br/> Detached, unyoked [from worldly ties],<br/> In grasping not O well is him!<br/> He bears the final body now,<br/> Victor o'er Māra and his mount.</p>
