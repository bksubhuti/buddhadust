    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Vesālī at the Great Grove in the Gabled Hall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Visākha of the Pañcālans<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> was in the meeting-hall instructing, inciting, enlightening, and inspiring the brethren with pious discourse, with urbane speech, well articulated, without hoarseness, expounding the meaning, relevant, unworldly.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, when he had risen from meditation at eventide, went to the meeting-hall and sat down on the seat prepared.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he addressed the brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Who was it, brethren, that was in the meeting-hall instructing, inciting, enlightening, and inspiring the brethren with pious discourse, in urbane speech, well articulated, without hoarseness, expounding the meaning, relevant, unwordly?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It was the venerable Visākha of the Pañcālans, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed Visākha saying: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well done, well done, Visākha! Well hast thou done on this wise to address the brethren.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Well-farer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">They know the wise man mixing with the fools<br/> Though naught he say.<br/> They know him when he speaks, teaching [us all]<br/> The Deathless Way.<br/> Let him speak doctrine, make it shine, lift up<br/> The banner of the seers. Bright shining words<br/> Have they for banner, yea, they have the Norm.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Cf. Pss of the Brethren, p. 152 f.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> This formula for a good delivery occurs above, i, 241, with the last two adjectives omitted. B. discusses the terms as if they occurred here for the first time. He had probably forgotten (as also had the translator, but her collaborator had not). The last two terms, literally 'included, independent,' are explained by the <i>Comy.</i> to mean, 'included in the Four Truths-doctrine,' 'not on themes of <i>saṅsāra.</i>'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Cf. Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 65, <i>n.</i> 3, and references there. It is not easy to reproduce the word-play on <i>bhāsati</i> to speak, and to shine (<i>bhāsay</i> make shine). <i>Cf.</i> above, i, 23, <i>n.</i>1; 67, <i>n.</i>1.</p>
