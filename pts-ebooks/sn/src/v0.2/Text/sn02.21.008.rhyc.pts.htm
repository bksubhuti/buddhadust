    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Nanda, nephew of the Exalted One's mother, donning robes that had been dressed on both sides,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> painting his eyes and taking a bright, clean bowl, went into the presence of the Exalted One, saluted him, and took his seat beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4">To him so seated the Exalted One said: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Not meet is it for thee, Nanda, who as a clansman, left the world in faith, going from home to the homeless, to don robes that have been dressed on both sides, to paint thine eyes and bear about a bright, spotless bowl.</p>

    <p class="f4">Meet for thee, Nanda, is it that thou shouldst be a forest-dweller, an almsman and a ragged robe-man, and that thou shouldst dwell unheeding desires of sense.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Well-farer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Maybe some day shall I see<br/> Nanda a forest-votary,<br/> In gear cast out he knows not whence,<br/> His maintenance supplied<br/> By food he knows as cast aside,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> Heedless to calls of sense.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Nanda after that became a forest-dweller and an almsman, and a rag-robe-man, heedless as to desires of sense.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This method, corresponding possibly to our 'pressing cloth,' is described as rapping with hand or mallet, and again rapping after reversing the cloth. <i>Cf. Dhammapada, Comy.</i> i, 37. On Nanda see <i>Udāna,</i> p. 21, <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 46. B. here states that he 'got himself up' to evoke an opinion from his cousin — either 'truly this little brother of mine is beautiful!' or a fault-finding — that he might dress accordingly for the rest of his life.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> So the <i>Comy.</i> 'marked off when choice food is selected for the great folk.' <i>Cf. Pss. of the Sisters,</i> p. 144, <b>n.</b>1.</p>
