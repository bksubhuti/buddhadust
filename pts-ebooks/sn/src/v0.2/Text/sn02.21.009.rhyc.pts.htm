    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Tissa, nephew to the Exalted One's father,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> went into the presence of the Exalted One, saluted him, and took his seat beside him, unhappy, sorrowful, the tears rolling down.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said this: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'What is it, Tissa, that you sit there unhappy, sorrowful, the tears rolling down?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It's because the brethren, lord, with one accord have been abusing and teasing me.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'That is because, Tissa, thou wilt do the talking, and dost not bear with their talk.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not meet is it for thee, Tissa, a clansman who in faith didst leave the world, the home for the homeless, to be the talker and not suffer the talk of others.</p>

    <p class="f4">Meet it is for such as thee, if thou be the talker, to suffer also that others talk.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Well-farer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Now why be wrath? Nay, Tissa, be not wrath!<br/> To bear no anger, this is best for thee.<br/> Yea, to suppress anger, conceit and guile —<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> For this we live the living that's divine.</p>
