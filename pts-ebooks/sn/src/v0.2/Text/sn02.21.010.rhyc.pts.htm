    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time a certain brother by name Senior<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> was living alone and was commending such a life.</p>

    <p class="f4">He entered the village alone for alms,<br/> he returned alone,<br/> alone he sat in private [meditation]<br/> and alone he practised his terrace-walk.</p>

    <p class="f4">The a number of brethren went into the presence of the Exalted One<br/> and told him of this brother's mode of life.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[5][than]</span>And the Exalted One spoke to a certain brother saying: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come thou, brother,<br/> tell my word to Brother Senior: —<br/> "The Master, friend Senior, calls for thee."'</p>

    <p class="f4">'So be it, lord,' responded the brother, and called the venerable Senior.</p>

    <p class="f4">'So be it, friend,' responded the venerable Senior, and he came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/> <span class="f3">[7][than]</span>saluted him,<br/> and sat down beside him.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[8][than]</span>To him so seated the Exalted One said: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is it true what they say, Senior, that you are living quite alone and commending such a life?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is so, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[9][than]</span>'What sort of life is this that you lead and commend?'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[10][than]</span>'It is this, lord, that I enter the village alone for alms, return alone, sit alone [to meditate], and perform the terrace-walk alone.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[11][than]</span>'That is living alone, Senior; I do not say it is not so. But further, there is a way of perfecting the solitary life in detail which I will tell you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Listen well and give your mind thoroughly.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[12][than]</span>How, Senior, is the solitary life perfected in detail?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is when that which is past is put away; when that which is future is given up, and when, with regard to present self-states that we have got, will and passion have been thoroughly mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is thus, Senior, that the solitary life is perfected in detail.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[13][than]</span>The Exalted One spake this.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Well-farer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Who overcometh all, who understandeth all,<br/> Whoso is very wise, in all things undefiled,<br/> Who all abandoning, in death of craving free,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> That is the man of whom I'd say, 'He lives alone.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Thera</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Craving is sometimes called one's 'second' (<i>alter ego</i> or mate). <i>Cf. Pss. of the Brethren,</i> verse 54, 1091; <i>Majjhima</i> i, 171.</p>
