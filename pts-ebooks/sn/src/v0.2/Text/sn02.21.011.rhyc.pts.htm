    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Kappina<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came into the presence of the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One saw him coming while afar,<br/> and seeing him he called the brethren:—</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do you see, brethren,<br/> that brother coming to us,<br/> pale, thin, with a prominent nose?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'That brother is highly gifted, brethren,<br/> of wondrous power.<br/> No easy matter is it<br/> to win that which he formerly had not won,<br/> even that for the sake of which clansmen<br/> rightly leave the home for the homeless,<br/> even that uttermost goal of the divine living<br/> which he has attained,<br/> wherein he abides,<br/> having come just here and now<br/> to know it thoroughly for himself<br/> and to realize it.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Well-farer so saying,<br/> the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">The noble is the best among the folk<br/> <span class="in1">Who put their trust in lineage.</span><br/> But one in wisdom and in virtue clothed<br/> <span class="in1">Is best of all 'mong spirits and men.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">By day the sun shines and by night the moon.<br/> In armour shines the warrior; ardent, rapt,<br/> The brahmin shines, but through both day and night<br/> Shineth the Buddha's glowing (love for men).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> See <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 254 <i>f.</i> for his story and verses; also p. 366. B. gives the same story here, a somewhat amplified version.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Dialogues</i> iii, 94.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Dhammapada,</i> verse 387; <i>cf.</i> above, i. 22, 67. These are simple ideas in simple Pali. I cannot give the play on words in <i>jhāyi,</i> which means both burning and meditating, save that 'ardent' has an analogous double meaning. 'Glowing love for men' is freely rendered. <i>Tejo</i> also bears a double meaning, like 'ardent.' It means both 'heat' and that efflux of feeling and will for which we have no word as yet, but which Jesus meant by 'virtue,' and we mean by 'vim.'</p>
