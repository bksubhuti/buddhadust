    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now two brethren who were comrades, dwelling together with the venerable Mahā-Kappina, came into the presence of the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One saw them coming yet afar, and seeing them he called to the brethren: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do you see coming to us, brethren, those two comrade-brethren who are dwelling together with Kappina?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Those two, brethren, are highly gifted, of wondrous power.</p>

    <p class="f4">No easy matter is it to win that which they formerly had not won, even that for the sake of which clansmen rightly leave the home for the homeless, even that uttermost goal of the divine living which they have attained, wherein they abide, having come just here and now to know it thoroughly for themselves and to realize it.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Well-farer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Comrades these brethren are for sure.<br/> Long time have they together fared.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> The holy Norm fares on in them,<br/> The Norm that Buddhas tell to men,<br/> The Norm that Ariyans tell to men,<br/> By Kappina therein well trained,<br/> They bear their final body now,<br/> For they are devil-conquerors.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Sameti = saṅsandati,</i> the word rendered 'flow together,' above, p. 108. The legend is that they had been somehow with each other in five hundred previous lives.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Cf. above, pp. 18, 189</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> There is a poetically framed envoi added, by scribe or editor, in the three Singhalese MSS. used by Feer: — Long may the river of the Word of the Conqueror, springing from the rock of him of the ten powers, having the ocean of Nibbāna as its goal, [flowing with] the waters of the passing away, bear [us] on!</p>
