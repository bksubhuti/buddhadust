    <p><span class="f2">[1]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[1]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying among the Bhaggi, at Crocodile-Haunt<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> in Bhesakala.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> Grove in the Deer-Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the house-father Nakulapitar came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat there, the house-father Nakulapitar addressed the Exalted One, saying:—</p>

    <p class="f4">'Master, I am a broken-down old man,<br/> aged, far-gone in years,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> I have reached life's end,<br/> I am sick and always ailing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, Master, I am one<br/> to whom rarely comes the sight<br/> of the Exalted One<br/> and the worshipful brethren.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Let the Exalted One cheer and comfort me,<br/> so that it be a profit and a blessing unto me<br/> for many a long day.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span> True it is, true it is, house-father,<br/> that your body is weak<span class="f3"><sup>5</sup></span> and cumbered.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">For one carrying this' body about, house-father,<br/> to claim but a moment's health<br/> would be sheer foolishness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, house-father,<br/> thus you should train yourself:—<br/> "Though my body is sick,<br/> my mind shall not be sick."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, house-father, must you train yourself.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Nakulapitar, the house-father,<br/> welcomed and gladly heard the words of the Exalted One,<br/> and rising from his seat<br/> he saluted the Exalted One by the right,<br/> and departed.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he came to the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat there,<br/> the venerable Sāriputta said to the house-father Nakulapitar:—</p>

    <p class="f4">'Calmed are your senses, house-father:<br/> clear and pure is your complexion.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> Surely to-day you have had pious converse<br/> face-to-face with the Exalted One?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'How could it be otherwise, Master?<br/> I have just now been sprinkled with the nectar<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> of pious converse by the Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'And in what way, house-father,<br/> were you sprinkled with the nectar<br/> of pious converse by the Exalted One?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, Master, I went to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him, and sat down at one side.<br/> As I sat thus, Master,<br/> I said to the Exalted One:—<br/> "Master, I am a broken-down old man,<br/> aged, far gone in years,<br/> I have reached my life's end,<br/> I am sick and always ailing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, Master, I am one to whom<br/> rarely comes the sight of the Exalted One<br/> and the worshipful brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let the Exalted One cheer and comfort me,<br/> so that it be a profit and a blessing unto me<br/> for many a long day."</p>

    <p class="f4">"True it is, true it is, house-father,<br/> that your body is weak and cumbered.</p>

    <p class="f4">For one carrying this body about, house-father,<br/> to claim but a moment's health<br/> were sheer foolishness.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span> Wherefore, house-father, thus you should train yourself:—</p>

    <p class="f4">'Though my body is sick,<br/> my mind shall not be sick.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, house-father, must you train yourself."'</p>

    <p class="f4">'But did not it occur to you," house-father,<br/> to question the Exalted One further? Thus:<br/> "Pray, how far, Master,<br/> is body sick and mind sick?<br/> And how far is body sick and mind not sick?"'</p>

    <p class="f4">'I would travel far indeed, Master,<br/> to learn from the lips of the venerable Sāriputta<br/> the meaning of this saying.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well for me if the venerable Sāriputta<br/> should think fit to expound to me<br/> the meaning of this saying.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Then listen, house-father;<br/> apply your mind<br/> and give heed to what I shall tell you.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, Master,' said house-father Nakulapitar,<br/> and listened to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta thus spake:—</p>

    <p class="f4">'And how is body sick, house-father,<br/> and mind sick too?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> house-father, the untaught many-folk,<br/> who discern not those who are Ariyans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> who are unskilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who are untrained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who discern not those who are worthy ones,<br/> who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/> untrained in the worthy doctrine<br/> — these regard body as the self,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/> they regard the self as having body,<br/> body as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am the body," say they,<br/> "body is mine,"<br/> and are possessed by this idea;<br/> and so, possessed by this idea,<br/> when body alters and changes,<br/> owing to the unstable and changeful nature of body,<br/> then sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation, and despair arise in them.</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard feeling as the self,<br/> they regard the self as having feeling,<br/> feeling as being the self,<br/> the self as being in feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am feeling;" they say,<br/> " feeling is mine,"<br/> and are possessed by this idea;<br/> and so possessed by this idea,<br/> when feeling alters and changes<br/> owing to the unstable and changeful <span class="f2 g"><b>[4]</b></span> nature of feeling,<br/> then sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation, and despair arise in them.</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard perception as the self,<br/> they regard the self as having perception,<br/> perception as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am perception," they say,<br/> "perception is mine,"<br/> and are possessed by this idea;<br/> and so possessed by this idea,<br/> when perception alters and changes<br/> owing to the unstable and changeful nature of perception,<br/> then sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation, and despair arise in them.</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard the activities as the self,<br/> they regard the self as having activities,<br/> activities as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in the activities,<br/> and are possessed by this idea;<br/> and so possessed by this idea,<br/> when the activities alter and change<br/> owing to the unstable and changeful nature of the activities,<br/> then sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation, and despair arise in them.</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard consciousness as the self,<br/> they regard the self as having consciousness,<br/> consciousness as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am consciousness," they say:<br/> "consciousness is mine,"<br/> and are possessed by this idea;<br/> and so possessed by this idea,<br/> when consciousness alters and changes<br/> owing to the unstable and changeful nature of consciousness,<br/> then sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation, and despair arise in them.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, house-father, is how body is sick<br/> and mind is sick too.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is body sick,<br/> but mind not sick?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span>Herein, house-father, the well-taught Ariyan disciple,<br/> who discerns those that are Ariyans,<br/> who is skilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> well trained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> skilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/> well trained in the worthy doctrine,<br/> regards not body as the self,<br/> regards not the self as having body,<br/> nor body as being in the self,<br/> nor self as being in body.</p>

    <p class="f4">He says not "I am body,"<br/> he says not "body is mine,"<br/> nor is possessed by this idea.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he is not so possessed,<br/> when body alters and changes<br/> owing to the unstable <span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span> and changeful nature of body,<br/> then sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation, and despair<br/> do not arise in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards not feeling as the self,<br/> regards not the self as having feeling,<br/> nor feeling as being in the self,<br/> nor the self as being in feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">He says not "I am feeling,<br/> feeling is mine,"<br/> nor is he possessed by this idea.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he is not so possessed,<br/> when feeling alters and changes<br/> owing to the unstable and changeful nature of feeling,<br/> then sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation, and despair<br/> arise not in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards not perception as the self,<br/> regards not the self as having perception,<br/> nor perception as being in the self,<br/> nor the self as being in perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">He says not "I am perception,<br/> perception is mine,"<br/> nor is he possessed by this idea.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he is not so possessed,<br/> when perception alters and changes<br/> owing to the unstable and changeful nature of perception,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation, and despair<br/> do not arise in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards not the activities as the self,<br/> regards not the self as having activities,<br/> nor the activities as being in the self,<br/> nor the self as being in the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">He says not "I am the activities,<br/> the activities are mine,"<br/> nor is he possessed by this idea.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he is not so possessed,<br/> when the activities alter and change<br/> owing to the unstable and changeful nature of the activities,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair<br/> do not arise in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards not consciousness as the self,<br/> regards not the self as having consciousness,<br/> nor consciousness as being in the self,<br/> nor the self as being in consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">He says not "I am consciousness,<br/> consciousness is mine,"<br/> nor is he possessed by this idea.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he is not so possessed,<br/> when consciousness alters and changes<br/> owing to the unstable and changeful nature of consciousness,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair<br/> do not arise in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, house-father, body is sick,<br/> but mind is not sick.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> and the house-father Nakulapitar was pleased<br/> and welcomed what was said by the venerable Sāriputta.</p>
