    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Kaccāna<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Great was dwelling among the folk of Avanti<br/> at Ospreys' Haunt<br/> on a sheer mountain crag.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the house-father Hāliddikāni came to the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br/> and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the house-father Hāliddikāni thus addressed the venerable Kaccāna the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Master, it was said by the Exalted One<br/> in the eighth chapter in the <i>Questions of Māgandiya</i> —<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Home he abandons: homeless wandering<br/> The sage with village-folk not making ties.<br/> Empty of lusts, showing no preference,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> With no man wageth wordy warfare more.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, Master, how should one regard the full meaning<br/> of this concisely spoken saying<br/> of the Exalted One?'</p>

    <p class="f4">The material element, house-father,<br/> is the home of consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now consciousness,<br/> being lust-tied to the material <span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span> element,<br/> is called "home-haunter."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, house-father, the feeling-element<br/> is the home of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus being lust-tied to the feeling-element,<br/> consciousness is called "home-haunter."</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the perception-element, house-father,<br/> is the home of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus being lust-tied to the perception-element,<br/> consciousness is called "home-haunter."</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the activities-element, house-father,<br/> is the home of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus being lust-tied to the activities element,<br/> consciousness is called "home-haunter."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That, house-father,<br/> is the meaning of the word<br/> "home-haunter."</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, house-father,<br/> is one a "home-abandoner"?</p>

    <p class="f4">Now as to the material element, house-father,<br/> that desire, that lust, that lure,<br/> that craving,<br/> those system-graspings,<br/> that mental standpoint,<br/> that dogmatic bias<br/> which is inherent therein<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> — all these for a Tathāgata are struck off,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like a palm-tree stump,<br/> made things that have ceased to be,<br/> so that they cannot grow up again in the future.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">So it is also, house-father,<br/> with the feeling-element,<br/> the perception-element,<br/> the activities-element,<br/> the consciousness-element<br/> — that desire, that lust, that lure,<br/> cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, house-father,<br/> a Tathāgata is called "home-abandoner."</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the meaning of the word.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is one an "adherent"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span>?</p>

    <p class="f4">One who is in bondage to the impressions<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> of things seen, house-father,<br/> is called "adherent."</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise with regard to sounds,<br/> smells,<br/> savours,<br/> tangibles<br/> and mental objects<br/> — he who is in bondage to these impressions<br/> is called "adherent."</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is one "non-adherent," house-father?</p>

    <p class="f4">Such bondage to impressions of things seen is,<br/> for a Tathāgata,<br/> struck off,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like a palm-tree <span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span> stump,<br/> made things that have ceased to be,<br/> so that they cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, house-father, a Tathāgata is called "non-adherent."</p>

    <p class="f4">So also with regard to sounds,<br/> smells,<br/> savours,<br/> tangibles<br/> and mental objects<br/> — such bondage is not found in a Tathāgata:<br/> therefore is he called "non-adherent."</p>

    <p class="f4">That, house-father, is the meaning of the word.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is one "a former of ties in the village"?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, house-father,<br/> a certain one lives intimate with householders.</p>

    <p class="f4">He shares their joys and sorrows;<br/> among the happy he is happy,<br/> among the unhappy he is unhappy.<br/> When affairs of business arise,<br/> he involves himself in these.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, house-father, is how one is "a former of ties in the village."</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is one "no former of ties in the village"?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, house-father, a brother<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> dwells not associating with householders:<br/> he shares not their joys and sorrows,<br/> is not happy amid the happy,<br/> unhappy amid the unhappy.<br/> When affairs of business arise,<br/> he does not involve himself in them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, house-father, one forms no ties in the village.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is one "not empty"?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, house-father, a certain one<br/> has not abandoned lust,<br/> has not abandoned desire,<br/> nor affection,<br/> nor thirst,<br/> nor fever and craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, house-father, he is "not empty."</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is one "empty"?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, house-father, a certain one<br/> has abandoned lust,<br/> has abandoned desire,<br/> likewise affection<br/> and thirst,<br/> fever and craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, house-father, is one "empty."</p>

    <p class="f4">And how does one "show no preference"?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, house-father, one thinks thus:<br/> "May I have such and such a body in future time:<br/> may I feel thus and thus:<br/> may I perceive thus and thus:<br/> may my activities be such and such:<br/> may my consciousness be such and such in future time."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, house-father, does one show preference.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span> And how does one "show no preference"?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, house-father, one does not think thus:<br/> "May I have such and such a body in future time:<br/> may I feel,<br/> may I perceive thus and thus:<br/> may my activities be such and such:<br/> may my consciousness be such and such in future time."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, house-father, does one show no preference.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is one a "wager of wordy warfare with people"?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, house-father, a certain one makes talk like this:<br/> "You know not about this norm-discipline.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/> I do know about this norm-discipline.<br/> How could you know about it?<br/> You have fallen on wrong views.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/> I have come by right views.<br/> You speak last what should come first,<br/> and first what should come last.<br/> I am speaking to the point:<br/> you are not.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span><br/> What you have thought out so long is quite upset:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span><br/> Your view is confuted.<br/> Go, explain yourself.<br/> You are shown up.<br/> Clear yourself if you can!"</p>

    <p class="f4">That, house-father, is how one is a<br/> "wager of wordy warfare with people."</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is one<br/> "no wager of wordy warfare with people"?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, house-father, a brother makes not talk like this:<br/> "You know not about this norm-discipline.<br/> I do know about this norm-discipline.<br/> How could you know about it?<br/> You have fallen on wrong views.<br/> I have come by right views.<br/> You speak last what should come first,<br/> and first what should come last.<br/> I am speaking to the point:<br/> you are not.<br/> What you have thought out so long is quite upset:<br/> Your view is confuted.<br/> Go, explain yourself.<br/> You are shown up.<br/> Clear yourself if you can!"</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how one is "no wager of wordy warfare with people."</p>

    <p class="f4">And this, house-father, is the meaning<br/> of what was said by the Exalted One<br/> in the eighth chapter of Questions, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Home he abandons: homeless wandering<br/> The sage with village-folk not making ties.<br/> Empty of lusts, showing no preference,<br/> With no man wageth wordy warfare more.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, house-father, should be understood in full<br/> what was concisely stated by the Exalted One.'</p>
