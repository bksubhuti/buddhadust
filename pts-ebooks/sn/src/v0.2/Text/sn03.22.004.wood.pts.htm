    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Kaccāna the Great was staying among the folk of Avanti at Ospreys' Haunt<br/> on a sheer mountain crag.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the house-father, Hāliddikāni came to the venerable Kaccāna the Great.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat beside him,<br/> the house-father Hāliddikāni said to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Thus was it said, Master, by the Exalted One,<br/> in the <i>Questions of Sakka:</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Those recluses and brahmins<br/> who are freed by the utter destruction of craving,<br/> they only are fully proficient,<br/> they only have fully reached the infinite safety,<br/> they only fully live the righteous life,<br/> have fully reached the goal<br/> — best of devas and men are they."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, Master, how should one regard<br/> the full meaning of this concise saying<br/> of the Exalted One?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'As to the material element, house-father,<br/> that desire,<br/> that lust,<br/> that lure,<br/> that craving,<br/> those system-graspings,<br/> that mental standpoint,<br/> that dogmatic bias<br/> which is inherent therein<br/> — it is by the destruction,<br/> by the not lusting for,<br/> by the cessation,<br/> the giving up,<br/> the utter surrender of those things<br/> that the heart is called "fully freed."</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise as regards the feeling-element,<br/> the perception-element,<br/> the activities-element,<br/> and the consciousness-element,</p>

    <p class="f4">I repeat ... it is by the destruction of these,<br/> the not lusting for these,<br/> it is by the cessation,<br/> the giving up,<br/> the utter surrender of these things<br/> that the heart is called "fully freed."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, house-father, what was said by the Exalted One<br/> in the Questions of Sakka, to wit:<br/> "Those recluses and brahmins<br/> who are freed by the utter destruction of craving,<br/> they only are fully proficient,<br/> they only have fully reached the infinite safety,<br/> fully practise the righteous life,<br/> have fully reached the goal<br/> — best of devas and men are they"<br/> — that is how one should regard the full meaning<br/> of this concise saying of the Exalted One.'</p>
