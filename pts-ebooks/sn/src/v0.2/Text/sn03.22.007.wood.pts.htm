    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then thus spake the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will show you grasping and worry, brethren:<br/> likewise not grasping and not worrying.<br/> Listen to it,<br/> apply your minds to it thoroughly<br/> and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord,' replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'And how, brethren, is there grasping and worry?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the untaught many- <span class="f2 g"><b>[17]</b></span> folk,<br/> who discern not those who are Ariyans,<br/> who are unskilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> untrained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who discern not those who are worthy,<br/> who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/> untrained in the worthy doctrine<br/> — these regard body as the self,<br/> the self as having body,<br/> body as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> the body alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the altering<br/> and otherwiseness of the body,<br/> his consciousness is busied<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> with the altering body.</p>

    <p class="f4">From this being busied with the altering body,<br/> worried thoughts arise and persist,<br/> laying hold of the heart.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">From this laying hold of the heart<br/> he becomes troubled,<br/> and owing to vexation and clinging<br/> he is worried.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards feeling as the self,<br/> the self as having feeling,<br/> feeling as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">From this being busied with the altering feeling,<br/> worried thoughts arise and persist,<br/> laying hold of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">From this laying hold of the heart<br/> he becomes troubled,<br/> and owing to vexation and clinging<br/> he is worried.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards perception as the self,<br/> the self as having perception,<br/> perception as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> perception alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the altering<br/> and otherwiseness of perception,<br/> his consciousness is busied with the altering perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">From this being busied with the altering perception,<br/> worried thoughts arise and persist,<br/> laying hold of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">From this laying hold of the heart<br/> he becomes troubled,<br/> and owing to vexation and clinging<br/> he is worried.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards the activities as the self,<br/> the self as having the activities,<br/> the activities as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> the activities alter and become otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the altering<br/> and otherwiseness of the activities,<br/> his consciousness is busied with the altering activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">From this laying hold of the heart<br/> he becomes troubled,<br/> and owing to vexation and clinging<br/> he is worried.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, brethren, comes grasping and worry.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, brethren, is there no grasping and worry?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein the well-taught Ariyan disciple,<br/> who discerns those that are Ariyans,<br/> who is skilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> well trained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> skilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/> well trained in the worthy doctrine<br/> — these regard not body as the self,<br/> regard not the self as having body,<br/> regard not body as being in the self,<br/> regard not the self as being in the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> the body alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of body,<br/> his consciousness is not busied with the altering body.</p>

    <p class="f4">From not being busied with the altering body,<br/> worried thoughts do not arise and persist,<br/> laying hold of the heart.</p>
