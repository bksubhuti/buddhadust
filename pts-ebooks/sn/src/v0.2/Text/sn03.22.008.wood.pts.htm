    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then thus spake the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will show you grasping and worry, brethren:<br/> likewise not grasping and not worrying.<br/> Listen to it,<br/> apply your minds to it thoroughly<br/> and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord,' replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'And how, brethren, is there grasping and worry?</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, brethren, is there grasping and worry?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the untaught many-folk have this view:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This body is mine:<br/> I am this:<br/> this is my self."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> the body alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of body,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair arise in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">"This feeling is mine:<br/> I am this:<br/> this is my self."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> feeling alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of feeling,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair arise in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">"This perception is mine:<br/> I am this:<br/> this is my self."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> perception alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of perception,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair arise in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">"These activities are mine:<br/> I am this:<br/> this is my self."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> the activities alter and become otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of the activities,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair arise in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">"This consciousness is mine:<br/> I am this:<br/> this is my self."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> consciousness alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of consciousness,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair arise in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, brethren, is there grasping and worry.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, brethren, is there no grasping and no worry?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple has this view:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This body is not mine:<br/> I am not this:<br/> this is not my self."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> the body alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of body,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">"This feeling is not mine:<br/> I am not this:<br/> this is not my self."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> feeling alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of feeling,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">"This perception is not mine:<br/> I am not this:<br/> this is not my self."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> perception alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of perception,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">"These activities are not mine:<br/> I am not this:<br/> this is not my self."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> the activities alter and become otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of the activities,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">"This consciousness is not mine:<br/> I am not this:<br/> this is not my self."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of such an one<br/> consciousness alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of consciousness,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him.</p>
