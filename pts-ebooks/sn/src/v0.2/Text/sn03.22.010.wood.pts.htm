    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus addressed the brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Body, brethren, is an ill,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> cares not for a body that is past,<br/> is not in love with a body to be,<br/> and for the present body<br/> seeks to be repelled by it,<br/> seeks dispassion for it,<br/> seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Feeling, brethren, is an ill,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> cares not for feeling that is past,<br/> is not in love with feeling to be,<br/> and for the present feeling<br/> seeks to be repelled by it,<br/> seeks dispassion for it,<br/> seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Perception, brethren, is an ill,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> cares not for perception that is past,<br/> is not in love with perception to be,<br/> and for the present perception<br/> seeks to be repelled by it,<br/> seeks dispassion for it,<br/> seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">'The activities, brethren, are an ill,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> cares not for the activities that are past,<br/> is not in love with the activities to be,<br/> and for the present activities<br/> seeks to be repelled by them,<br/> seeks dispassion for them,<br/> seeks the ceasing of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, consciousness is an ill,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> cares not for consciousness that is past,<br/> is not in love with consciousnesses to be,<br/> and for present consciousness<br/> seeks to be repelled by it,<br/> seeks dispassion for it,<br/> seeks the ceasing of it.'
