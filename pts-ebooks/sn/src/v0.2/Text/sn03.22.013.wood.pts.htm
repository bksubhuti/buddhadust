    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is ill,<br/> feeling, is ill,<br/> perception, is ill,<br/> the activities, are ill,<br/> consciousness is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by body,<br/> is repelled by feeling,<br/> is repelled by perception,<br/> is repelled by the activities<br/> is repelled by consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled<br/> he lusts not<br/> not lusting he is set free<br/> in this freedom comes insight<br/> that it is a being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is my task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>
