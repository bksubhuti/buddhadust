    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/> that is suffering.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Feeling, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Perception, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The activities, brethren, are impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Consciousness, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by body,<br/> is repelled by feeling,<br/> is repelled by perception,<br/> is repelled by the activities<br/> is repelled by consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled<br/> he lusts not<br/> not lusting he is set free<br/> in this freedom comes insight<br/> that it is a being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is my task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>

See <i>Pāli Dict.</i> s.v. which suggests 'ease' and 'dis-ease,' 'wealth and illth,' 'well-being' and 'ill-being.' But all these words have now various significances. 'Ill-fare' is used in Elizabethan literature. Buddhaghosa defines the word at <i>V.M.</i> 461, and at p. 494 attempts its derivation (not very successfully) in <i>du,</i> 'mean, inferior'; 'khaṁ,' empty. But the underlying idea seems to be 'ill-put-together, temporary, unreal, unsatisfactory.' <i>Cf.</i> <i>Expositor</i> i, 53,54, and note on next page; Mrs. Rhys Davids, <i>Bud.
