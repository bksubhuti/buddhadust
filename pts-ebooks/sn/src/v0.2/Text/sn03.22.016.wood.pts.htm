    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is ill-faring.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Feeling, brethren, is ill-faring.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Perception, brethren, is ill-faring.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The activities, brethren, are ill-faring.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Consciousness, brethren, is ill-faring.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not it,<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by body,<br/> is repelled by feeling,<br/> is repelled by perception,<br/> is repelled by the activities<br/> is repelled by consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled<br/> he lusts not<br/> not lusting he is set free<br/> in this freedom comes insight<br/> that it is a being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is my task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>
