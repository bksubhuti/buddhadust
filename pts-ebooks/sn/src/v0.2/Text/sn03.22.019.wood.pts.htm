    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/> that which is the condition<br/> of the arising of body,<br/> that also is ill.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">How, brethren, can a body<br/> which is compounded of ill<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> come to be ease?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/> that which is the condition<br/> of the uprising of feeling,<br/> that also is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">How, brethren, can feeling<br/> which is compounded of ill<br/> come to be ease?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Perception is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/> that which is the condition<br/> of the uprising of perception,<br/> that also is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">How, brethren, can perception<br/> which is compounded of ill<br/> come to be ease?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The activities are ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/> that which is the condition<br/> of the uprising of the activities,<br/> that also is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">How, brethren, can the activities<br/> which are compounded of ill<br/> come to be ease?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Consciousness is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/> that which is the condition<br/> of the uprising of consciousness,<br/> that also is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">How, brethren, can consciousness<br/> which is compounded of ill<br/> come to be ease?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by body,<br/> is repelled by feeling,<br/> is repelled by perception,<br/> is repelled by the activities<br/> is repelled by consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled<br/> he lusts not<br/> not lusting he is set free<br/> in this freedom comes insight<br/> that it is a being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is my task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Here especially the translation of <i>dukkha-sambhūtaṁ,</i> 'ill-put together,' will better bring out the idea of a compost. The universe would seem to be 'bungled' by its causes, as 'Nature trying her 'prentice band,' or 'created by some lesser god,' as Tennyson puts it in <i>The Idylls of the King.</i> It is an experiment. This significance of 'ill-state' is suggested to me by Mr. J. van Manen. The phrase <i>sukaṁ viharati</i>, 'lives at ease,' means 'the mind-feeling-body-compound,' works perfectly, like a well-made and well-oiled machine.</p>
