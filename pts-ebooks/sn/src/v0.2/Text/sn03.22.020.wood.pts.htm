    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/> that which is the condition<br/> of the arising of body,<br/> that also is void of the self.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">How, brethren, can a body<br/> which is void of the self<br/> come to be the self?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/> that which is the condition<br/> of the uprising of feeling,<br/> that also is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">How, brethren, can feeling<br/> which is void of the self<br/> come to be self?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Perception is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/> that which is the condition<br/> of the uprising of perception,<br/> that also is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">How, brethren, can perception<br/> which is void of the self<br/> come to be self?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The activities are void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/> that which is the condition<br/> of the uprising of the activities,<br/> that also is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">How, brethren, can the activities<br/> which are void of the self<br/> come to be self?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Consciousness is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/> that which is the condition<br/> of the uprising of consciousness,<br/> that also is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">How, brethren, can consciousness<br/> which is void of the self<br/> come to be self?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by body,<br/> is repelled by feeling,<br/> is repelled by perception,<br/> is repelled by the activities<br/> is repelled by consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled<br/> he lusts not<br/> not lusting he is set free<br/> in this freedom comes insight<br/> that it is a being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is my task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>
