    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"That desire and lust, brethren,<br/> which is in body,<br/> do ye renounce them.</p>

    <p class="f4">So will that body become rejected,<br/> cut down <span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span> at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">"That desire and lust, brethren,<br/> which is in feeling,<br/> do ye renounce them.</p>

    <p class="f4">So will that feeling become rejected,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">"That desire and lust, brethren,<br/> which is in perception,<br/> do ye renounce them.</p>

    <p class="f4">So will that perception become rejected,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">"That desire and lust, brethren,<br/> which is in the activities,<br/> do ye renounce them.</p>

    <p class="f4">So will those activities become rejected,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that they cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">"That desire and lust, brethren,<br/> which is in consciousness,<br/> do ye renounce them.</p>

    <p class="f4">So will that consciousness become rejected,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot grow up again in the future."</p>
