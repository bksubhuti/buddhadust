    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Formerly, brethren,<br/> before I was enlightened with the supreme enlightenment,<br/> when I was yet a Bodhisatta,<br/> I thought thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> what is the misery of,<br/> what is the way of escape<br/> from body?</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what is the satisfaction,<br/> what is the misery of,<br/> what is the way of escape<br/> from feeling?</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what is the satisfaction,<br/> what is the misery of,<br/> what is the way of escape<br/> from perception?</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what is the satisfaction,<br/> what is the misery of,<br/> what is the way of escape<br/> from the activities?</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what is the satisfaction,<br/> what is the misery of,<br/> what is the way of escape<br/> from consciousness?'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, brethren, to me there came this thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That ease, that pleasure<br/> which arises owing to body:<br/> that is the satisfaction of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">That impermanence,<br/> that suffering,<br/> that instability<br/> which is body,<br/> that is the misery of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust,<br/> that renouncing of desire and lust<br/> which are in body, -<br/> that is the way of escape from body.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span> So long, brethren, as I did not thoroughly understand,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the satisfaction of these five factors of grasping as such,<br/> the misery of it as such,<br/> the way of escape from it as such, -<br/> so long, brethren, was I doubtful<br/> whether I was enlightened<br/> with that supreme enlightenment,<br/> unsurpassed in the world<br/> with its devas,<br/> its Māras,<br/> its Brahmas,<br/> among the host of recluses and brahmins<br/> and of devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">But as soon, brethren, as I thoroughly understood,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the satisfaction of these five factors of grasping as such,<br/> the misery of it as such,<br/> the way of escape from it as such, -<br/> then, brethren, I knew for certain<br/> that I was enlightened<br/> with that supreme enlightenment<br/> unsurpassed in the world,<br/> with its devas,<br/> its Māras,<br/> its Brahmas,<br/> among the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/> and of devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, indeed, the knowledge arose in me<br/> and insight arose in me: -</p>
