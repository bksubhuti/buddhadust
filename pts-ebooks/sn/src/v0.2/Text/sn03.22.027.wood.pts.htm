    <p class="f4">So long, brethren, as I did not thoroughly understand,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the satisfaction of these five factors of grasping as such,<br/> the misery of it as such,<br/> the way of escape from it as such, -<br/> so long, brethren, was I doubtful<br/> whether I was enlightened<br/> with that supreme enlightenment,<br/> unsurpassed in the world<br/> with its devas,<br/> its Māras,<br/> its Brahmas,<br/> among the host of recluses and brahmins<br/> and of devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, indeed, the knowledge arose in me<br/> and insight arose in me: -</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sure is my release.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my last birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no more rebirth for me now.'"</p>
