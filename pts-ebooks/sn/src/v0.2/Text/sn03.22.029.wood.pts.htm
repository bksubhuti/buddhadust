    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4"></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who takes delight, brethren, in body,<br/> takes delight in suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes delight in suffering,<br/> I declare,<br/> that he is not released from suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who takes delight, brethren, in feeling,<br/> takes delight in suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes delight in suffering,<br/> I declare,<br/> that he is not released from suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who takes delight, brethren, in perception,<br/> takes delight in suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes delight in suffering,<br/> I declare,<br/> that he is not released from suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who takes delight, brethren, in the activities,<br/> takes delight in suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes delight in suffering,<br/> I declare,<br/> that he is not released from suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who takes delight, brethren, in consciousness,<br/> takes delight in suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who takes delight in suffering,<br/> I declare,<br/> that he is not released from suffering.</p>
