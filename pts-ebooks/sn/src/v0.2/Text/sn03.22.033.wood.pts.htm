    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is not of you, brethren, put it away. Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[32]</b></span> And what, brethren, is not of you?</p>

    <p class="f4">Body, brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away<br/> will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away<br/> will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away<br/> will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away<br/> will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away<br/> will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if, brethren,<br/> a man should gather,<br/> burn,<br/> or do what he please<br/> with all the grass,<br/> all the sticks,<br/> branches<br/> and stalks<br/> in this Jeta Grove, -<br/> pray would ye say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This man is gathering, burning us,<br/> doing what he please with us?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, lord, this is not our self, nor of the nature of self."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, brethren, body is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away<br/> will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away<br/> will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away<br/> will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away<br/> will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away<br/> will be for your profit and welfare.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
