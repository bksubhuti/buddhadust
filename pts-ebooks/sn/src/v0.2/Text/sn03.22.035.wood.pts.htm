    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/> In Jeta Grove,<br/> at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <h4 class="ctr sigil_not_in_toc">I</h4>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well for me,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> lord,<br/> if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine in a few words,<br/> so that hearing the teaching of the Exalted One<br/> I might dwell solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent <span class="f2 g"><b>[33]</b></span><br/> and aspiring.'</p>

    <p class="f4">(The Exalted One said):</p>

    <p class="f4">"That for which a brother has a bias,<br/> by that he is reckoned.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That for which he does not have a bias,<br/> by that he is not reckoned."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I understand, 0 Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">I understand, 0 Well-farer!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"But how far, brother, do you understand in full<br/> the meaning of what I have thus concisely stated?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to body, lord,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he cleave to feeling,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he cleave to perception,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he cleave to the activities,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he cleave to consciousness,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">And if, lord, he cleave not to body,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he cleave not to feeling,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he cleave not to perception,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he cleave not to the activities,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he cleave not to consciousness,<br/> he gets no name thereby."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said! Well said, brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well do you understand in full<br/> the meaning of what I concisely stated.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to body,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">If one cleave to feeling,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">If one cleave to perception,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">If one cleave to the activities,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">If one cleave to consciousness,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">And if one cleave not to body,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">If one cleave not to feeling,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">If one cleave not to perception,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">If one cleave not to the activities,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">If one cleave not to consciousness,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how to understand in full<br/> the meaning of what I concisely stated."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then that brother welcomed the saying of the Exalted One,<br/> and was pleased thereat,<br/> and he rose from his seat,<br/> saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/> and departed.</p>

    <h4 class="ctr sigil_not_in_toc">II.</h4>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon that brother,<br/> living solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent and aspiring,<br/> in no long time attained that goal<br/> for which the clansmen rightly leave home<br/> for the homeless life,<br/> even that unrivalled goal of righteous living;<br/> attained it even in that very life:<br/> and knowing it for himself,<br/> realizing it for himself,<br/> abode therein,<br/> so that he came to know:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed <span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span>  is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is my task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And that brother was now one of the saints.</p>

Warren, 'comes to be' (see below, § 36) Mrs Rhys Davids writes: I think the teaching is this: if your bias, bent, leaning, preoccupation is towards the life of the body, or the things of the worldly mind, you come to be reckoned accordingly; your measure is taken thereby - <i>i.e.,</i> you are materialistic, a pleasure-lover, or you are clever, wordy, astute, etc. The true way is to turn aside from both.</p>
