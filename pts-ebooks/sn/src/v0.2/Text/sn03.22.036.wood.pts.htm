    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <h4 class="ctr sigil_not_in_toc">I</h4>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well for me, lord,<br/> if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine in a few words,<br/> so that hearing the teaching of the Exalted One<br/> I might dwell solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring.'</p>

    <p class="f4">(The Exalted One said):</p>

    <p class="f4">"That for which one has a bias,<br/> one takes as measure.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes as measure,<br/> by that he is reckoned."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That for which one has a no bias,<br/> one takes not as measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes not as measure,<br/> by that he is not reckoned."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I understand, 0 Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">I understand, 0 Well-farer!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"But how far, brother, do you understand in full<br/> the meaning of what I have thus concisely stated?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to body, lord,<br/> that one takes as a measure.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That which he takes as a measure,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to feeling,<br/> that one takes as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which he takes as a measure,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to perception,<br/> that one takes as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which he takes as a measure,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to the activities,<br/> that one takes as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which he takes as a measure,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to consciousness,<br/> that one takes as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which he takes as a measure,<br/> by that he gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave not to body, lord,<br/> that one takes not as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which he takes not as a measure,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave not to feeling,<br/> that one takes not as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which he takes not as a measure,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave not to perception,<br/> that one takes not as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which he takes not as a measure,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave not to the activities,<br/> that one takes not as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which he takes not as a measure,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave not to consciousness,<br/> that one takes not as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which he takes not as a measure,<br/> he gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said! Well said, brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well do you understand in full<br/> the meaning of what I concisely stated.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to body,<br/> that one takes as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes as a measure,<br/> by that one gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to feeling,<br/> that one takes as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes as a measure,<br/> by that one gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to perception,<br/> that one takes as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes as a measure,<br/> by that one gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to the activities,<br/> that one takes as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes as a measure,<br/> by that one gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave to consciousness,<br/> that one takes as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes as a measure,<br/> by that one gets a name.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave not to body, lord,<br/> that one takes not as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes not as a measure,<br/> one gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave not to feeling,<br/> that one takes not as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes not as a measure,<br/> one gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave not to perception,<br/> that one takes not as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes not as a measure,<br/> one gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave not to the activities,<br/> that one takes not as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes not as a measure,<br/> one gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">"If one cleave not to consciousness,<br/> that one takes not as a measure.</p>

    <p class="f4">That which one takes not as a measure,<br/> one gets no name thereby.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how to understand in full<br/> the meaning of what I concisely stated."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then that brother welcomed the saying of the Exalted One,<br/> and was pleased thereat,<br/> and he rose from his seat,<br/> saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/> and departed.</p>

    <h4 class="ctr sigil_not_in_toc">II.</h4>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon that brother,<br/> living solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent and aspiring,<br/> in no long time attained that goal<br/> for which the clansmen rightly leave home<br/> for the homeless life,<br/> even that unrivalled goal of righteous living;<br/> attained it even in that very life:<br/> and knowing it for himself,<br/> realizing it for himself,<br/> abode therein,<br/> so that he came to know:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is my task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter!'</p>

    <p class="f4">And that brother was now one of the saints.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> 'That body which one cleaves to ... perishes when the cleaving dies away. When the object dissolves, the objective states no longer hold together.' So we read (<i>K.S.</i> ii, 45), 'if we are occupied about something, this becomes an object for the persistence of consciousness, whence birth takes place.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward's abridgement leaves us without knowing how he would have constructed the following which is not identical to the previous Sutta. I have reconstructed it as I believe he might have done.</p>
