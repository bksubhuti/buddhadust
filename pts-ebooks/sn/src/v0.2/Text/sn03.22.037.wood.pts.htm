    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/> In Jeta Grove,<br/> at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side,<br/> the Exalted One thus addressed the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"If they were to ask you, Ānanda,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friend Ānanda, what are the things<br/> in which is discerned uprising,<br/> in which is discerned passing away,<br/> in which is discerned otherwiseness<br/> while they last?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> -</p>

    <p class="f4">what would you reply to such a question?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"If they asked me, lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friend Ānanda, what are the things<br/> in which is discerned uprising,<br/> in which is discerned passing away,<br/> in which is discerned otherwiseness<br/> while they last?'</p>

    <p class="f4">thus, lord, should I make answer:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is of body, friends,<br/> that uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts <span class="f2 g"><b>[35]</b></span> is discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is of feeling, friends,<br/> that uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is of perception, friends,<br/> that uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is of the activities, friends,<br/> that uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is of consciousness, friends,<br/> that uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the things, friends,<br/> in which uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus questioned, lord, thus should I make answer."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said! Well said, Ānanda!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is indeed of body, Ānanda,<br/> that uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is of feeling, friends,<br/> that uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is of perception, friends,<br/> that uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is of the activities, friends,<br/> that uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is of consciousness, friends,<br/> that uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.</p>

    <p class="f4">These indeed, Ānanda, are the things<br/> in which uprising is discerned,<br/> that passing away is discerned,<br/> that otherwiseness while it lasts is discerned.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus questioned, Ānanda, thus should you make answer.'</p>
