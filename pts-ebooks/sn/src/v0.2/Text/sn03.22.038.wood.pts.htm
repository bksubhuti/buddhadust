    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/> In Jeta Grove,<br/> at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side,<br/> the Exalted One thus addressed the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"If they were to ask you, Ānanda,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friend Ānanda, Ānanda,<br/> what are the things<br/> in which uprising has been discerned,<br/> in which passing away has been discerned,<br/> in which otherwiseness while they last has been discerned?</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the things<br/> in which uprising will be discerned,<br/> in which passing away will be discerned,<br/> in which otherwiseness while they last will be discerned?</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the things<br/> in which uprising is even now discerned,<br/> in which passing away is even now discerned,<br/> in which otherwiseness while they last is even now discerned?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus questioned, Ānanda,<br/> what would you reply?"</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">If I were thus questioned, lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friend Ānanda,<br/> what are the things<br/> in which uprising has been discerned,<br/> in which passing away has been discerned,<br/> in which otherwiseness while they last has been discerned?</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the things<br/> in which uprising will be discerned,<br/> in which passing away will be discerned,<br/> in which otherwiseness while they last will be discerned?</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the things<br/> in which uprising is even now discerned,<br/> in which passing away is even now discerned,<br/> in which otherwiseness while they last is even now discerned?'</p>

    <p class="f4">thus should I reply:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The body, friends, which is past,<br/> perished,<br/> altered,<br/> of which uprising has been discerned,<br/> of which passing away has been discerned,<br/> of which otherwiseness while it lasts has been discerned;</p>

    <p class="f4">the feeling, friends, which is past,<br/> perished,<br/> altered,<br/> of which uprising has been discerned,<br/> of which passing away has been discerned,<br/> of which otherwiseness while it lasts has been discerned;</p>

    <p class="f4">the perception, friends, which is past,<br/> perished,<br/> altered,<br/> of which uprising has been discerned,<br/> of which passing away has been discerned,<br/> of which otherwiseness while it lasts has been discerned;</p>

    <p class="f4">the activities, friends, which are past,<br/> perished,<br/> altered,<br/> of which uprising has been discerned,<br/> of which passing away has been discerned,<br/> of which otherwiseness while they last has been discerned;</p>

    <p class="f4">the consciousness, friends, which is past,<br/> perished,<br/> altered,<br/> of which uprising has been discerned,<br/> of which passing away has been discerned,<br/> of which otherwiseness while it lasts has been discerned;</p>

    <p class="f4">these, friends, are the things<br/> in which uprising has been discerned,<br/> in which passing away has been discerned,<br/> in which otherwiseness while they last has been discerned.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, friends, of that body which is unborn,<br/> not yet manifested,<br/> uprising will be discerned,<br/> passing away will be discerned,<br/> otherwiseness while it lasts, will be discerned;</p>

    <p class="f4">of that feeling which is unborn,<br/> not yet manifested,<br/> uprising will be discerned,<br/> passing away will be discerned,<br/> otherwiseness while it lasts, will be discerned;</p>
