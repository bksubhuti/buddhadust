    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Of that brother, brethren, who is versed in conformity to the Norm,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> this is the accordant practice:</p>

    <p class="f4">He should abide in the utter disgust for body,<br/> he should abide in the utter disgust for feeling,<br/> he should abide in the utter disgust for perception,<br/> he should abide in the utter disgust for the activities,<br/> he should abide in the utter disgust for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">So abiding in the utter disgust for body,<br/> in the utter disgust for feeling,<br/> in the utter disgust for perception,<br/> in the utter disgust for the activities,<br/> in the utter disgust for consciousness,<br/> he fully discerns body,<br/> he fully discerns feeling,<br/> he fully discerns perception,<br/> he fully discerns the activities,<br/> he fully discerns consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Fully discerning body,<br/> fully discerning feeling,<br/> fully discerning perception,<br/> fully discerning the activities,<br/> fully discerning consciousness;<br/> he is released from body,<br/> he is released from feeling,<br/> he is released from perception,<br/> he is released from activities,<br/> he is released from consciousness,<br/> he is released from rebirth,<br/> old age and decay,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> from woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">I declare him to be released from suffering."</p>
