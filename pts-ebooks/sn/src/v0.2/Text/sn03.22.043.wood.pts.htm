    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then (the Exalted One) said:—</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do ye abide, brethren,<br/> islands unto yourselves,<br/> refuges unto yourselves:<br/> taking refuge in none other;<br/> islanded by the Norm,<br/> taking refuge in the Norm,<br/> seeking refuge in none other.</p>

    <p class="f4">By them who are islands unto themselves, brethren,<br/> who are a refuge unto themselves,<br/> who take refuge in none other,<br/> who are islanded by the Norm,<br/> take refuge in the Norm,<br/> seek refuge in none other<br/> — by them the very source of things<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> is to be searched for: thus<br/> — "What is the source of sorrow and grief,<br/> of woe, lamentation and despair?<br/> What is their origin?"</p>

    <p class="f4">What then, brethren,<br/> is the source,<br/> the origin of these?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren,<br/> the untaught many-folk,<br/> who discern not those that are Ariyans,<br/> who are unskilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> untrained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who discern not those who are worthy ones,<br/> who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/> untrained in the worthy doctrine,<br/> — these regard the body as the self,<br/> the self as having body,<br/> body as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">But [the well-taught Ariyan disciple]<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> beholding, brethren,<br/> the impermanence of body,<br/> its instability,<br/> its coming to an end,<br/> its ceasing, says:<br/> "Formerly also,<br/> as well as now,<br/> all bodies were impermanent and suffering,<br/> unstable in nature."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus seeing it as it really is,<br/> by perfect insight,<br/> he puts away from him<br/> all sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair;<br/> nor is he troubled at <span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span> their putting away,<br/> but untroubled lives at ease<br/> and so living at ease<br/> that brother is called<br/> "one who is rid of all that."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Beholding, brethren,<br/> the impermanence of feeling,<br/> its instability,<br/> its coming to an end,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> he says:<br/> "Formerly also,<br/> as well as now,<br/> all feeling was impermanent and suffering,<br/> unstable in its nature."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus seeing it as it really is,<br/> by perfect insight,<br/> he puts away from him<br/> all sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair:<br/> nor is he troubled at their putting away,<br/> but untroubled lives at ease,<br/> and so living at ease<br/> this brother is called:<br/> "One who is rid of all that."</p>

    <p class="f4">So also with regard to perception,<br/> the activities<br/> and consciousness.'</p>
