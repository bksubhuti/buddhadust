    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, brethren,<br/> both the way going to the arising of bodyhood,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> and the way going to the ceasing of bodyhood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And which, brethren,<br/> is the way going to the arising of bodyhood?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the untaught many-folk,<br/> who discern not those that are Ariyans,<br/> who are unskilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> untrained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who discern not those who are worthy ones,<br/> who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/> untrained in the worthy doctrine, —<br/> view body as the self<br/> the self as possessed of body,<br/> body as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in body;</p>

    <p class="f4">view feeling as the self<br/> the self as possessed of feeling,<br/> feeling as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in feeling;</p>

    <p class="f4">view perception as the self<br/> the self as possessed of perception,<br/> perception as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in perception;</p>

    <p class="f4">view the activities as the self<br/> the self as possessed of the activities,<br/> the activities as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in the activities;</p>

    <p class="f4">view consciousness as the self<br/> the self as possessed of consciousness,<br/> consciousness as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The way going to the arising of bodyhood.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So the meaning here is just this -<br/> it is called, brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The view going to the arising of suffering.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And which, brethren, is the way going to the ceasing of bodyhood?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple,<br/> who discerns those that are Ariyans,<br/> who is skilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> trained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who discerns those who are worthy ones,<br/> who is skilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/> trained in the worthy doctrine, —<br/> regards not body as the self<br/> regards not the self as possessed of body,<br/> regards not body as being in the self,<br/> regards not the self as being in body;</p>

    <p class="f4">regards not feeling as the self<br/> regards not the self as possessed of feeling,<br/> regards not feeling as being in the self,<br/> regards not the self as being in feeling;</p>

    <p class="f4">regards not perception as the self<br/> regards not the self as possessed of perception,<br/> regards not perception as being in the self,<br/> regards not the self as being in perception;</p>

    <p class="f4">regards not consciousness as the self<br/> regards not the self as possessed of consciousness,<br/> regards not consciousness as being in the self,<br/> regards not the self as being in consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[39]</b></span> This, brethren, is called:</p>
