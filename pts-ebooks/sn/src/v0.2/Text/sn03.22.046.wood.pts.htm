    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is without the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not that,<br/> not of me is this self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus should one view it<br/> by perfect insight<br/> as it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Feeling, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is without the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not that,<br/> not of me is this self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus should one view it<br/> by perfect insight<br/> as it really is.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Perception, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is without the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not that,<br/> not of me is this self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus should one view it<br/> by perfect insight<br/> as it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The activities, brethren, are impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is without the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not that,<br/> not of me is this self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus should one view it<br/> by perfect insight<br/> as it really is.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Consciousness, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is without the self,<br/> that is not mine,<br/> I am not that,<br/> not of me is this self.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">For the one who thus sees it<br/> as it really is<br/> by perfect insight,<br/> there is no more guessing at the far-off past.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">As there is no more guessing at the far-off past,<br/> there is no more guessing at the far-off future.</p>

    <p class="f4">As there is no more guessing at the far-off future,<br/> there is no stubborn<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> perversity.</p>

    <p class="f4">As there is no more stubborn perversity in him,<br/> his heart turns away from body,<br/> from feeling,<br/> perception,<br/> the activities<br/> and consciousness,<br/> and is released by not grasping at the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then by its release it is steadfast;||<br/> by its steadfastness it is happy;||<br/> by its happiness it is not troubled;||<br/> not being troubled,||<br/> of its own self it is utterly well;||<br/> so that he knows:|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,||<br/> lived is the righteous life,||<br/> done is the task,||<br/> for life in these conditions||<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>
