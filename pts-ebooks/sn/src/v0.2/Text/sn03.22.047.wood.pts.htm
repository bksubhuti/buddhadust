    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Those recluses and brahmins, brethren, who regard the self in divers ways,<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> regard it as the body-mass of five factors based on grasping,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> or as some one of these.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the untaught many-folk,<br/> who discern not those that are Ariyans,<br/> who are unskilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> untrained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who discern not those who are worthy ones,<br/> who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/> untrained in the worthy doctrine, —<br/> regard body as the self,<br/> self as possessed of body,<br/> body as being in the self,<br/> self as being in body;</p>

    <p class="f4">view feeling as the self<br/> the self as possessed of feeling,<br/> feeling as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in feeling;</p>

    <p class="f4">view perception as the self<br/> the self as possessed of perception,<br/> perception as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in perception;</p>

    <p class="f4">view the activities as the self<br/> the self as possessed of the activities,<br/> the activities as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in the activities;</p>

    <p class="f4">view consciousness as the self<br/> the self as possessed of consciousness,<br/> consciousness as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus this is the view.</p>

    <p class="f4">It has come to him (to think): 'I am.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now when it has come to anyone<br/> to think "I am,"<br/> there comes to pass a descent<br/> of the five feeling-faculties<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> the seeing-faculty,<br/> the hearing-faculty,<br/> the smelling-faculty,<br/> the tasting-faculty,<br/> the touching-faculty.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span> Mind is the result,<br/> mind-states<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> are the result,<br/> the ignorance-element is the result.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Touched by the feeling born of contact with ignorance,<br/> there comes to the untaught many-folk (the view),<br/> 'I am';</p>

    <p class="f4">there comes (the view),<br/> 'this same I am;"</p>

    <p class="f4">there comes (the view),<br/> 'things will be";</p>

    <p class="f4">there comes the view,<br/> 'things will not be";<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">there comes the view,<br/> 'things will have body';</p>

    <p class="f4">the view,<br/> 'things will be bodiless';</p>

    <p class="f4">there comes the view,<br/> 'things will be conscious';</p>

    <p class="f4">the view,<br/> 'things will be unconscious';</p>

    <p class="f4">the view,<br/> 'things will be neither conscious nor unconscious.'</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just therein, brethren,<br/> that the five feeling-faculties persist.</p>

    <p class="f4">But herein for the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> ignorance is put away and knowledge arises.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Along with the fading away of ignorance<br/> and the arising of knowledge<br/> there comes to him no view that<br/> "I am,"<br/> that<br/> "this same I am,"<br/> that<br/> "things will be,"<br/> that<br/> "things will not be,"<br/> that<br/> things will have body,"<br/> that<br/> things will not have body,"<br/> that<br/> things will be conscious,"<br/> that<br/> things will be unconscious,"<br/> that<br/> things will be neither conscious nor unconscious."'</p>
