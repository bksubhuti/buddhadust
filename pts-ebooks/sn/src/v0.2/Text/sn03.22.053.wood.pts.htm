    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Attachment, brethren, is bondage;<br/> aloofness is freedom.</p>

    <p class="f4">By attachment to body, brethren,<br/> consciousness,<br/> if it get a standing,<br/> may persist.</p>

    <p class="f4">With body for its object,<br/> with body for its platform,<br/> seeking means of enjoyment,<br/> it may come by growth,<br/> increase,<br/> abundance.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">With the activities for its object,<br/> with the activities for its platform,<br/> seeking a means of enjoyment,<br/> it may come by growth,<br/> increase,<br/> abundance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Were a man, brethren, to declare thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Apart from body,<br/> apart from feeling,<br/> apart from perception,<br/> apart from the <span class="f2 g"><b>[46]</b></span> activities,<br/> I will show forth the coming or the going<br/> or the decease or the rebirth of consciousness,<br/> or the growth or the increase<br/> or the abundance of consciousness" -<br/> to do that were impossible.</p>

    <p class="f4">If lust for body, brethren,<br/> is abandoned by a brother,<br/> by that abandonment of lust<br/> its foothold is cut off.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">If lust for feeling, brethren,<br/> is abandoned by a brother,<br/> by that abandonment of lust<br/> its foothold is cut off.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">If lust for perception, brethren, is abandoned by a brother,<br/> by that abandonment of lust<br/> its foothold is cut off.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">If lust for the activities, brethren, is abandoned by a brother,<br/> by that abandonment of lust<br/> its foothold is cut off.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also, brethren, if lust for the consciousness-element be abandoned by a brother,<br/> by that abandonment of lust<br/> its foothold is cut off.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Without that platform<br/> consciousness has no growth,<br/> it generates no action<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> and is freed:<br/> by freedom it is steady:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> by its steadiness it is happy:<br/> owing to happiness it is not troubled.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being untroubled,<br/> of itself it becomes utterly well,<br/> so that it knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions there is no hereafter."'</p>
