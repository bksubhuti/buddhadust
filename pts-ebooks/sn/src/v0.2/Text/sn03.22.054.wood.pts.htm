    <p><span class="f2">[54]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[46]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are five sorts of seed, brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Root-seed,<br/> trunk-seed,<br/> seed from shoots,<br/> seed from joints,<br/> grain-seed,<br/> making five in all.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, brethren,<br/> that these five sorts of seed are unbroken,<br/> not rotten,<br/> unspoiled by wind and heat,<br/> capable of sprouting,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> and happily planted,<br/> but that <span class="f2 g"><b>[47]</b></span> there is no soil<br/> and no water.</p>

    <p class="f4">Think ye, brethren,<br/> that these five sorts of seed<br/> would come to growth,<br/> increase,<br/> abundance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren,<br/> that these five sorts of seed<br/> are unbroken,<br/> not rotten,<br/> unspoiled by wind and heat,<br/> capable of sprouting,<br/> but not happily planted,<br/> and that there were soil and water.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now would these five sorts of seed<br/> come to growth,<br/> increase,<br/> abundance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Again, brethren,<br/> suppose that these five sorts of seed<br/> are unbroken,<br/> not rotten,<br/> unspoiled by wind and heat,<br/> capable of sprouting,<br/> and happily planted,<br/> and that there is both soil and water.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now would these five sorts of seed<br/> come to growth,<br/> increase,<br/> abundance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"As the earth-element, brethren,<br/> so should the four stations of consciousness be considered.</p>

    <p class="f4">As the water-element, brethren,<br/> so should the lure of lust be considered.</p>

    <p class="f4">As the five sorts of seed, brethren,<br/> so should consciousness and its cause be considered.</p>

    <p class="f4">By attachment to body, brethren,<br/> consciousness,<br/> if it got a standing,<br/> would stand.</p>

    <p class="f4">With body for its object,<br/> with body for its platform,<br/> seeking a means of enjoyment,<br/> it would come by growth,<br/> increase,<br/> abundance.</p>

    <p class="f4">By cleaving to feeling,<br/> brethren,<br/> consciousness,<br/> if it got a standing,<br/> would stand.</p>

    <p class="f4">With feeling for its object,<br/> with feeling for its platform,<br/> seeking a means of enjoyment,<br/> it would come by growth,<br/> increase,<br/> abundance.</p>

    <p class="f4">By cleaving to perception,<br/> brethren,<br/> consciousness,<br/> if it got a standing,<br/> would stand.</p>

    <p class="f4">With perception for its object,<br/> with perception for its platform,<br/> seeking a means of enjoyment,<br/> it would come by growth,<br/> increase,<br/> abundance.</p>

    <p class="f4">By cleaving to the activities,<br/> brethren,<br/> consciousness,<br/> if it got a standing,<br/> would stand.</p>

    <p class="f4">With the activities for its object,<br/> with the activities for its platform,<br/> seeking a means of enjoyment,<br/> it would come by growth,<br/> increase,<br/> abundance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Were a man, brethren, to declare thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Apart from body,<br/> apart from feeling,<br/> apart from perception,<br/> apart from the activities,<br/> I will show forth the coming or the going,<br/> or the decease<br/> or the rebirth of consciousness,<br/> or the growth,<br/> the increase,<br/> the abundance of consciousness -<br/> to do that were impossible.</p>

    <p class="f4">If lust for body, brethren,<br/> is abandoned by a brother,<br/> by that abandonment of lust<br/> its foothold is cut off.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">If lust for feeling, brethren,<br/> is abandoned by a brother,<br/> by that abandonment of lust<br/> its foothold is cut off.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">If lust for perception, brethren, is abandoned by a brother,<br/> by that abandonment of lust<br/> its foothold is cut off.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">If lust for the activities, brethren, is abandoned by a brother,<br/> by that abandonment of lust<br/> its foothold is cut off.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also, brethren, if lust for the consciousness-element be abandoned by a brother,<br/> by that abandonment of lust<br/> its foothold is cut off.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Without that platform<br/> consciousness has no growth,<br/> it generates no action and is freed:<br/> by freedom it is steady:<br/> by its steadiness it is happy:<br/> owing to happiness it is not troubled.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being untroubled,<br/> of itself it becomes utterly well,<br/> so that it knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions there is no hereafter."'</p>
