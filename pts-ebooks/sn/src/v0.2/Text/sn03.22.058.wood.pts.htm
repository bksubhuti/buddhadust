    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Tathāgata, brethren,<br/> who being arahant,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> is a fully enlightened one,<br/> because of disgust at body,<br/> of the fading out of body,<br/> of the ceasing of body,<br/> is called 'freed without grasping,'<br/> 'fully enlightened.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Tathāgata, brethren,<br/> who being arahant,<br/> is a fully enlightened one,<br/> because of disgust at feeling,<br/> of the fading out of feeling,<br/> of the ceasing of feeling,<br/> is called 'freed without grasping,'<br/> 'fully enlightened.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That brother who is freed by insight,<br/> because of disgust at feeling,<br/> of the fading out of feeling,<br/> the ceasing of feeling,<br/> is called 'freed without grasping,'<br/> 'freed by insight.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Tathāgata, brethren,<br/> who being arahant,<br/> is a fully enlightened one,<br/> because of disgust at perception,<br/> of the fading out of perception,<br/> of the ceasing of perception,<br/> is called 'freed without grasping,'<br/> 'fully enlightened.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That brother who is freed by insight,<br/> because of disgust at perception,<br/> of the fading out of perception,<br/> the ceasing of perception,<br/> is called 'freed without grasping,'<br/> 'freed by insight.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Tathāgata, brethren,<br/> who being arahant,<br/> is a fully enlightened one,<br/> because of disgust at the activities,<br/> of the fading out of the activities,<br/> of the ceasing of the activities,<br/> is called 'freed without grasping,'<br/> 'fully enlightened.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Tathāgata, brethren,<br/> who being arahant,<br/> is a fully enlightened one,<br/> because of disgust at the consciousness,<br/> of the fading out of the consciousness,<br/> of the ceasing of the consciousness,<br/> is called 'freed without grasping,'<br/> 'fully enlightened.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein, brethren, what is the distinction,<br/> what is the specific feature,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> what is the difference<br/> between the Tathāgata who,<br/> being arahant,<br/> is a fully enlightened one,<br/> from the brother<br/> who is freed by insight?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord, things are rooted in the Exalted One,<br/> have the Exalted One for their guide<br/> and their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well for us, lord,<br/> if the Exalted One should reveal unto us<br/> the meaning of this saying.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing the Exalted One,<br/> the brethren will bear it in mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then listen, brethren,<br/> and apply your minds closely.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/> replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Tathāgata, brethren,<br/> who, being arahant,<br/> is fully enlightened,<br/> he it is who doth cause a way to arise<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> which had not arisen before;<br/> who doth bring about a way<br/> not brought about before;<br/> who doth proclaim a way<br/> not proclaimed before;<br/> who is the knower of a way,<br/> who understandeth a way,<br/> who is skilled in a way.</p>

    <p class="f4">And now, brethren, his disciples<br/> are wayfarers who follow after him.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That, brethren, is the distinction,<br/> the specific feature<br/> which distinguishes the Tathāgata who,<br/> being arahant,<br/> is fully enlightened,<br/> from the brother<br/> who is freed by insight."</p>
