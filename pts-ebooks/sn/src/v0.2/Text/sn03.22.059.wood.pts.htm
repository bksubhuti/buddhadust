    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">At Benares, in the Deer Park was the occasion<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> (for this discourse).</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time the Exalted One thus addressed the band of five brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Body, brethren, is not the Self.</p>

    <p class="f4">If body, brethren, were the Self,<br/> then body would not be involved in sickness,<br/> and one could say of body:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus let my body be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus let my body not be."</p>

    <p class="f4">But, brethren, inasmuch as body is not the Self,<br/> that is why body is involved in sickness,<br/> and one cannot say of body:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus let my body be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is not the Self.</p>

    <p class="f4">If feeling, brethren, were the Self,<br/> then feeling would not be involved in sickness,<br/> and one could say of feeling:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus let my feeling be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus let my feeling not be."</p>

    <p class="f4">But, brethren, inasmuch as feeling is not the Self,<br/> that is why feeling is involved in sickness,<br/> and one cannot say of feeling:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus let my activities be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus let my activities not be."</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> feels disgust for body,<br/> feels disgust for feeling,<br/> feels disgust for perception,<br/> feels disgust for the activities,<br/> feels disgust for consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">So feeling disgust<br/> he is repelled;<br/> being repelled,<br/> he is freed;<br/> knowledge arises<br/> that in the freed<br/> is the freed thing;<br/> so that he knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth;<br/> lived is the righteous life;<br/> done is my task;<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br/> and the band of five brethren were pleased thereat,<br/> and welcomed what was said by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, by this teaching<br/> thus uttered<br/> the hearts of those five brethren<br/> were freed from the <i>āsavas</i><br/> without grasping.</p>
