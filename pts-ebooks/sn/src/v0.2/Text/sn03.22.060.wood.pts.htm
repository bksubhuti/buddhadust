    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Vesali,<br/> in Great Wood,<br/> at the Hall of the Peaked Gable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Mahāli, the Licchavi,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> came to the Exalted One<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Mahāli, the Licchavi,<br/> thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[61]</b></span> "Lord, Pūraṇa Kassapa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I say there are conditions,<br/> there is cause<br/> for the impurity of beings, Mahāli.</p>
