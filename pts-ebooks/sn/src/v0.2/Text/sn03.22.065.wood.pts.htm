    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine,<br/> so that hearing the doctrine of the Exalted One<br/> I might dwell solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brother, if one be enamoured, he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he be enamoured not, he is released from the evil one."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I understand, Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">I understand, Well-farer!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"But in what way, brother,<br/> do you understand in full<br/> the meaning of what I spoke concisely?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus, lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">Enamoured of body,<br/> one is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/> he is released from the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Enamoured of feeling,<br/> he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/> he is released from the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Enamoured of perception,<br/> he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/> he is released from the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Enamoured of the activities,<br/> he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/> he is released from the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Enamoured of consciousness,<br/> he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/> he is released from the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, lord, is how I understand in full<br/> what was concisely spoken by the Exalted One."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well have you understood in full<br/> the meaning of what I spoke concisely.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is indeed by enamoured body,<br/> one is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/> he is released from the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Enamoured of feeling,<br/> he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/> he is released from the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Enamoured of perception,<br/> he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/> he is released from the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Enamoured of the activities,<br/> he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/> he is released from the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Enamoured of consciousness,<br/> he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/> he is released from the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">And so should be understood in full<br/> what I said concisely.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon that brother gladly heard the words of the Exalted One<br/> and welcomed them,<br/> and he rose from his seat,<br/> saluted the Exalted One<br/> and departed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereafter that brother,<br/> dwelling solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> in no long time<br/> attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br/> to win which the clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless,<br/> so that in that very life<br/> of himself<br/> he fully understood it,<br/> realized it<br/> and abode therein,<br/> and knew:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions there is no hereafter.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So that brother was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
