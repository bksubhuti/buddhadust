    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine,<br/> so that hearing the doctrine of the Exalted One<br/> I might dwell solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring."</p>

    <p class="f4">"For that which is suffering, brother, you must put away desire."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I understand, Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">I understand, Well-farer!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"But how, brother, do you understand in full<br/> that which I said concisely?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Body, lord, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">I must put away desire for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Feeling, lord, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">I must put away desire for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Perception, lord, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">I must put away desire for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">"The activities, lord, are suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">I must put away desire for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Consciousness, lord, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">I must put away desire for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how I understand in full<br/> what was concisely spoken by the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed do you understand in full<br/> the meaning of what I said concisely.</p>

    <p class="f4">Body, brother, is indeed suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">You must put away desire for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Feeling, brother, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">You must put away desire for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Perception, brother, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">You must put away desire for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">"The activities, brother, are suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">You must put away desire for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Consciousness, brother, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">You must put away desire for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how, brother, the meaning of what I said concisely<br/> is to be understood in full."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon that brother gladly heard the words of the Exalted One<br/> and welcomed them,<br/> and he rose from his seat,<br/> saluted the Exalted One<br/> and departed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereafter that brother,<br/> dwelling solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> in no long time<br/> attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br/> to win which the clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless,<br/> so that in that very life<br/> of himself<br/> he fully understood it,<br/> realized it<br/> and abode therein,<br/> and knew:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions there is no hereafter.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So that brother was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
