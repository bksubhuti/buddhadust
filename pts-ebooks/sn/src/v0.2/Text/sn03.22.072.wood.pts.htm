    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/> In Jeta Grove,<br/> at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Surādha came to the Exalted One,<br/> and saluting him,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the venerable Surādha thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"How in him who knows,<br/> how in him who sees, lord,<br/> in this body with its consciousness,<br/> and likewise in all external objects,<br/> has mind gone away from all ideas of 'I' and 'mine,'<br/> and has passed beyond the ways of conceit<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> and is utterly liberated?'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever material object, Surādha,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> one regards thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the Self of me' -</p>

    <p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br/> by right insight.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever feeling, Surādha,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> one regards thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the Self of me' -</p>

    <p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br/> by right insight.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever perception, Surādha,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> one regards thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the Self of me' -</p>

    <p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br/> by right insight.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever activities, Surādha,<br/> be they past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> one regards thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the Self of me' -</p>

    <p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br/> by right insight.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever consciousness, Surādha,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> one regards thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the Self of me' -</p>

    <p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br/> by right insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Surādha,<br/> in him who knows,<br/> in him who sees, lord,<br/> in this body with its consciousness,<br/> and likewise in all external objects,<br/> has mind gone away from all ideas of 'I' and 'mine,'<br/> and has passed beyond the ways of conceit<br/> and is utterly liberated."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Surādha gladly heard the words of the Exalted One<br/> and welcomed them,<br/> and he rose from his seat,<br/> saluted the Exalted One<br/> and departed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereafter the venerable Surādha,<br/> dwelling solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> in no long time<br/> attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br/> to win which the clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless,<br/> so that in that very life<br/> of himself<br/> he fully understood it,<br/> realized it<br/> and abode therein,<br/> and knew:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions there is no hereafter.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Surādha was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
