    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/> In Jeta Grove,<br/> at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is not the Self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/> that am not I,<br/> that is not the Self of me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/> as they really are,<br/> by right insight.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is not the Self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/> that am not I,<br/> that is not the Self of me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/> as they really are,<br/> by right insight.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is not the Self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/> that am not I,<br/> that is not the Self of me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/> as they really are,<br/> by right insight.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is not the Self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/> that am not I,<br/> that is not the Self of me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/> as they really are,<br/> by right insight.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/> that is not the Self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/> that am not I,<br/> that is not the Self of me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/> as they really are,<br/> by right insight.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> feels disgust at body,<br/> feels disgust at feeling,<br/> feels disgust at perception,<br/> feels disgust at activities<br/> feels disgust at consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling disgust<br/> he is repelled:<br/> by repulsion he is released;<br/> by that release<br/> set free,<br/> knowledge arises:</p>

    <p class="f4">'In the freed man<br/> is the free thing'</p>

    <p class="f4">and he knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth;<br/> lived is the righteous life;<br/> done is the task;<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Throughout the seven abodes, brethren,<br/> up to the highest becoming,<br/> these are the topmost,<br/> these are the best in all the world, -<br/> these Arahants."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>
