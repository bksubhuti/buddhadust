    <p><span class="f2">[84]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/> In Jeta Grove,<br/> at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The lion, brethren,<br/> king of beasts,<br/> at eventide comes forth from his lair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having come forth from his lair<br/> he stretches<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> himself.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having done so<br/> he surveys the four quarters.</p>

    <p class="f4">Surveying the four quarters<br/> he utters thrice his lion's roar.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thrice having uttered his lion's roar<br/> he sallies forth on his round.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever brute creatures,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> brethren,<br/> hear the sound of the roar of the lion,<br/> king of beasts,<br/> for the most part are afraid,<br/> fall a quaking and a trembling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Those that dwell in holes seek them;<br/> water-dwellers make for the water;<br/> forest-dwellers enter the forest;<br/> birds mount into the air.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, brethren, whatsoever royal elephants<br/> at royal seats,<br/> in villages,<br/> in towns<br/> are tethered with stout leathern bonds,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[71]</b></span> burst and rend those bonds asunder,<br/> voiding excrements<br/> and run to and fro<br/> for very fear.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus potent, brethren, is the lion,<br/> king of beasts,<br/> over brute creatures;<br/> of such might,<br/> of such power is he.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren,<br/> when a Tathāgata ariseth in the world,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> an Arahant,<br/> fully awakened,<br/> perfect in lore and conduct,<br/> well-farer,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One, -<br/> thus he teaches the Norm:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Such and such is body,<br/> its arising and its ceasing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such and such is feeling,<br/> its arising and its ceasing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such and such is perception,<br/> its arising and its ceasing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such and such the activities,<br/> their arising and their ceasing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such and such is consciousness,<br/> its arising and its ceasing."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, brethren, whatsoever devas there be,<br/> long-living,<br/> beautiful<br/> and blissful,<br/> long established in lofty palaces,<br/> when they hear the Norm-teaching of the Tathāgata,<br/> for the most part<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> they become fearful,<br/> fall a trembling and a quaking,<br/> (and they say):</p>

    <p class="f4">'It seems, friends,<br/> that impermanent are we,<br/> and permanent we deemed ourselves.</p>

    <p class="f4">Unstable are we, it seems,<br/> and stable we deemed ourselves.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not to last, friends, it seems are we,<br/> and lasting we deemed ourselves.</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, friends, are we impermanent,<br/> unstable,<br/> not to last,<br/> prisoned in a person.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus potent, brethren, is the Tathāgata<br/> over devas and their world;<br/> of such might,<br/> of such power is he.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So spake the Exalted One,<br/> and when the Well-farer had thus spoken,<br/> the Teacher added this further:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[72]</b></span> "When the 'waked by mighty wisdom sets the Norm-wheel rolling on, -<br/> Teacher he without a rival of the devas and the world -<br/> Teacher that the person<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> ceases and the person comes to be,<br/> And the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to calming of all woe, -<br/> Devas, they who live for ages, beauteous, of great renown,<br/> Like the beasts before the lion, fall a-trembling, are afraid:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/> For they have not conquered self-hood. 'Transient, friends,' say they 'are we,'<br/> When they hear the Arahant's words, of him who hath won liberty."</p>
