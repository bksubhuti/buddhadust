    <p class="f4">Affected by touch of cold and heat,<br/> of hunger and <span class="f2 g"><b>[73]</b></span> thirst,<br/> of gnats,<br/> mosquitoes,<br/> wind<br/> and sun<br/> and snakes.</p>

    <p class="f4">One perceives, brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Perceives what?</p>

    <p class="f4">Perceives blue-green,<br/> perceives yellow,<br/> or red,<br/> or white.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is why, brethren,<br/> the word 'activities-compound' is used.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what compound do they compose?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is body that they compose<br/> into a compound of body.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It is the activities that they compose<br/> into an activities-compound;</p>

    <p class="f4">It is consciousness that they compose<br/> into a consciousness-compound.</p>

    <p class="f4">They compose a compound, brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore the word '(activities)-compound' is used.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[74]</b></span> And why, brethren, do ye say 'consciousness'?</p>

    <p class="f4">One is conscious, brethren.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore the word 'consciousness' is used.</p>

    <p class="f4">Conscious of what?</p>

    <p class="f4">Of (flavours) sour or bitter;<br/> acrid or sweet;<br/> alkaline or non-alkaline;<br/> saline or non-saline.</p>

    <p class="f4">One is conscious, brethren.</p>

He misconstrues these various contacts not as referring to this life, but as 'informing' creatures in other spheres - <i>e.g.,</i> the cold hell, the hungry-ghost world, etc. He regards 'wind' as referring to flatulence! Etymologically <i>rūpaṁ</i> is not connected with <i>ruppati.</i> <i>This</i> is from <i>rup</i> <i>(lup)</i> to damage; <i>that</i> is probably from <i>varp,</i> shape.

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Text <i>vediyanti,</i> probably an error for sing. <i>vediyati</i> or <i>vedayati.</i> <i>Comy.</i> has both forms and comments on them, but mentions no plural.
