    <p><span class="f2">[94]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[80]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Kosambī in Ghosita Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, robing himself at early dawn and taking bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he had been his rounds for alms in Kosambī, on his return from begging he ate his meal, and setting his own bed in order, he took bowl and robe, and without calling his attendants or giving notice to the Order of brethren, alone and unattended, went forth a-wandering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a certain brother, not long after the Exalted One had gone out, came to the venerable Ānanda and addressed him <span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend Ānanda, the Exalted One has set his own bed in order, taken bowl and robe, and without calling his attendants or giving notice to the Order of brethren, alone and unattended, has gone forth a-wandering."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, when the Exalted One has set his own bed in order, taken bowl and robe, and without calling his attendants or giving notice to the Order of brethren, alone and unattended, has gone forth a-wandering, at such a time the Exalted One wishes to dwell alone.</p>

    <p class="f4">At such a time the Exalted One is not to be followed by anyone."</p>

    <p class="f4">So it came to pass that the Exalted One went wandering on and came to Pārileyya[ka], and there at Pārileyya[ka] the Exalted One dwelt at the foot of a lucky sal tree.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of brethren came to the venerable Ānanda and held friendly converse with him, exchanged the courtesies of friendly talk and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, those brethren thus addressed the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Tis a long time, friend Ānanda, since we had pious talk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> face to face with the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">We desire, friend Ānanda, to hear a pious talk face to face with the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Ānanda went along with those brethren to Pārileyya to the lucky sal-tree where the Exalted One was dwelling, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As they thus sat, the Exalted One instructed, calmed, aroused and composed those brethren with pious talk.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion this train of thought arose in a certain brother:</p>

    <p class="f4">"How knowing, how seeing, I wonder, can one without delay destroy the āsavas?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, with his own thought reading the thought of that brother's mind, thus spake unto the brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, I have defined<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> and taught you the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have defined and taught you the four stations of mindfulness, likewise the right efforts, the four bases of magic power, the five controlling powers, the five strengths, the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have defined and taught you the Ariyan Eight- <span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span> fold Path.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, brethren, have I defined and taught you the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">And yet, brethren, in spite of this, in the mind of a certain brother here there has arisen this train of thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"How knowing, how seeing, I wonder, can one without delay destroy the <i>āsavas</i>?"</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, indeed, brethren, can one do so without delay?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the untaught many-folk,<br/> who discern not those that are Ariyans,<br/> who are unskilled in the Ariyan Norm,<br/> untrained in the Ariyan Norm,<br/> who discern not the worthy ones,<br/> who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine, -<br/> such regard body as the Self.</p>

    <p class="f4">This regarding is an activity,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> and this activity -<br/> how does it result,<br/> how does it arise,<br/> how is it born<br/> and how produced?</p>
