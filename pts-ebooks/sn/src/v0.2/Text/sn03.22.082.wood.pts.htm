    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī in East Park at the storied house of Migāra's mother<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> with a great gathering of the Order of brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion, - it was the Sabbath, the fifteenth day of the moon, on full-moon night, - the Exalted One was seated in the open air surrounded by the Order of brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother, rising from his seat, and drawing his outer robe over one shoulder, bowed before the Exalted One with folded hands and thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, I would fain question the Exalted One on a certain point, if the Exalted One grants permission and would give an answer to my question?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then sit down where you are, brother, and ask what you will."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Are these the five grasping-groups, lord, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">The grasping body-group,<br/> the grasping feeling-group,<br/> the grasping perception-group,<br/> the grasping activities-group<br/> the grasping consciousness-group?</p>

    <p class="f4">"That is so, brother.</p>

    <p class="f4">"No indeed, brother,<br/> this same grasping<br/> is not those five grasping-groups,<br/> nor yet is it something apart from those five groups.</p>

    <p class="f4">"It may be so, brother,"<br/> replied the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, brother, one thinks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'May I be of such a body in future time:<br/> may I have such feeling,<br/> such perception,<br/> such activities,<br/> such consciousness in future time."</p>
