    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta Grove, at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Tissa,<br/> nephew to the Exalted One's father,<br/> thus spoke to a number of brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Truly, friends, my body has become as if drugged;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> the four quarters are become dim to my eyes,<br/> and the teachings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> are no longer clear to me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sloth and torpor possess my heart:<br/> joyless to me is the righteous life,<br/> and I waver in the teachings."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon a number of brethren went to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, those brethren said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, the venerable Tissa,<br/> nephew to the Exalted One's father,<br/> speaks thus to a number of brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Truly, friends, my body has become as if drugged;<br/> the four quarters are become dim to my eyes,<br/> and the teachings are no longer clear to me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sloth and torpor possess my heart:<br/> joyless to me is the righteous life,<br/> and I waver in the teachings."</p>

    <p class="f4">At that, the Exalted One called to a certain brother:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come thou, brother,<br/> and in my name<br/> bid hither brother Tissa, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friend Tissa, the Master would speak to you.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/> said that brother in reply to the Exalted <span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span> One,<br/> and went to the venerable Tissa and said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend Tissa, the Master would speak to you."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, brother,"<br/> said the venerable Tissa in reply to that brother,<br/> and came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/> the Exalted One thus spake unto the venerable Tissa:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is it true, as they say, Tissa,<br/> that you said this to a number of brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Truly, friends, my body has become as if drugged;<br/> the four quarters are become dim to my eyes,<br/> and the teachings are no longer clear to me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sloth and torpor possess my heart:<br/> joyless to me is the righteous life,<br/> and I waver in the teachings."</p>

    <p class="f4">The 'thick forest,' Tissa,<br/> is a name for ignorance.</p>

    <p class="f4">The 'great marshy swamp,' Tissa,<br/> is a name for the feeling-desires.</p>

    <p class="f4">The 'steep precipice,' Tissa,<br/> is a name for vexation and despair.</p>
