    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Vesalī,<br/> in Great Grove, at the Hall of the Gabled House.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time the venerable Anurādha<br/> was staying not far from the Exalted One<br/> in a forest hut.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of wandering heretics came to the venerable Anurādha,<br/> greeted him<br/> and exchanged the courtesies of civil words<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/> those heretic Wanderers said to the venerable Anurādha:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend Anurādha, a Tathāgata,<br/> a superman,<br/> one of the best of men,<br/> a winner of the highest gain,<br/> is proclaimed in [one of] these four ways:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A Tathāgata comes to be after death;<br/> or he does not come to be after death;<br/> or he both comes to be and does not come to be after death;<br/> or he neither comes to be nor comes not to be after death.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Upon this the venerable Anuradha<br/> said to those heretic Wanderers:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, a Tathāgata,<br/> a superman,<br/> one of the best of men,<br/> a winner of the highest gain,<br/> is spoken of in other than those four ways,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A Tathāgata comes to be after death;<br/> or he does not come to be after death;<br/> or he both comes to be and does not come to be after death;<br/> or he neither comes to be nor comes not to be after death.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Upon this those heretic Wanderers<br/> said of the venerable Anurādha:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This brother must be a novice,<br/> not long ordained.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, if he is an elder,<br/> he is an ignorant fool."</p>

    <p class="f4">So those heretic Wanderers,<br/> having thus abused the venerable Anurādha,<br/> by calling him 'novice'<br/> and 'fool,'<br/> rose up and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Anurādha,<br/> not long after those <span class="f2 g"><b>[100]</b></span> heretic Wanderers were gone,<br/> thought thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'If these heretic Wanderers were to put me a further question,<br/> how, in answering,<br/> should I tell them the views of the Exalted One,<br/> without misrepresenting the Exalted One<br/> by stating an untruth?</p>

    <p class="f4">How should I answer<br/> in accordance with his teaching,<br/> so that no one who agrees with his teaching<br/> and follows his views<br/> might incur reproach?</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Anurādha<br/> went to the Exalted One and sat down.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side<br/> the venerable Anurādha thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am staying here, lord,<br/> in a forest hut<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a number of heretic Wanderers came to me<br/> greeted me<br/> and exchanged the courtesies of civil words<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/> those heretic Wanderers said to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friend Anurādha,<br/> a Tathāgata,<br/> a superman,<br/> one of the best of men,<br/> a winner of the highest gain,<br/> is proclaimed in [one of] these four ways:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wherefore, Anurādha, he who thus sees<br/> conceives disgust at body,<br/> at feeling,<br/> at perception,<br/> at the activities,<br/> at consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being disgusted<br/> he is repelled by them;<br/> by that repulsion he is released;<br/> by that release he is set free;<br/> knowledge arises:<br/> in the freed man is the freed thing,<br/> and he knows:</p>
