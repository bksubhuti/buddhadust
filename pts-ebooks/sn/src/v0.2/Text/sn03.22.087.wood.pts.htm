    <p><span class="f2">[119]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[101]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha in Great Grove,<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-Ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion the venerable Vakkali was staying in the Potter's shed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> being sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> stricken with a sore disease.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Vakkali called to his attendants, saying:<br/> 'Come hither, friends!<br/> Go ye to the Exalted One, and,<br/> in my name worshipping at the feet of the Exalted One,<br/> say unto <span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span> him:<br/> "Lord, the brother Vakkali is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> stricken with a sore disease.<br/> He worships at the feet of the Exalted one."</p>

    <p class="f4">And thus do ye say:<br/> "Well were it, lord,<br/> if the Exalted One would visit brother Vakkali,<br/> out of compassion for him."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, friend,'<br/> replied those brethren to the venerable Vakkali,<br/> and went to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him and sat down at one side.<br/> So seated those brethren said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, the brother Vakkali is sick<br/> afflicted,<br/> stricken with a sore disease.<br/> He worships at the feet of the Exalted one.<br/> Well were it if the Exalted One<br/> would visit brother Vakkali<br/> out of compassion for him.'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One consented by his silence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One robed himself,<br/> and taking bowl and robe,<br/> went to visit the venerable Vakkali.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Vakkali saw the Exalted One coming,<br/> while yet he was afar off,<br/> and on seeing him<br/> he stirred upon his bed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to the venerable Vakkali:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Enough, Vakkali!<br/> Stir not on your bed!<br/> There are these seats made ready.<br/> I will sit there.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Exalted One sat down<br/> and said to the venerable Vakkkali:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, Vakkali, I hope you are bearing up.<br/> I hope you are enduring.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> Do your pains abate and not increase?<br/> Are there signs of their abating and not increasing?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'No, lord, I am not bearing up.<br/> I am not enduring.<br/> Strong pains come upon me.<br/> They do not abate.<br/> There is no sign of their abating,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> but of their increasing.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span> 'Have you any doubt, Vakkali?<br/> Have you any remorse?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Indeed, lord, I have no little doubt.<br/> I have no little remorse.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Have you not anything, Vakkali,<br/> wherein to reproach yourself<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> as to morals?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Nay, lord, there is nothing wherein I reproach myself as to morals.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Then, Vakkali, if that is so,<br/> you must have some worry,<br/> you must have something you regret.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'For a long time, lord,<br/> I have been longing to set eyes on the Exalted One,<br/> but I had not strength enough in this body<br/> to come to see the Exalted one.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Hush, Vakkali!<br/> What is there in seeing this vile body of mine?<br/> He who seeth the Norm, Vakkali,<br/> he seeth me:<br/> he who seeth me, Vakkali,<br/> he seeth the Norm.<br/> Verily, seeing the Norm, Vakkali,<br/> one sees me:<br/> seeing me,<br/> one sees the Norm.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">As to this what think you, Vakkali?<br/> Is body permanent or impermanent?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Impermanent, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is feeling permanent or impermanent?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Impermanent, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is perception permanent or impermanent?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Impermanent, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Are the activities permanent or impermanent?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Impermanent, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is consciousness permanent, or impermanent?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Impermanent, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Wherefore, Vakkali, he who thus seeth feels disgust for body, feels disgust for feeling, for perception, for the activities, feels disgust for consciousness.<br/> So feeling disgust he is repelled;<br/> being repelled, he is freed;<br/> knowledge arises that in the freed<br/> is the freed thing;<br/> so that he knows:<br/> "destroyed is rebirth;<br/> lived is the righteous life;<br/> done is my task;<br/> for life in these conditions there is no hereafter."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/> having thus taught the venerable Vakkali this lesson,<br/> rose up and went away to Vulture's Peak.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of the Exalted One,<br/> the venerable Vakkali called to his attendants:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come ye hither, friends.<br/> Lift up my bed and go to Black Rock<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/> on the slope of Seers' Hill.<br/> How should one of my sort<br/> think to make an end within a house?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[104]</b></span> 'Even so, friend,<br/> replied those brethren to the venerable Vakkali,<br/> lifted up the bed and carried him to Black Rock<br/> on the slope of Seer's Hill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One spent the rest of that day and the night on Vulture's Peak.<br/> Then when the night was waning<br/> two devas of exceeding beauty<br/> caused the whole of Vulture's Peak to be lit up,<br/> and came to the Exalted One<br/> and stood there at one side.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">So standing<br/> one of those devas thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, the brother Vakkali is bent on release.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the other deva said to the Exalted One:<br/> 'Surely, lord, he will win the utter release.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake those devas.<br/> So saying they saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/> and vanished there and then.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One,<br/> when that night was spent,<br/> called to the brethren:—</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come hither, brethren.<br/> Go ye to brother Vakkali, and say to him:<br/> "Friend Vakkali,<br/> listen to the words of the Exalted One<br/> and of two devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">This night, friend,<br/> when night was waning<br/> two devas of exceeding beauty<br/> caused the whole of Vulture's Peak to be lit up,<br/> and came to the Exalted One<br/> and stood there at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So standing<br/> one of those devas thus addressed the Exalted One:<br/> 'Lord, the brother Vakkali is bent on release.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the other deva said to the Exalted One:<br/> 'Surely, lord, he will win the utter release.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And as to that, friend Vakkali,<br/> the Exalted One says this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Fear not, Vakkali.<br/> Fear not, Vakkali.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/> Your dying will not be evil.<br/> Your ending will not be evil.'"'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord,'<br/> replied those brethren to the Exalted One,<br/> and went to the venerable Vakkali<br/> and thus said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Listen, friend Vakkali,<br/> to the word of the Exalted One<br/> and of two devas.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[105]</b></span> Then the venerable Vekkali called to his attendants saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come hither, friends.<br/> Lift me off from the bed.<br/> How should one of my sort<br/> think fit to hear the message of the Exalted One<br/> while sitting on a high seat?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, friend,'<br/> replied those brethren,<br/> and lifted him off from the bed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then those brethren said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This night, friend,<br/> when night was waning<br/> two devas of exceeding beauty<br/> caused the whole of Vulture's Peak to be lit up,<br/> and came to the Exalted One<br/> and stood there at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So standing<br/> one of those devas thus addressed the Exalted One:<br/> 'Lord, the brother Vakkali is bent on release.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the other deva said to the Exalted One:<br/> 'Surely, lord, he will win the utter release.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And as to that, friend Vakkali,<br/> the Exalted One says this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Fear not, Vakkali.<br/> Fear not, Vakkali.<br/> Your dying will not be evil.<br/> Your ending will not be evil.'"'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Wherefore, friends,<br/> do ye in my name<br/> worship at the feet of the Exalted One and say:<br/> "Lord, brother Vakkali is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> stricken with a sore disease.<br/> He worships at the feet of the Exalted One<br/> and thus speaks:<br/> 'Body is impermanent, lord,<br/> I doubt it not.<br/> Whatsoever, lord, is impermanent,<br/> that is woe;<br/> I doubt it not.<br/> What is impermanent and woeful<br/> and of the nature to fade away,<br/> — for that I have no desire,<br/> no lust,<br/> no love.<br/> I doubt it not.<br/> Feeling, lord,<br/> perception,<br/> the activities,<br/> consciousness is impermanent and woeful<br/> and of the nature to fade away,<br/> — for that I have no desire,<br/> no lust,<br/> no love.<br/> I have no doubt of that.'"'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, friend,'<br/> replied those brethren to the venerable Vakkali<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Vakkali,<br/> not long after the departure of those brethren,<br/> drew a knife (and slew himself).<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now those brethren went to the Exalted One and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, brother Vakkali is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> stricken with a sore disease.<br/> He worships at the feet of the Exalted One<br/> and thus speaks:<br/> 'Body is impermanent, lord,<br/> I doubt it not.<br/> Whatsoever, lord, is impermanent,<br/> that is woe;<br/> I doubt it not.<br/> What is impermanent and woeful<br/> and of the nature to fade away,<br/> — for that I have no desire,<br/> no lust,<br/> no love.<br/> I doubt it not.<br/> Feeling, lord,<br/> perception,<br/> the activities,<br/> consciousness is impermanent and woeful<br/> and of the nature to fade away,<br/> — for that I have no desire,<br/> no lust,<br/> no love.<br/> I have no doubt of that.'"'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said to the brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Let us go hence, brethren,<br/> to Black Rock,<br/> on the slope of Seers' Hill,<br/> since the clansman Vakkali hath slain himself.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord,'<br/> replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One went<br/> with a number of the brethren<br/> to <span class="f3"><i>[106]</i></span> Black Rock<br/> on the slope of Seers' Hill.</p>

    <p class="f4">And from afar the Exalted One saw the venerable Vakkali<br/> lying on the bed<br/> with his shoulder twisted round.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time a smoky cloud,<br/> a mass of darkness<br/> was moving to the east,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/> was moving to the west,<br/> to the north,<br/> to the south,<br/> and up and down<br/> and to the points between.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said to the brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Do ye see, brethren,<br/> yonder smoky cloud,<br/> yonder mass of darkness<br/> moving east and west,<br/> to north and south,<br/> and up and down<br/> and to the points between?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Brethren, that is Mara, the evil one.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is searching for the consciousness<br/> of Vakkali, the clansman, saying:<br/> "Where is the consciousness of Vakkali, the clansman, stationed anew?"</p>

    <p class="f4">But, brethren,<br/> with consciousness not stationed anew anywhere,<br/> Vakkali the clansman is utterly well.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup><i>Comy.</i> says, after keeping the rainy season, he had come to see the Master, was taken ill on the way and removed in a litter to the Potter's shed or workshop. According to <i>Thag. Comy.</i> he suffered from cramps owing to insufficient food.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Samadhosi</i> (from <i>dhunati</i>), elsewhere <i>samañcopi.</i> Some say he shook the bed owing to the violence of his fever, but <i>C.</i> says, 'out of reverence' he tried to rise to salute the Master; and adds that, in the Buddha's time, a bhikkhu always had a seat ready in case the Master paid a visit.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Udānā</i> (<i>Soṇathera-vagga,</i> 17, 46, 59). <i>Comy.</i> explains the phrase &#160; (sometimes mistranslated 'have you food enough?') in this way.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Paṭikkam'osānaṅ paññāyati. Comy.,</i> however, interprets <i>(paṭikkamo) sānaṅ as etāsaṅ (vedanānaṅ);</i> lit.: 'is the end of their coming on in sight?'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>Cf. Buddh. Psych.</i> 28. Here <i>attā</i> is the equivalent of our 'conscience.'</p>

As often happens in the <i>Tipiṭaka,</i> the same story is told of different persons either in ignorance or to preserve the traditional framework free from too many details. Thus the introductory part of this story is a stock passage for describing the sick and their visiting. In the <i>Thag. Comy.</i> and <i>Dhp. A.</i> versions, Vakkali does not 'use the knife,' but rises up into the air at the call of the Master and attains arahantship on the way by an effort of self-control.</p>

The ethics of the deed are not discussed by <i>Comy.,</i> who says the elder was conceited and blind to his remaining faults; thought he was <i>khīnāsavo</i> and might rid himself of the bodily pain. However, the pain of the knife was such that, in the very moment of dying, realizing his state of <i>puthujjano</i> as imperfect, he made a great effort to attain and did so before actual death. <i>Comy.</i> adds, 'he died lying on his right side, as arahants generally do (the traditional posture of the Buddha, "on his right side, like a lion lying"), and in a decent posture.'</p>
