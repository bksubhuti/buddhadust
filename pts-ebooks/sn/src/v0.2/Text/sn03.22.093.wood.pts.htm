    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose a stream, brethren,<br/> a mountain-torrent,<br/> down-drawing,<br/> rising from afar,<br/> swift-flowing,<br/> and on both its banks are growing<br/> grasses which overhang the stream,<br/> kusa grass there might be that overhangs,<br/> reeds and creepers<br/> and over-hanging shrubs;<br/> and a man is swept away by that stream<br/> and clutches at the grasses,<br/> but they might break away,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> and owing to that<br/> he might come by his destruction.</p>

    <p class="f4">He might clutch at the kusa grass,<br/> at the reeds,<br/> at the creepers;<br/> he might clutch at the shrubs,<br/> but they might break away,<br/> and owing to that he might come by his destruction.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren,<br/> the untaught many=folk,<br/> who discerns not those who are Ariyans;<br/> who is unskilled in the Ariyan Norm,<br/> untrained in the Ariyan Norm;<br/> who discerns not the worthy ones,<br/> who is unskilled in the worthy Norm,<br/> untrained in the worthy Norm,<br/> regard the body as the self,<br/> or the self as having body,<br/> or the body as being in the self,<br/> or the self as being in the body.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Then body breaks away,<br/> and owing to that<br/> they come by their destruction.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard feeling as the self,<br/> or the self as having feeling,<br/> or feeling as being in the self,<br/> or the self as being in feeling.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Then feeling breaks away,<br/> and owing to that<br/> they come by their destruction.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard perception as the self,<br/> or the self as having perception,<br/> or perception as being in the self,<br/> or the self as being in perception.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Then perception breaks away,<br/> and owing to that<br/> they come by their destruction.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard the activities as the self,<br/> or the self as having the activities,<br/> or the activities as being in the self,<br/> or the self as being in the activities.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the activities break away,<br/> and owing to that<br/> they come by their destruction.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard consciousness as the self,<br/> or the self as having consciousness,<br/> or consciousness as being in the self,<br/> or the self as being in consciousness.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Then consciousness breaks away,<br/> and owing to that<br/> they come by their destruction.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now as to that, what think you, brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> unstable in nature,<br/> is it right to regard it thus:</p>
