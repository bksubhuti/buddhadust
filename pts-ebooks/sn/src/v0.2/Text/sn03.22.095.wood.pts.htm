    <p><span class="f2">[140]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[118]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Ayojjhāya,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> on the bank of the river Ganges.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just as if, brethren,<br/> this river Ganges should carry down<br/> a huge lump of foam,<br/> and a keen-sighted man should see it,<br/> observe it<br/> and look close into its nature.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing it,<br/> observing <span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span>  it<br/> and looking close into its nature,<br/> he would find it empty,<br/> he would find it unsubstantial,<br/> he would find it without essence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br/> could there be<br/> in a lump of foam?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren, whatsoever body,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> subtle or gross,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> which a brother sees,<br/> observes<br/> and looks close into its nature,<br/> he so seeing,<br/> observing<br/> and looking into the nature of it,<br/> would find it empty,<br/> he would find it unsubstantial,<br/> he would find it without essence.</p>

    <p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br/> could there be<br/> in a body?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, brethren, in autumn time<br/> when the sky god rains down big drops,<br/> a bubble rises on the water<br/> and straight-away bursts,<br/> and a keen-sighted man should see it,<br/> observe it,<br/> look close into its nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing it,<br/> observing it<br/> and looking close into its nature,<br/> he would find it empty,<br/> he would find it unsubstantial,<br/> he would find it without essence.</p>

    <p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br/> could there be<br/> in a bubble on the water?</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren, whatsoever feeling,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> subtle or gross,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> which a brother sees,<br/> observes<br/> and looks close into its nature,<br/> he so seeing,<br/> observing<br/> and looking into the nature of it,<br/> would find it empty,<br/> he would find it unsubstantial,<br/> he would find it without essence.</p>

    <p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br/> could there be<br/> in feeling?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if, brethren,<br/> in the last month of the dry season<br/> at high noontide<br/> there should be a mirage,<br/> and a keen-sighted man should see it,<br/> observe it,<br/> look close into its nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing it,<br/> observing it<br/> and looking close into its nature,<br/> he would find it empty,<br/> he would find it unsubstantial,<br/> he would find it without essence.</p>

    <p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br/> could there be<br/> in a mirage?</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren, whatsoever perception,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> subtle or gross,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> which a brother sees,<br/> observes<br/> and looks close into its nature,<br/> he so seeing,<br/> observing<br/> and looking into the nature of it,<br/> would find it empty,<br/> he would find it unsubstantial,<br/> he would find it without essence.</p>

    <p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br/> could there be<br/> in perception?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, brethren, suppose a man should roam about<br/> in need of heart of wood,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> searching for heart of wood,<br/> looking for heart of wood,<br/> and taking a sharp axe<br/> should enter a forest.</p>

    <p class="f4">There he sees a mighty plantain-trunk,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> straight up,<br/> new grown,<br/> of towering height.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He cuts it down at the root.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span> Having cut it down at the root,<br/> he chops it off at the top.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having chopped it off at the top,<br/> he peels off the outer skin.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When he peels off the outer skin,<br/> he finds no pith<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> inside,<br/> much less does he find heart of wood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then suppose a keen-sighted man sees it,<br/> observes it,<br/> looks into the nature of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing it,<br/> observing it<br/> and looking close into its nature,<br/> he would find it empty,<br/> he would find it unsubstantial,<br/> he would find it without essence.</p>

    <p class="f4">What essence, brethren, could there be<br/> in a plantain-trunk?</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren, whatsoever activities,<br/> be they past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> subtle or gross,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> which a brother sees,<br/> observes<br/> and looks close into their nature,<br/> he so seeing,<br/> observing<br/> and looking into the nature of them,<br/> would find them empty,<br/> he would find them unsubstantial,<br/> he would find them without essence.</p>

    <p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br/> could there be<br/> in the activities?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, brethren, suppose a juggler<br/> or a juggler's apprentice<br/> should spread a glamour<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> on the high road,<br/> and a keen-sighted man should see it,<br/> observe it,<br/> look close into the nature of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing it,<br/> observing it<br/> and looking close into its nature,<br/> he would find it empty,<br/> he would find it unsubstantial,<br/> he would find it without essence.</p>

    <p class="f4">What essence, brethren, could there be<br/> in a glamour?</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, brethren, whatsoever consciousness,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> subtle or gross,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> which a brother sees,<br/> observes<br/> and looks close into its nature,<br/> he so seeing,<br/> observing<br/> and looking into the nature of it,<br/> would find it empty,<br/> he would find it unsubstantial,<br/> he would find it without essence.</p>

    <p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br/> could there be in consciousness?</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren, he who thus sees<br/> conceives disgust at body,<br/> at feeling,<br/> at perception,<br/> at the activities,<br/> at consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being disgusted<br/> he is repelled by them;<br/> by that repulsion he is released;<br/> by that release he is set free;<br/> knowledge arises:<br/> in the freed man is the freed thing,<br/> and he knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth;<br/> lived is the righteous life;<br/> done is the task;<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">When the Well-Farer had thus spoken,<br/> the Teacher added this further:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Like to a ball of foam this body is:<br/> Like to a bubble blown the feelings are:<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span> Like to a mirage unsubstantial<br/> Perception: pithless as a plantain-trunk<br/> The activities: a phantom, consciousness.<br/> Thus hath declared the Kinsman of the Sun.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">However one doth contemplate (this mass)<br/> And thoroughly investigate its form, -<br/> To him, so seeing, empty, void it is.<br/> Beginning with this body first of all: -<br/> By his rich subtle wisdom<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> it is shown.<br/> 'Reft of three things, life, heat and consciousness,<br/> Behold it thrown aside. When 'tis cast off,<br/> Discarded there it lies, a senseless thing,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/> Mere food for others. Such its lineage.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span><br/> A babbling fantasy, a murderer:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/> Such is its name. No essence here is seen.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Thus should a brother, with an eager will.<br/> Regard this mass. Mindful and self-possessed<br/> By day, yea, day and night, let him cast off<br/> All fetters, make a refuge of himself,<br/> And act as if his head were all ablaze,<span class="f3"><sup>16</sup></span> Aspiring for the state that changeth not.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span></p>
