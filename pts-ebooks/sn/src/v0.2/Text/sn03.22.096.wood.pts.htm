    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, is there any body<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any feeling<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any perception<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any activities<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any consciousness<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, brother, there is no material form<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no feeling<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no perception<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are no activities<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no consciousness<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One took up||<br/> a little pellet of cow dung in his hand,<br/> and said to that brother:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even the getting of a selfhood<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> so small as this, brother,<br/> is not permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">If the getting of a selfhood<br/> so small as this, brother,<br/> were permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it would stand fast,<br/> then the living of the holy life<br/> for the best destruction of suffering<br/> would not be set forth.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch, brother,<br/> as there is no getting of a selfhood<br/> even so small as this,<br/> permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it would stand fast,<br/> therefore the living of the holy life<br/> for the best destruction of suffering<br/> is set forth.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Formerly, brother, I was a ruler,<br/> a noble crowned,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> and (as such) I had eighty thousand townships,<br/> chief of which <span class="f2 g"><b>[123]</b></span> was the royal town, Kusāvatī.</p>

    <p class="f4">When I was such, brother,<br/> I had eighty thousand palaces,<br/> chief of which was the Palace of Righteousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I had eighty thousand halls,<br/> chief of which was the Great Assembly Hall.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I had eighty thousand couches of solid ivory,<br/> of solid wood,<br/> of solid gold<br/> of solid silver,<br/> furnished with woollen draperies,<br/> with white draperies,<br/> with flower-worked coverlets<br/> and spread with choicest skins of antelopes,<br/> with canopies above<br/> and scarlet cushions at each end.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when I was such, brethren,<br/> I had four and eighty thousand elephants<br/> with trappings of gold<br/> and gilded harness,<br/> covered, with nets of gold thread,<br/> chief of which was the royal elephant called Sabbath.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand steeds,<br/> with trappings of gold<br/> and gilded banners,<br/> covered with nets of gold thread,<br/> chief of which was the royal steed Thundercloud.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand chariots,<br/> with trappings of gold<br/> and gilded banners,<br/> covered with nets of gold thread,<br/> chief which was the royal chariot The Conqueror.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand jewels,<br/> chief of which was the Gem.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand women,<br/> chief of whom was Queen of Good Fortune.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand vassals,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> chief of whom was the Crown Prince.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand cows,<br/> with tethers of fine jute<br/> and silver milk-pails.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And I had four and eighty myriads of garments<br/> woven of finest flax,<br/> of finest silk,<br/> of finest wool,<br/> of finest cotton.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[124]</b></span> And I had four and eighty myriad vessels,<br/> in which both morning and evening<br/> rice food was served.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of those four and eighty thousand towns, brother,<br/> this town Kusāvatī<br/> was my royal residence in those days.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand palaces, brother,<br/> the Palace of Righteousness<br/> was where I dwelt in those days.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand halls,<br/> the Great Hall of Assembly<br/> was where I dwelt in those days.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand couches,<br/> the couch of solid ivory,<br/> of solid wood,<br/> of solid gold<br/> or of solid silver<br/> was the one which I enjoyed.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of the four and eighty thousand elephants,<br/> the royal elephant called Sabbath<br/> was the one I mounted in those days.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand steeds,<br/> my royal steed called Thundercloud<br/> was the one I mounted in those days.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand chariots,<br/> the chariot Conqueror<br/> was the one I mounted in those days.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand women,<br/> Khattiyāni<br/> or Velamikā<br/> was the one who waited on me in those days.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of those four and eighty myriads of garments,<br/> one suit there was I donned in those days,<br/> made of finest flax,<br/> of finest silk,<br/> of finest wool,<br/> or of finest cotton.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of those four and eighty myriad vessels<br/> there was one from which I ate<br/> a measure of choicest rice<br/> and drank broth for seasoning thereto.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus all those things of the world,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> brother,<br/> are past and gone<br/> and perished utterly.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus impermanent, brother,<br/> are things of the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus mutable, brother, are they.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus doomed to perish, brother,<br/> are they;<br/> insomuch that there is enough<br/> for disgust at all things of the world,<br/> enough to be averse from them,<br/> enough to be freed from them."</p>
