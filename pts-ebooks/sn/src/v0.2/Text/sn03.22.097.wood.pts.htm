    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, is there any body<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any feeling<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any perception<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any activities<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any consciousness<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, brother, there is no material form<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no feeling<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no perception<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are no activities<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no consciousness<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One took up a pinch of dust on the tip of his nail and said to that brother:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even thus much material form, brother,<br/> is not permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">If even thus much material form, brother,<br/> were permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it would stand fast,<br/> then the living of the holy life<br/> for the utter destruction of suffering<br/> would not be set forth.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as even thus much material form, brother,<br/> is not permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it would stand fast,<br/> therefore the living of the holy life<br/> for the utter destruction of suffering<br/> is set forth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">If even thus much feeling, brother,<br/> were permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it would stand fast,<br/> then the living of the holy life<br/> for the utter destruction of suffering<br/> would not be set forth.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">If even thus much perception, brother,<br/> were permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it would stand fast,<br/> then the living of the holy life<br/> for the utter destruction of suffering<br/> would not be set forth.|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">If even thus much of the activities, brother,<br/> were permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it would stand fast,<br/> then the living of the holy life<br/> for the utter destruction of suffering<br/> would not be set forth.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as even thus much of the activities, brother,<br/> is not permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it would stand fast,<br/> therefore the living of the holy life<br/> for the utter destruction of suffering<br/> is set forth.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">If even thus much consciousness, brother,<br/> were permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it would stand fast,<br/> then the living of the holy life<br/> for the utter destruction of suffering<br/> would not be set forth.|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Now as to this, what think you, brother?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>
