    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, is there any body<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any feeling<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any perception<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any activities<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any consciousness<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, brother, there is no material form<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no feeling<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no perception<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are no activities<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no consciousness<br/> that is permanent,<br/> stable,<br/> by nature lasting,<br/> unchanging,<br/> like unto the eternal,<br/> so that thus it will stand fast."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Suddhikaṅ</i> or <i>Samuddakaṅ</i>. The name of a section at <i>S.</i> i, 165, so called after a fastidious brahmin, <i>Suddhiko.</i> But the subject of purity is not referred to here, and it is not clear why such a title is assigned. There is some confusion in the text between <i>suddhikaṅ</i> and <i>suddkakaṅ.</i> So at Bk. viii. <i>infra</i> we should read the former.</p>
