    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Incalculable,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> brethren, is the beginning<br/> of this round of rebirth.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">No beginning is made known<br/> of beings<br/> wrapped in ignorance,<br/> fettered by craving,<br/> who run on,<br/> who fare on the round of rebirth.</p>

    <p class="f4">There comes a time, brethren,<br/> when the mighty ocean dries up,<br/> is utterly drained,<br/> comes no more to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">But of beings hindered by ignorance,<br/> fettered by craving,<br/> who run on,<br/> who fare on the round of rebirth,<br/> I declare no end-making.</p>

    <p class="f4">There comes a time, brethren,<br/> when Sineru,<br/> monarch of mountains,<br/> is consumed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is destroyed,<br/> comes no more to be.</p>

    <p class="f4">But of beings hindered by ignorance,<br/> fettered by craving,<br/> who run for ever the round of rebirth,<br/> I declare no end-making.</p>

    <p class="f4">There comes a time, brethren,<br/> when the mighty earth is consumed,<br/> is destroyed,<br/> comes no more to be.</p>
