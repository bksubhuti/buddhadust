    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"By knowing, brethren, by seeing<br/> is, I declare,<br/> the destruction of the <i>āsavas,</i><br/> not by not knowing,<br/> by not seeing.</p>

    <p class="f4">And by knowing what, brethren,<br/> by seeing what,<br/> is there destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>?</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Such is body,<br/> such is the arising of body,<br/> such is the ceasing of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">By thus knowing, brethren,<br/> by thus seeing<br/> is there destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Such is feeling,<br/> such is the arising of feeling,<br/> such is the ceasing of feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">By thus knowing, brethren,<br/> by thus seeing<br/> is there destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Such is perception,<br/> such is the arising of perception,<br/> such is the ceasing of perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">By thus knowing, brethren,<br/> by thus seeing<br/> is there destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Such are the activities,<br/> such is the arising of the activities,<br/> such is the ceasing of the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">By thus knowing, brethren,<br/> by thus seeing<br/> is there destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">such is consciousness,<br/> such is the arising of consciousness,<br/> such is the ceasing of consciousness."</p>

    <p class="f4">By thus knowing, brethren,<br/> by thus seeing<br/> is there destruction of the Ãsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, brethren,<br/> in a brother who lives neglectful of self-training<br/> there should arise this wish:</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet for all that<br/> his heart is not freed from the <i>āsavas</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>
