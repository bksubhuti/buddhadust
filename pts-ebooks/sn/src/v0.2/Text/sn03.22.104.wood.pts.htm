    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, I will teach you suffering,<br/> the arising of suffering,<br/> the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the way leading to the ceasing of suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is suffering?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is to be called the five grasping groups.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The body grasping group,<br/> the feeling grasping group,<br/> the perception grasping group,<br/> the the activities grasping group,<br/> the consciousness grasping group.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called suffering.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is the arising of suffering?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is that craving which,<br/> accompanied by lure and lust,<br/> leads downward to rebirth,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">the craving for feeling,<br/> the craving for rebirth,<br/> the craving for no rebirth.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called the arising of suffering.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is the ceasing of suffering?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the utter passionless ceasing,<br/> the giving up,<br/> the abandonment of,<br/> the release from,<br/> the freedom from<br/> attachment to,<br/> that craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called the ceasing of suffering.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren,<br/> is the way going to<br/> the ceasing of suffering?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span> Right view,<br/> right aims,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called the way going to the ceasing of suffering.</p>
