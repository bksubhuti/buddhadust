    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, brethren,<br/> the person-pack,<br/> the arising of the person-pack,<br/> the ceasing of the person-pack,<br/> the way to the ceasing of the person-pack.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is the person-pack?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the five groups based on grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The group based on body-grasping,<br/> that based on feeling-grasping,<br/> on perception-grasping,<br/> on the activities-grasping,<br/> on consciousness-grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called the person-pack.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is the arising of the person-pack?</p>

    <p class="f4">Just that craving which,<br/> accompanied by lure and lust,<br/> leads down to rebirth,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">the craving for feeling,<br/> the craving for rebirth,<br/> the craving for no rebirth.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called<br/> the arising of the person-pack.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is the ceasing<br/> of the person-pack?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the utter passionless ceasing,<br/> the giving up,<br/> the abandonment of,<br/> the release from,<br/> the freedom from<br/> attachment to,<br/> that craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called<br/> the ceasing of the person-pack.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren,<br/> is the way going to<br/> the ceasing of the person-pack?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view,<br/> right aims,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is called<br/> the way going to the ceasing of the person-pack.</p>
