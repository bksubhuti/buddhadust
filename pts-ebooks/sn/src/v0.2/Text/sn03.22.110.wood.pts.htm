    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, there are these five grasping-groups.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The body-grasping group,<br/> the feeling-grasping-group,<br/> the perception-grasping-group,<br/> the activities-grasping-group,<br/> the consciousness-grasping-group.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when, brethren, a brother,<br/> having seen as they really are<br/> both the arising and the ending of,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> and the escape from<br/> the five grasping-groups,<br/> is released without grasping, -<br/> this one, brethren, is called || ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'A brother who is an arahant,<br/> in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br/> who has lived the life,<br/> done the task,<br/> lifted the burden,<br/> won his own welfare,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> worn out the fetters of rebirth,<br/> and is released by perfect insight.'"</p>
