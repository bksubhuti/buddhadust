    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever desire, brethren,<br/> whatsoever lust,<br/> whatsoever lure,<br/> whatsoever craving,<br/> whatsoever grasping after systems,<br/> addiction to dogma<br/> and mental bias there be<br/> concerning body, do ye abandon them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus will that body be abandoned,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever desire, brethren,<br/> whatsoever lust,<br/> whatsoever lure,<br/> whatsoever craving,<br/> whatsoever grasping after systems,<br/> addiction to dogma<br/> and mental bias there be<br/> concerning feeling, do ye abandon that.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus will that feeling be abandoned,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever desire, brethren,<br/> whatsoever lust,<br/> whatsoever lure,<br/> whatsoever craving,<br/> whatsoever grasping after systems,<br/> addiction to dogma<br/> and mental bias there be<br/> concerning perception, do ye abandon that.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus will that perception be abandoned,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever desire, brethren,<br/> whatsoever lust,<br/> whatsoever lure,<br/> whatsoever craving,<br/> whatsoever grasping after systems,<br/> addiction to dogma<br/> and mental bias there be<br/> concerning the activities, do ye abandon that.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus will activities be abandoned,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever desire, brethren,<br/> whatsoever lust,<br/> whatsoever lure,<br/> whatsoever craving,<br/> whatsoever grasping after systems,<br/> addiction to dogma<br/> and mental bias there be<br/> concerning consciousness, do ye abandon that.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus will that consciousness be abandoned,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>
