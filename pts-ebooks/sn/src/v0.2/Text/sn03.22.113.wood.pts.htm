    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Ignorance, ignorance,' tis said, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, what is ignorance,<br/> and how far is one ignorant?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, brother, the untaught many-folk know not body,<br/> know not the arising of body,<br/> know not the ceasing of body,<br/> know not the way going to the ceasing of body.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They know not feeling,<br/> know not the arising of feeling,<br/> know not the ceasing of feeling,<br/> know not the way going to the ceasing of feeling.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They know not perception,<br/> know not the arising of perception,<br/> know not the ceasing of perception,<br/> know not the way going to the ceasing of perception.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They know not the activities,<br/> know not the arising of the activities,<br/> know not the ceasing of the activities,<br/> know not the way going to the ceasing of the activities.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They know not consciousness,<br/> know not the arising of consciousness,<br/> know not the ceasing of consciousness,<br/> know not the way going to the ceasing of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brother, is called ignorance,<br/> and thus far is one ignorant."</p>
