    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Wisdom, wisdom,' 'tis said, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, what is wisdom,<br/> and how far has one wisdom?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, brother, the well-taught Ariyan disciple understands body,<br/> understands the arising of body,<br/> understands the ceasing of body,<br/> understands the way going to the ceasing of body.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands feeling,<br/> understands the arising of feeling,<br/> understands the ceasing of feeling,<br/> understands the way going to the ceasing of feeling.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands perception,<br/> understands the arising of perception,<br/> understands the ceasing of perception,<br/> understands the way going to the ceasing of perception.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands the activities,<br/> understands the arising of the activities,<br/> understands the ceasing of the activities,<br/> understands the way going to the ceasing of the activities.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands consciousness,<br/> understands the arising of consciousness,<br/> understands the ceasing of consciousness,<br/> understands the way going to the ceasing of consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brother, is called wisdom,<br/> and thus far has one wisdom."</p>
