    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Norm-teacher, Norm-teacher,' is the saying, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">How far, lord, is one a Norm-teacher?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"If a brother teaches a doctrine<br/> of revulsion from body,<br/> of its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'Norm-teacher,' brother.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother be apt<br/> for revulsion from body,<br/> for its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'one apt in teaching<br/> what conforms with the Norm.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother,<br/> by revulsion from body<br/> be released from grasping<br/> by making it to fade away,<br/> by making it to cease,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'a brother who in this very life hath won Nibbāna.'</p>
