    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Norm-teacher, Norm-teacher,' is the saying, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">How far, lord, is one a Norm-teacher?</p>

    <p class="f4">How far is one a teacher of what conforms with the Norm?</p>

    <p class="f4">How far has a brother won Nibbāna?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"If a brother teaches a doctrine<br/> of revulsion from body,<br/> of its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'Norm-teacher,' brother.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother be apt<br/> for revulsion from body,<br/> for its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'one apt in teaching<br/> what conforms with the Norm.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother,<br/> by revulsion from body<br/> be released from grasping<br/> by making it to fade away,<br/> by making it to cease,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'a brother who in this very life hath won Nibbāna.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"If a brother teaches a doctrine<br/> of revulsion from feeling,<br/> of its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'Norm-teacher,' brother.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother be apt<br/> for revulsion from feeling,<br/> for its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'one apt in teaching<br/> what conforms with the Norm.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother,<br/> by revulsion from feeling<br/> be released from grasping<br/> by making it to fade away,<br/> by making it to cease,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'a brother who in this very life hath won Nibbāna.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"If a brother teaches a doctrine<br/> of revulsion from perception,<br/> of its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'Norm-teacher,' brother.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother be apt<br/> for revulsion from perception,<br/> for its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'one apt in teaching<br/> what conforms with the Norm.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"If a brother teaches a doctrine<br/> of revulsion from the activities,<br/> of its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'Norm-teacher,' brother.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother be apt<br/> for revulsion from the activities,<br/> for its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'one apt in teaching<br/> what conforms with the Norm.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother,<br/> by revulsion from the activities<br/> be released from grasping<br/> by making it to fade away,<br/> by making it to cease,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'a brother who in this very life hath won Nibbāna.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"If a brother teaches a doctrine<br/> of revulsion from consciousness,<br/> of its fading away,<br/> its ceasing,<br/> well may he be called<br/> 'Norm-teacher,' brother.</p>
