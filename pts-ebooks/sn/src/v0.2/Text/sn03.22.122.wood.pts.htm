    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta<br/> and the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> were staying at Benares,<br/> in Isipatana,<br/> in the Deer-Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita,<br/> rising at eventide from his solitude,<br/> came to the venerable Sāriputta<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> he thus addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta,<br/> what are the conditions<br/> that should be pondered with method<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> by a virtuous brother?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"The five grasping-groups, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/> are the conditions<br/> which should be pondered with method<br/> by a virtuous brother,<br/> as being impermanent,<br/> suffering,<br/> sick,<br/> as an imposthume,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> as a dart,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> as pain,<br/> as ill-health,<br/> as alien,<br/> as transitory,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> empty<br/> and soulless.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">What five groups?</p>

    <p class="f4">The group of body-grasping,<br/> the group of feeling-grasping,<br/> the group of perception-grasping,<br/> the group of activities-grasping,<br/> the group of consciousness-grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">By a virtuous brother, friend Koṭṭhita, these five groups of grasping should be pondered with method,<br/> as being impermanent,<br/> suffering,<br/> sick,<br/> as an imposthume,<br/> as a dart,<br/> as pain,<br/> as ill-health,<br/> as alien,<br/> as transitory,<br/> empty<br/> and soulless.</p>
