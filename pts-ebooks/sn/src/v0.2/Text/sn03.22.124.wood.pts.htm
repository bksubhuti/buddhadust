    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Kappa,<br/> came to the Exalted One<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Kappa thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, how should one know,<br/> how should one see,<br/> so that in this body,<br/> with its consciousness<br/> as well as  all external objects,<br/> he has no more thought of<br/> 'I' and 'mine,'<br/> no leanings to conceit?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever bodily form, Kappa,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> whatsoever bodily form<br/> you see as it really is<br/> by perfect insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the self of me,'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever feeling, Kappa,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> whatsoever bodily form<br/> you see as it really is<br/> by perfect insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the self of me,'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever perception, Kappa,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> whatsoever bodily form<br/> you see as it really is<br/> by perfect insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the self of me,'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever activities, Kappa,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> whatsoever bodily form<br/> you see as it really is<br/> by perfect insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the self of me,'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever consciousness, Kappa,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> whatsoever bodily form<br/> you see as it really is<br/> by perfect insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the self of me,</p>

    <p class="f4">-to you so knowing,<br/> so seeing, Kappa,<br/> in this body<br/> <br/> with its consciousness<br/> as well as all external objects,<br/> there is no thought of 'I' and 'mine,'<br/> no leaning to conceit."</p>
