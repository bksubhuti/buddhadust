    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Kappa,<br/> came to the Exalted One<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Kappa thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, how should one know,<br/> how should one see,<br/> so that in this body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> together with its consciousness<br/> and in all external objects,<br/> the mind has gone away from all thought of<br/> 'I' and 'mine,'<br/> gone from conceit,<br/> has passed beyond the ways of conceit,<br/> is calmed,<br/> and utterly released?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever bodily form, Kappa,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> whatsoever bodily form<br/> you see as it really is<br/> by perfect insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the self of me,'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever feeling, Kappa,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> whatsoever bodily form<br/> you see as it really is<br/> by perfect insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the self of me,'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever perception, Kappa,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> whatsoever bodily form<br/> you see as it really is<br/> by perfect insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the self of me,'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever activities, Kappa,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> whatsoever bodily form<br/> you see as it really is<br/> by perfect insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the self of me,'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever consciousness, Kappa,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> gross or subtle,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near,<br/> whatsoever bodily form<br/> you see as it really is<br/> by perfect insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/> this am not I;<br/> this is not the self of me,</p>

    <p class="f4">-to you so knowing,<br/> so seeing, Kappa,<br/> as to this body,<br/> together with its consciousness<br/> and in all external objects,<br/> the mind has gone away from all thought of<br/> 'I' and 'mine,'<br/> gone from conceit,<br/> has passed beyond the ways of conceit,<br/> is calmed,<br/> and utterly released."</p>
