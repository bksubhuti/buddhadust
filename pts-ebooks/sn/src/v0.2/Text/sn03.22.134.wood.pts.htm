    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta<br/> and the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita<br/> were staying at Benares,<br/> in Isipatana,<br/> in the Deer-Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita,<br/> rising at eventide from his solitude,<br/> came to the venerable Sāriputta<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> he thus addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Ignorance! Ignorance!' is the saying, friend Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, friend Sāriputta what is ignorance,<br/> and to what extent is one ignorant?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, friend, the untaught many-folk know not<br/> as it really is<br/> the coming-to-pass,<br/> the passing-away,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> the escape from body.</p>

    <p class="f4">They know not<br/> as it really is<br/> the coming-to-pass,<br/> the passing-away,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> the escape from feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">They know not<br/> as it really is<br/> the coming-to-pass,<br/> the passing-away,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> the escape from perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">They know not<br/> as it really is<br/> the coming-to-pass,<br/> the passing-away,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> the escape from the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">They know not<br/> as it really is<br/> the coming-to-pass,<br/> the passing-away,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> the escape from consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, friend, is ignorance,<br/> and thus far is one ignorant."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Wisdom! Wisdom!' is the saying, friend Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, friend Sāriputta what is wisdom,<br/> and to what extent has one wisdom?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, friend, the well-taught Ariyan disciple knows<br/> as it really is<br/> the coming-to-pass,<br/> the passing-away,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> the escape from body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Knows<br/> as it really is<br/> the coming-to-pass,<br/> the passing-away,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> the escape from feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Knows<br/> as it really is<br/> the coming-to-pass,<br/> the passing-away,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> the escape from perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">Knows<br/> as it really is<br/> the coming-to-pass,<br/> the passing-away,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> the escape from the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, friend, is wisdom,<br/> and thus far has one wisdom."</p>
