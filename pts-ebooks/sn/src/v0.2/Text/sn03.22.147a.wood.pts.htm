    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"For a clansman, brethren,<br/> who has gone forth in faith<br/> this is the proper way:</p>

    <p class="f4">Let him live seeing suffering in body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let him live seeing suffering in feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let him live seeing suffering in perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let him live seeing suffering in the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let him live seeing suffering in consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">So living seeing suffering in body,<br/> so living seeing suffering in feeling,||<br/> so living seeing suffering in perception,||<br/> so living seeing suffering in the activities,||<br/> so living seeing suffering in consciousness||<br/> he fully understands body,||<br/> he fully understands feeling,||<br/> he fully understands perception,||<br/> he fully understands the activities,||<br/> he fully understands consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Fully understanding body,||<br/> fully understanding feeling,||<br/> fully understanding perception,||<br/> fully understanding the activities,||<br/> fully understanding consciousness<br/> he is fully released from body,<br/> he is fully released from feeling,<br/> he is fully released from perception,<br/> he is fully released from the activities,<br/> he is fully released from consciousness;<br/> he is fully released from birth,<br/> from old age and death,<br/> grief,<br/> lamentation,<br/> suffering,<br/> woe<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is fully released, I declare,<br/> from suffering.'</p>
