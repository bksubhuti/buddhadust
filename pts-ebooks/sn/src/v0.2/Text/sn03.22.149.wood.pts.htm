    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being what, brethren,<br/> clinging to what,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> does one's own weal-and-woe arise?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed if the meaning of these words<br/> should show itself in the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being a body, brethren,<br/> by clinging to body,<br/> one's <span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span> own weal-and-woe arise.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being feeling, brethren,<br/> by clinging to feeling,<br/> one's own weal-and-woe arise.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being perception, brethren,<br/> by clinging to perception,<br/> one's own weal-and-woe arise.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being the activities, brethren,<br/> by clinging to the activities,<br/> one's own weal-and-woe arise.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being consciousness, brethren,<br/> by clinging to consciousness,<br/> one's own weal-and-woe arise.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that, what think ye, brethren?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable —<br/> could one's own weal-and-woe arise<br/> without a clinging to that?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is feeling permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable —<br/> could one's own weal-and-woe arise<br/> without a clinging to that?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is perception permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable —<br/> could one's own weal-and-woe arise<br/> without a clinging to that?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Are the activities permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable —<br/> could one's own weal-and-woe arise<br/> without a clinging to that?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable —<br/> could one's own weal-and-woe arise<br/> without a clinging to that?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wherefore, brethren, he who thus sees<br/> conceives disgust at body,<br/> at feeling,<br/> at perception,<br/> at the activities,<br/> at consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being disgusted<br/> he is repelled by them;<br/> by that repulsion he is released;<br/> by that release he is set free;<br/> knowledge arises:<br/> in the freed man is the freed thing,<br/> and he knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth;<br/> lived is the righteous life;<br/> done is the task;<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter."</p>
