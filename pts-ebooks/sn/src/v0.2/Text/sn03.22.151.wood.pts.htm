    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being what, brethren,<br/> by clinging to what,<br/> depending upon what,<br/> does this view arise:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is the self,<br/> that is the world,<br/> that hereafter<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> shall I become,<br/> permanent,<br/> lasting,<br/> eternal,<br/> by nature unchangeable?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed if the meaning of these words<br/> should show itself in the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being a body, brethren,<br/> by clinging to body,<br/> depending on body,<br/> one holds the view:<br/> 'That is the self,<br/> that is the world,<br/> that hereafter shall I become,<br/> permanent,<br/> lasting,<br/> eternal,<br/> by nature unchangeable'.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being feeling, brethren,<br/> by clinging to feeling,<br/> depending on feeling,<br/> one holds the view:<br/> 'This is mine;<br/> this am I;<br/> this is the self of me'.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being perception, brethren,<br/> by clinging to perception,<br/> depending on perception,<br/> one holds the view:<br/> 'That is the self,<br/> that is the world,<br/> that hereafter shall I become,<br/> permanent,<br/> lasting,<br/> eternal,<br/> by nature unchangeable'.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being the activities, brethren,<br/> by clinging to the activities,<br/> depending on the activities,<br/> one holds the view:<br/> 'That is the self,<br/> that is the world,<br/> that hereafter shall I become,<br/> permanent,<br/> lasting,<br/> eternal,<br/> by nature unchangeable'.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being consciousness, brethren,<br/> by clinging to consciousness,<br/> depending on consciousness,<br/> one holds the view:<br/> 'That is the self,<br/> that is the world,<br/> that hereafter shall I become,<br/> permanent,<br/> lasting,<br/> eternal,<br/> by nature unchangeable'.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that, what think ye, brethren?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then what is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> unstable in nature,<br/> can such a view as:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is the self,<br/> that is the world,<br/> that hereafter shall I become,<br/> permanent,<br/> lasting,<br/> eternal,<br/> by nature unchangeable'</p>

    <p class="f4">arise without a clinging to that?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wherefore, brethren, he who thus sees<br/> conceives disgust at body,<br/> at feeling,<br/> at perception,<br/> at the activities,<br/> at consciousness.</p>
