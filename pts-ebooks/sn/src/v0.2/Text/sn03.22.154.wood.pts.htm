    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being what, brethren,<br/> by clinging to what,<br/> depending upon what,<br/> does the person-pack view arise?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed if the meaning of these words<br/> should show itself in the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being a body, brethren,<br/> by clinging to body,<br/> depending on body,<br/> the person-pack view arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being feeling, brethren,<br/> by clinging to feeling,<br/> depending on feeling,<br/> the person-pack view arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being perception, brethren,<br/> by clinging to perception,<br/> depending on perception,<br/> the person-pack view arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being the activities, brethren,<br/> by clinging to the activities,<br/> depending on the activities,<br/> the person-pack view arises.</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being consciousness, brethren,<br/> by clinging to consciousness,<br/> depending on consciousness,<br/> the person-pack view arises.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that, what think ye, brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then without a clinging<br/> to what is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable,<br/> could the person-pack view arise?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is feeling permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then without a clinging<br/> to what is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable,<br/> could the person-pack view arise?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is perception permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then without a clinging<br/> to what is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable,<br/> could the person-pack view arise?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Are the activities permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then without a clinging<br/> to what is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable,<br/> could the person-pack view arise?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then without a clinging<br/> to what is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable,<br/> could the person-pack view arise?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wherefore, brethren, he who thus sees<br/> conceives disgust at body,<br/> at feeling,<br/> at perception,<br/> at the activities,<br/> at consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being disgusted<br/> he is repelled by them;<br/> by that repulsion he is released;<br/> by that release he is set free;<br/> knowledge arises:<br/> in the freed man is the freed thing,<br/> and he knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth;<br/> lived is the righteous life;<br/> done is the task;<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter."</p>
