    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Approaching the Exalted One he said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One were to teach me a doctrine, hearing which from the Exalted One, I might dwell remote, strenuous, ardent and intent.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to this, what think you, Ānanda?</p>

    <p class="f4">Now as to this, what think you, Ānanda?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> unstable in nature,<br/> is it right to regard it thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is mine,<br/> this am I<br/> this is the Self of me?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is feeling permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is perception permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Are the activities permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wherefore, Ānanda, he who thus sees<br/> conceives disgust at body,<br/> at feeling,<br/> at perception,<br/> at the activities,<br/> at consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being disgusted<br/> he is repelled by them;<br/> by that repulsion he is released;<br/> by that release he is set free;<br/> knowledge arises:<br/> in the freed man is the freed thing,<br/> and he knows:</p>
