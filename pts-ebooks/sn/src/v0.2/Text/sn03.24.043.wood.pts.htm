    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being what, brethren,<br/> by clinging to what,<br/> by depending upon what<br/> does such a view as this arise:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The self is both bliss and suffering,<br/> is without sickness,<br/> after death'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed if the meaning of these words<br/> should show itself in the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being a body, brethren,<br/> by clinging to body,<br/> depending on body,<br/> arises such a view as this:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'The self is both bliss and suffering,<br/> is without sickness,<br/> after death.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being feeling, brethren,<br/> by clinging to feeling,<br/> depending on feeling,<br/> arises such a view as this:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'The self is both bliss and suffering,<br/> is without sickness,<br/> after death.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being perception, brethren,<br/> by clinging to perception,<br/> depending on perception,<br/> arises such a view as this:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'The self is both bliss and suffering,<br/> is without sickness,<br/> after death.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being the activities, brethren,<br/> by clinging to the activities,<br/> depending on the activities,<br/> arises such a view as this:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'The self is both bliss and suffering,<br/> is without sickness,<br/> after death.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"There being consciousness, brethren,<br/> by clinging to consciousness,<br/> depending on consciousness,<br/> arises such a view as this:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'The self is both bliss and suffering,<br/> is without sickness,<br/> after death.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that, what think ye, brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/> is it weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> by nature changeable, -<br/> without clinging to that<br/> can such a view as this arise:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'The self is both bliss and suffering,<br/> is without sickness,<br/> after death'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is feeling permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now what is seen,<br/> heard,<br/> sensed,<br/> known,<br/> attained,<br/> sought after,<br/> thought out by mind, -<br/> is that permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But when in an Ariyan disciple<br/> doubt as to these six points<br/> when for him doubt as to suffering is put away,<br/> doubt as to the arising of suffering,<br/> as to the ceasing of suffering,<br/> as to the way going to the ceasing of suffering is put away, -<br/> then this Ariyan disciple is called</p>
