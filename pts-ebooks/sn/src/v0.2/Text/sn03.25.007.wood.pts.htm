    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Volitional acts occasioned by body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> brethren, are impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Volitional acts occasioned by sound, brethren, are impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Volitional acts occasioned by scent, brethren, are impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Volitional acts occasioned by savour, brethren, are impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Volitional acts occasioned by tangibles, brethren, are impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Volitional acts occasioned by ideas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn2" href="#edn2">ed2</a></sup></span> brethren, are impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">He who has faith and confidence, brethren,<br/> in these doctrines,<br/> such an one is called</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walker in faith,<br/> one who enters on assurance of perfection,<br/> one who enters on the state of the worthy,<br/> one who has escaped the state of the many-folk;<br/> one incapable of doing a deed<br/> by which he would be reborn in purgatory<br/> or in the womb of an animal,<br/> or in the realm of Petas;<br/> one incapable of dying without realizing<br/> the fruits of stream-winning.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He, brethren, by whom these doctrines<br/> by his insight<br/> are moderately approved,<br/> is called</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walker in Dhamma,<br/> one who enters on assurance of perfection,<br/> one who enters on the state of the worthy,<br/> one who has escaped the state of the many-folk;<br/> one incapable of doing a deed<br/> by which he would be reborn in purgatory<br/> or in the womb of an animal,<br/> or in the realm of Petas;<br/> one incapable of dying without realizing<br/> the fruits of stream-winning.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He, brethren, who thus knows,<br/> thus sees<br/> these doctrines,<br/> is called</p>

    <p class="f4">'Stream-winner,<br/> saved from destruction,<br/> assured,<br/> bound for enlightenment.'"</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> As with §2, Woodward translates <i>'rūpa'</i> as body, but what is being spoken of here are the objects of the senses and that would be 'visible objects' or 'sights' not just the body.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a></sup> <i>'Dhammā'</i>. Here Woodward changes his translation from 'state of mind' which he used in §2. and again from 'phenomenon' which he used in §6.</p>
