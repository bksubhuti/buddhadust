    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Craving for body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Craving for sounds, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Craving for scents, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Craving for savours, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Craving for tangibles, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Craving for ideas, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walker in faith,<br/> one who enters on assurance of perfection,<br/> one who enters on the state of the worthy,<br/> one who has escaped the state of the many-folk;<br/> one incapable of doing a deed<br/> by which he would be reborn in purgatory<br/> or in the womb of an animal,<br/> or in the realm of Petas;<br/> one incapable of dying without realizing<br/> the fruits of stream-winning.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> As with §2, Woodward translates <i>'rūpa'</i> as body, but what is being spoken of here are the objects of the senses and that would be 'visible objects' or 'sights' not just the body.</p>
