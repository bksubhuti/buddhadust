    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The element of earth, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">The element of water, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">The element of heat, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">The element of air, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">The element of space, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">The element of consciousness, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> changeable,<br/> becoming otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who has faith and confidence, brethren,<br/> in these doctrines,<br/> such an one is called</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walker in faith,<br/> one who enters on assurance of perfection,<br/> one who enters on the state of the worthy,<br/> one who has escaped the state of the many-folk;<br/> one incapable of doing a deed<br/> by which he would be reborn in purgatory<br/> or in the womb of an animal,<br/> or in the realm of Petas;<br/> one incapable of dying without realizing<br/> the fruits of stream-winning.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He, brethren, by whom these doctrines<br/> by his insight<br/> are moderately approved,<br/> is called</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walker in Dhamma,<br/> one who enters on assurance of perfection,<br/> one who enters on the state of the worthy,<br/> one who has escaped the state of the many-folk;<br/> one incapable of doing a deed<br/> by which he would be reborn in purgatory<br/> or in the womb of an animal,<br/> or in the realm of Petas;<br/> one incapable of dying without realizing<br/> the fruits of stream-winning.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Stream-winner,<br/> saved from destruction,<br/> assured,<br/> bound for enlightenment.'"</p>
