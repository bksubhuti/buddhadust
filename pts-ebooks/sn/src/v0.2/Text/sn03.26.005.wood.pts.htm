    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, the arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of feeling born of contact by the eye, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of feeling born of contact by the ear, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of feeling born of contact by the nose, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of feeling born of contact by the tongue, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of feeling born of contact by the body, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of feeling born of contact by the mind, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, brethren, the ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of feeling born of contact by the eye, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of feeling born of contact by the ear, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of feeling born of contact by the nose, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of feeling born of contact by the tongue, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of feeling born of contact by the body, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of feeling born of contact by the mind, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death."</p>
