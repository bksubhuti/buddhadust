    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, the arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of perception<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> of body, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of perception of sounds, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of perception of scents, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of perception of savours, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of perception of tangibles, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising,<br/> the establishing,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the appearing of perception of phenomena, -<br/> this is the arising of suffering,<br/> the establishing of diseases,<br/> the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, brethren, the ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of perception of body, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of perception of sounds,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of perception of scents, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of perception of savours, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of perception of tangibles, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing,<br/> the calming,<br/> the coming to an end of perception of phenomena, -<br/> that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/> the calming of disease,<br/> the coming to an end of decay-and-death."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Here Woodward has apparently mistakenly used 'consciousness' for 'perception.' This must be just a careless oversight as he uses 'perception' for the title, 'consciousness' for §3 here and 'perception' for §6 in the previous set. Doubt remains however because he has again repeated this translation in SN 3.27.6 and there has changed his translation of <i>'rūpa'</i> to 'visible shape' which means he must have at least looked at his translation. I have changed the translation or corrected the mistake because it is pretty much a consensus opinion that the translation is 'perception.' See Glossology: <i>Saññā</i></p>
