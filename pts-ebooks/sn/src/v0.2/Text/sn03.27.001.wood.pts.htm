    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, the desire-and-lust that is in the eye<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in the ear<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in the nose<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in the tongue<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in the body<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in the mind<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, brethren, when in a brother<br/> the heart's corruption<br/> in these six points<br/> is put away,<br/> and his heart is bent on renunciation,<br/> then, compassed about<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> with renunciation,<br/> his heart is seen to be pliable<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> for penetrating those things<br/> that are to be realized.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Ten <i>kilesa's</i> are given in Abhidhamma (<i>Bud. Psy. Eth.,</i> § 1229 <i>f.</i>); greed, hate, dullness, conceit, speculative opinion, perplexity, stolidity, distraction, unconscientiousness, indiscretion.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Paribhāvitaṅ.</i> <i>Cf. supra,</i> xxii, § 101.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> At S. v, 92-3 the corruptions or flaws of the different metals are enumerated, which make them incapable of perfect workmanship. Then the five corruptions or faults of the heart are given: failure to be soft, pliable, shining, delicate and capable of perfect moulding. So we read in cases where the Master is turning an enquirer to salvation, he questions, exhorts, chides, calms, fires and arouses him. Then, seeing that his heart is pliable, he opens up the deeper matters of the Norm.</p>
