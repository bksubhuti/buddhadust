    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, the desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of eye-contact<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of ear-contact<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of nose-contact<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of tongue-contact<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of body-contact<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of mind-contact<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, brethren, when in a brother<br/> the heart's corruption<br/> in these six points<br/> is put away,<br/> and his heart is bent on renunciation,<br/> then, compassed about with renunciation,<br/> his heart is seen to be pliable<br/> for penetrating those things<br/> that are to be realized.'</p>
