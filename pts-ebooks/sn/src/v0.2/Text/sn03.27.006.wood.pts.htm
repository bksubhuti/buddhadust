    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, the desire-and-lust that is in perception<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> of visible shape<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in perception of sound<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in perception of scent<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in perception of savour<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in perception of tangibles<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in perception of things<br/> is a corruption of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, brethren, when in a brother<br/> the heart's corruption<br/> in these six points<br/> is put away,<br/> and his heart is bent on renunciation,<br/> then, compassed about with renunciation,<br/> his heart is seen to be pliable<br/> for penetrating those things<br/> that are to be realized.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> As in SN 3.26.6, here Woodward has apparently mistakenly used 'consciousness' for 'perception.' This must be just a careless oversight as he uses 'perception' for the title, 'consciousness' for §3 here and 'perception' for §6 in the previous set. Doubt remains however because of the use here where he has changed his translation of <i>'rūpa'</i> to 'visible shape' which means he must have at least looked at this translation. I have changed the translation or corrected the mistake because it is pretty much a consensus opinion that the translation is 'perception.' See Glossology: <i>Saññā</i></p>
