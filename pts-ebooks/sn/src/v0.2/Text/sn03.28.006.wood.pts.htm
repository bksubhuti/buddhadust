    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> rising at early dawn,<br/> robed himself,<br/> took bowl and robe<br/> and entered Sāvatthī to beg for alms.</p>

    <p class="f4">After going his begging-rounds in Sāvatthī<br/> and returning from begging<br/> he ate his meal<br/> and drew near Dark Grove<br/> for noonday rest.</p>

    <p class="f4">Plunging into Dark Grove,<br/> he sat down at the foot of a tree<br/> for noonday rest.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> rising at eventide from his solitude,<br/> went to Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda<br/> saw the venerable Sāriputta coming,<br/> while yet he was far off,<br/> and beholding the venerable Sāriputta<br/> he thus spake to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Calm are your senses, friend Sāriputta,<br/> clear and translucent<br/> the colour of your face.</p>

    <p class="f4">In what mood<br/> has the venerable Sāriputta<br/> been spending this day?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, passing utterly beyond the sphere of unbounded space,<br/> I have attained and have been dwelling in the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/> realizing:<br/> 'Infinite is consciousness.'</p>

    <p class="f4">To me thus, friend,<br/> the thought never came:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is I<br/> who am attaining the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/> realizing:<br/> "Infinite is consciousness."'</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is I<br/> who have attained the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/> realizing:<br/> "Infinite is consciousness."'</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is I<br/> who have emerged from the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/> realizing:<br/> "Infinite is consciousness."'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely for a long time<br/> have leanings to I-making,<br/> to mine-making<br/> and to vanity<br/> been well rooted out from the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is why it occurs not<br/> to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is I<br/> who am attaining the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/> realizing:<br/> "Infinite is consciousness."'</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is I<br/> who have attained the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/> realizing:<br/> "Infinite is consciousness."'</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is I<br/> who have emerged from the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/> realizing:<br/> "Infinite is consciousness."'"</p>
