    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying near Rājagaha<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> rising up at early dawn,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span> robed himself,<br/> and taking bowl and robe<br/> entered Rājagaha to beg for alms.</p>

    <p class="f4">After begging straight on from house to house<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>' in Rājagaha he was eating his meal, leaning against a certain wall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the wandering sister Pure-Face came up to the venerable Sāriputta and addressed him thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"0 recluse, why do you eat looking downwards?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do not eat looking downwards, sister."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, recluse, you are eating looking upwards."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do not eat looking upwards, sister."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the four quarters."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do not eat looking to the four quarters, sister."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the points between the four quarters."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do not eat, sister, looking to the points between the four quarters."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then how, forsooth, how are you eating, recluse?</p>

    <p class="f4">For when I question you<br/> '0 recluse, why do you eat looking downwards?'<br/> you answer:<br/> 'I do not eat looking downwards, sister.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When I question you<br/> 'Then, recluse, you are eating looking upwards.'<br/> you answer:<br/> 'I do not eat looking upwards, sister.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When I question you<br/> 'Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the four quarters.'<br/> you answer:<br/> 'I do not eat looking to the four quarters, sister.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When I question you<br/> 'Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the points between the four quarters.'<br/> you answer:<br/> 'I do not eat, sister, looking to the points between the four quarters.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br/> get their living in a wrong way<br/> by the practice of divination<br/> and of such low arts, -<br/> these, sister, are called<br/> 'recluses and brahmins who eat looking downwards.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br/> get their living in a wrong way<br/> by the practice of star-gazing<br/> and such low arts,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> -<br/> such as these, sister, are called<br/> 'recluses and brahmins who eat looking upward.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br/> get their living in a wrong way<br/> by the practice of sending messages<br/> and going errands,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> -<br/> such as these, sister, are called<br/> 'recluses and brahmins who eat looking to the four quarters.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span> Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br/> get their living in a wrong way<br/> by the practice of palmistry<br/> and such low arts, -<br/> these, sister, are called<br/> 'recluses and brahmins who eat looking to the points between the four quarters.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But I, sister, am one who gets his living<br/> in no one of these ways.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rightly do I seek my food,<br/> and rightly do I eat my food<br/> when I have sought it."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the wanderer Pure-Face<br/> roamed from street to street<br/> and from crossways to crossways<br/> in Rājagaha<br/> and thus proclaimed:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Rightly do the recluses<br/> who are sons of the Sakyan<br/> win their food.</p>

    <p class="f4">Blamelessly do the recluses<br/> who are sons of the Sakyan<br/> win their food.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye give alms<br/> to the recluses<br/> who are sons of the Sakyan."</p>
