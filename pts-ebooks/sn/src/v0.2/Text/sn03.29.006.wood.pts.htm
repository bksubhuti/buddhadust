    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One, and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is the reason, lord,<br/> what is the cause<br/> why some <i>nāgas</i> born without parents keep the Sabbath<br/> and divest themselves of their <i>nāga</i>-forms?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, brother, certain <i>nāgas</i> born without parents think thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Formerly we were double-dealing in speech,<br/> double-dealing in act,<br/> double-dealing in thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus in three ways being double-dealers,<br/> when body breaks up after death<br/> we shall be reborn in the company of <i>nāgas.</i> born without parents</p>

    <p class="f4">Now if we were to practise virtuous deeds,<br/> virtuous words<br/> and virtuous thoughts,<br/> when body breaks up after death<br/> we might be reborn in the happy state,<br/> in the heaven world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Come now,<br/> let us practise virtuous deeds,<br/> virtuous words<br/> and virtuous thoughts.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is the reason,<br/> this is the cause<br/> why certain <i>nāgas</i> born without parents<br/> keep the Sabbath<br/> and divest themselves of their <i>nāga</i>-forms."</p>
