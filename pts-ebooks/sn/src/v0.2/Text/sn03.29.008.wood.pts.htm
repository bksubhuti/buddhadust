    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is the reason, lord,<br/> what is the cause<br/> why a certain one,<br/> when body breaks up after death<br/> is reborn in the company of the womb-born nagas?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, brother, a certain one is<br/> a double-dealer in act,<br/> a double-dealer in word<br/> a double-dealer in thought.</p>

    <p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The womb-born <i>nāgas</i> are long-lived,<br/> fair to see<br/> and have much happiness."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he thinks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"0 that when body breaks up after death<br/> I might be born in the company<br/> of the womb-born <i>nāgas</i>!"</p>

    <p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/> a double-dealer in act,<br/> a double-dealer in word<br/> a double-dealer in thought<br/> is born in the company<br/> of the womb-born <i>nāgas</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the reason, brother,<br/> this is the cause<br/> why a certain one,<br/> when body breaks up after death<br/> is reborn in the company of the womb-born <i>nāgas.</i>"</p>
