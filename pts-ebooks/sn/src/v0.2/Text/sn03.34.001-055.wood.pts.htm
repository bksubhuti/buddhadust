    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward's abridgement if followed literally would read: "...but not skilled in fully expert therein." The Pali: <i>'Kallavā Kusala'</i> is 'fittingly skilled' or 'of sound skill'.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a></sup> §§ 8, 9, and 10 do not use 'skilled' here.</p>
