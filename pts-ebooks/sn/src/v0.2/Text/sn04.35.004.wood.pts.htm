    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Objects,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> brethren,<br/> are impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is ill,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine:<br/> I am not it:<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> with perfect insight<br/> of what it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Sounds are impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is ill,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine:<br/> I am not it:<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> with perfect insight<br/> of what it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Scents are impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is ill,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine:<br/> I am not it:<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> with perfect insight<br/> of what it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Savours are impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is ill,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine:<br/> I am not it:<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> with perfect insight<br/> of what it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Things tangible are impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is ill,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine:<br/> I am not it:<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> with perfect insight<br/> of what it really is.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Mind-states<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> are impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/> that is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is ill,<br/> that is void of the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/> that is not mine:<br/> I am not it:<br/> it is not my self.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/> with perfect insight<br/> of what it really is.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by objects,<br/> sounds,<br/> scents,<br/> savours,<br/> things tangible,<br/> and mind-states.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled by them,<br/> he lusts not for them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not lusting,<br/> he is set free.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this freedom<br/> comes insight of being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>
