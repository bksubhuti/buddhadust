    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The eye, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> cares not for an eye that is past,<br/> is not in love with an eye to be,<br/> and, for the present eye,<br/> seeks to be repelled by it,<br/> seeks dispassion for it,<br/> seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The ear, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The nose, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> cares not for a nose that is past,<br/> is not in love with a nose to be,<br/> and, for the present nose,<br/> seeks to be repelled by it,<br/> seeks dispassion for it,<br/> seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The tongue, brethren, is impermanent,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>
