    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Objects, brethren, are impermanent,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> cares not for an object that is past,<br/> is not in love with an object to be,<br/> and, for a present object,<br/> seeks to be repelled by it,<br/> seeks dispassion for it,<br/> seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sounds, brethren, are impermanent,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Scents, brethren, are impermanent,<br/> both in the past and in the future,<br/> not to speak of the present.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> cares not for a scent that is past,<br/> is not in love with a scent to be,<br/> and, for a present scent,<br/> seeks to be repelled by it,<br/> seeks dispassion for it,<br/> seeks the ceasing of it.</p>
