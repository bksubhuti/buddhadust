    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Before my enlightenment, brethren, while I was yet unenlightened and a Bodhisat, I had this thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br/> what is the misery of objects?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the way of escape from objects?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br/> what is the misery of the sounds?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the way of escape from sounds?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br/> what is the misery of scents?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the way of escape from scents?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br/> what is the misery of savours?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the way of escape from savours?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br/> what is the misery of things tactile?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the way of escape from things tactile?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br/> what is the misery of mind-states?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the way of escape from mind-states?'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, brethren, I thought thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That ease,<br/> that pleasure<br/> that arises owing to objects, -<br/> that is the satisfaction of objects.</p>

    <p class="f4">That impermanence,<br/> that ill,<br/> that instability<br/> which is objects, -<br/> that is the misery of objects.</p>

    <p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust,<br/> that renouncing of desire and lust<br/> which are in objects, -<br/> that is the way of escape from objects.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">That ease,<br/> that pleasure<br/> that arises owing to sounds, -<br/> that is the satisfaction of sounds.</p>

    <p class="f4">That impermanence,<br/> that ill,<br/> that instability<br/> which is sounds, -<br/> that is the misery of sounds.</p>

    <p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust,<br/> that renouncing of desire and lust<br/> which are in sounds, -<br/> that is the way of escape from sounds.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">That ease,<br/> that pleasure<br/> that arises owing to scents, -<br/> that is the satisfaction of scents.</p>

    <p class="f4">That impermanence,<br/> that ill,<br/> that instability<br/> which is scents, -<br/> that is the misery of scents.</p>

    <p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust,<br/> that renouncing of desire and lust<br/> which are in scents, -<br/> that is the way of escape from scents.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">That ease,<br/> that pleasure<br/> that arises owing to the savours, -<br/> that is the satisfaction of savours.</p>

    <p class="f4">That impermanence,<br/> that ill,<br/> that instability<br/> which is savours, -<br/> that is the misery of savours.</p>

    <p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust,<br/> that renouncing of desire and lust<br/> which are in savours, -<br/> that is the way of escape from savours.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">That ease,<br/> that pleasure<br/> that arises owing to things tangible, -<br/> that is the satisfaction of things tangible.</p>

    <p class="f4">That impermanence,<br/> that ill,<br/> that instability<br/> which is things tangible, -<br/> that is the misery of things tangible.</p>

    <p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust,<br/> that renouncing of desire and lust<br/> which are in things tangible, -<br/> that is the way of escape from things tangible.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">That ease,<br/> that pleasure<br/> that arises owing to mind-states, -<br/> that is the satisfaction of mind-states.</p>

    <p class="f4">That impermanence,<br/> that ill,<br/> that instability<br/> which is mind-states, -<br/> that is the misery of mind-states.</p>

    <p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust,<br/> that renouncing of desire and lust<br/> which are in mind-states, -<br/> that is the way of escape from mind-states.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now so long, brethren, as I did not thoroughly understand,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the satisfaction of this sixfold external sphere of sense as such,<br/> the misery of it as such,<br/> the way of escape from it as such, -<br/> so long, brethren, was I doubtful<br/> whether I was enlightened<br/> with that supreme enlightenment,<br/> unsurpassed in the world<br/> with its devas,<br/> its <i>Māras,</i><br/> its Brahmas,<br/> among the host of recluses and brahmins<br/> and of devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">But as soon, brethren, as I did thoroughly understand,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the satisfaction of this sixfold external sphere of sense as such,<br/> the misery of it as such,<br/> the way of escape from it as such, -<br/> no longer, brethren, was I doubtful<br/> whether I was enlightened<br/> with that supreme enlightenment,<br/> unsurpassed in the world<br/> with its devas,<br/> its <i>Māras,</i><br/> its Brahmas,<br/> among the host of recluses and brahmins<br/> and of devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then indeed the knowledge arose in me<br/> and insight arose in me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sure is my release.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my last birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no more rebirth for me now.'</p>
