    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, I practised the search after<br/> the satisfaction which is in objects,<br/> and to this conclusion I came:</p>

    <p class="f4">'In so far as there is satisfaction of objects,<br/> that by insight have I rightly seen.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Brethren, I practised the search after<br/> the misery which is in objects,<br/> and to this conclusion I came:</p>

    <p class="f4">'In so far as there is misery of objects,<br/> that by insight have I rightly seen.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Brethren, I practised the search after<br/> the way of escape from objects,<br/> and to this conclusion I came:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, I practised the search after<br/> the satisfaction which is in sounds,<br/> and to this conclusion I came:</p>

    <p class="f4">Brethren, I practised the search after<br/> the misery which is in sounds,<br/> and to this conclusion I came:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, I practised the search after<br/> the satisfaction which is in scents,<br/> and to this conclusion I came:</p>

    <p class="f4">'In so far as there is satisfaction of scents,<br/> that by insight have I rightly seen.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Brethren, I practised the search after<br/> the misery which is in scents,<br/> and to this conclusion I came:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, I practised the search after<br/> the satisfaction which is in savours,<br/> and to this conclusion I came:</p>

    <p class="f4">Brethren, I practised the search after<br/> the misery which is in savours,<br/> and to this conclusion I came:</p>

    <p class="f4">Brethren, I practised the search after<br/> the misery which is in mind-states,<br/> and to this conclusion I came:</p>

    <p class="f4">So long, brethren, as I did not thoroughly understand,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the satisfaction of this sixfold external sphere of sense as such,<br/> the misery of it as such,<br/> the way of escape from it as such, -<br/> so long, brethren, was I doubtful<br/> whether I was enlightened<br/> with that supreme enlightenment,<br/> unsurpassed in the world<br/> with its devas,<br/> its <i>Māras,</i><br/> its Brahmas,<br/> among the host of recluses and brahmins<br/> and of devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">But as soon, brethren, as I did thoroughly understand,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the satisfaction of this sixfold external sphere of sense as such,<br/> the misery of it as such,<br/> the way of escape from it as such, -<br/> no longer, brethren, was I doubtful<br/> whether I was enlightened<br/> with that supreme enlightenment,<br/> unsurpassed in the world<br/> with its devas,<br/> its <i>Māras,</i><br/> its Brahmas,<br/> among the host of recluses and brahmins<br/> and of devas and men.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then indeed the knowledge arose in me<br/> and insight arose in me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sure is my release.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my last birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no more rebirth for me now.'</p>
