    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the eye,<br/> beings would not lust after the eye.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the eye,<br/> therefore beings lust after the eye.</p>

    <p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to the eye,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the eye.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in the eye,<br/> beings are repelled by the eye.</p>

    <p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from the eye,<br/> beings could not escape from the eye.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from the eye,<br/> beings do escape from the eye.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the ear,<br/> beings would not lust after the ear.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the ear,<br/> therefore beings lust after the ear.</p>

    <p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to the ear,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the ear.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in the ear,<br/> beings are repelled by the ear.</p>

    <p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from the ear,<br/> beings could not escape from the ear.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from the eye,<br/> beings do escape from the ear.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the nose,<br/> beings would not lust after the nose.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the nose,<br/> therefore beings lust after the nose.</p>

    <p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to the nose,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the nose.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in the nose,<br/> beings are repelled by the ear.</p>

    <p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from the nose,<br/> beings could not escape from the nose.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from the nose,<br/> beings do escape from the nose.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the tongue,<br/> beings would not lust after the tongue.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the tongue,<br/> therefore beings lust after the tongue.</p>

    <p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to the tongue,<br/> beings would not be repelled by the tongue.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in the tongue,<br/> beings are repelled by the tongue.</p>

    <p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from the tongue,<br/> beings could not escape from the tongue.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from the tongue,<br/> beings do escape from the tongue.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the body,<br/> beings would not lust after the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the body,<br/> therefore beings lust after the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from the mind,<br/> beings do escape from the mind.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">So long, Brethren, as beings have not understood,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the satisfaction as such,<br/> the misery as such,<br/> the way of escape as such,<br/> in this sixfold personal sphere of sense,<br/> so long, Brethren, beings have not remained aloof,<br/> detached,<br/> separated,<br/> with the barriers to the mind<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> done away with,<br/> nor have the world<br/> and its devas,<br/> its <i>Māras,</i><br/> its Brahmas,<br/> nor the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/> of devas and mankind.</p>

    <p class="f4">But so soon, Brethren, as beings thoroughly understand,<br/> as they really are<br/> the satisfaction as such,<br/> the misery as such,<br/> the way of escape as such,<br/> in this sixfold personal sphere of sense,<br/> then, Brethren, beings and the world<br/> and its devas,<br/> its <i>Māras,</i><br/> its Brahmas,<br/> and the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/> of devas and mankind<br/> do remain aloof,<br/> detached,<br/> separated,<br/> with the barriers to the mind done away with.</p>
