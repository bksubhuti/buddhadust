    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from objects,<br/> beings would not lust after objects.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in objects,<br/> therefore beings lust after objects.</p>

    <p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to objects,<br/> beings would not be repelled by objects.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in objects,<br/> beings are repelled by objects.</p>

    <p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from objects,<br/> beings could not escape from objects.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from objects,<br/> beings do escape from objects.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from things tactile,<br/> beings would not lust after things tactile.</p>

    <p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in things tactile,<br/> therefore beings lust after things tactile.</p>

    <p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to things tactile,<br/> beings would not be repelled by things tactile.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">So long, Brethren, as beings have not understood,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the satisfaction as such,<br/> the misery as such,<br/> the way of escape as such,<br/> in this sixfold external sphere of sense,<br/> so long, Brethren, beings have not remained aloof,<br/> detached,<br/> separated,<br/> with the barriers to the mind nor have the world<br/> and its devas,<br/> its <i>Māras,</i><br/> its Brahmas,<br/> nor the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/> of devas and mankind.</p>

    <p class="f4">But so soon, Brethren, as beings thoroughly understand,<br/> as they really are<br/> the satisfaction as such,<br/> the misery as such,<br/> the way of escape as such,<br/> in this sixfold external sphere of sense,<br/> then, Brethren, beings and the world<br/> and its devas,<br/> its <i>Māras,</i><br/> its Brahmas,<br/> and the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/> of devas and mankind<br/> do remain aloof,<br/> detached,<br/> separated,<br/> with the barriers to the mind done away with.</p>
