    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whoso, Brethren, takes delight in objects,<br/> takes delight in ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso takes delight in ill,<br/> is not released from ill,<br/> I declare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whoso, Brethren, takes delight in sounds,<br/> takes delight in ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso takes delight in ill,<br/> is not released from ill,<br/> I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whoso, Brethren, takes delight in things tactile,<br/> takes delight in ill.</p>
