    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"That, Brethren, which is the uprising,<br/> the persisting,<br/> the rebirth,<br/> the manifestation of the eye, -<br/> that is the uprising of ill,<br/> the persisting of diseases,<br/> the manifestation of decay and death.</p>
