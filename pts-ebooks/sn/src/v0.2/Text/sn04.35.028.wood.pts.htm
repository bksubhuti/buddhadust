    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Gaya<br/> on Gaya Head<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> with a thousand brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said to the brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, the all is on fire.</p>

    <p class="f4">What all, brethren, is on fire?</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye, brethren, is on fire,<br/> objects are on fire,<br/> eye-consciousness, is on fire,<br/> eye-contact, is on fire,<br/> that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to eye-contact,-<br/> that also is on fire.</p>

    <p class="f4">On fire with what?</p>

    <p class="f4">On fire with the blaze of lust,<br/> on fire with the blaze of ill-will,<br/> on fire with the blaze of infatuation,<br/> on fire with the blaze of birth,<br/> on fire with decay and death,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear, brethren, is on fire,<br/> sounds are on fire,<br/> ear-consciousness, is on fire,<br/> ear-contact, is on fire,<br/> that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to ear-contact,-<br/> that also is on fire.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue, brethren, is on fire,<br/> savours are on fire,<br/> tongue-consciousness, is on fire,<br/> tongue-contact, is on fire,<br/> that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to tongue-contact,-<br/> that also is on fire.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">The body, brethren, is on fire,<br/> things tangible are on fire,<br/> body consciousness, is on fire,<br/> body-contact, is on fire,<br/> that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to body-contact,-<br/> that also is on fire.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ṭriyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the eye,<br/> is repelled by objects,<br/> is repelled by eye-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by eye-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to eye-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ṭriyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the ear,<br/> is repelled by sounds,<br/> is repelled by ear-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by ear-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to ear-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ṭriyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the nose,<br/> is repelled by scents,<br/> is repelled by nose-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by nose-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to nose-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ṭriyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the tongue,<br/> is repelled by savours,<br/> is repelled by tongue-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by tongue-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to tongue-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ṭriyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the body,<br/> is repelled by things tactile,<br/> is repelled by body-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by body-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to body-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ṭriyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the mind,<br/> is repelled by mind-states,<br/> is repelled by mind-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by mind-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to mind-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled by these,<br/> he lusts not for them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not lusting he is set free.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this freedom<br/> comes insight<br/> that it is a being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task.</p>

    <p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One,<br/> and those brethren were pleased<br/> at the words of the Exalted One<br/> and welcomed them.</p>

    <p class="f4">And when the teaching was thus expounded<br/> the hearts of those thousand brethren<br/> were utterly set free from the <i>āsavas.</i></p>
