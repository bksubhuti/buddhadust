    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha, in Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, the all is afflicted.</p>

    <p class="f4">What all, Brethren, is afflicted?</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye, brethren, is afflicted,<br/> objects are afflicted,<br/> eye-consciousness, is afflicted,<br/> eye-contact, is afflicted,<br/> that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to eye-contact,-<br/> that also is afflicted.</p>

    <p class="f4">Afflicted with what?</p>

    <p class="f4">Afflicted with birth,<br/> decay and death,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear, brethren, is afflicted,<br/> sounds are afflicted,<br/> ear consciousness, is afflicted,<br/> ear-contact, is afflicted,<br/> that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to ear-contact,-<br/> that also is afflicted.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose, brethren, is afflicted,<br/> scents are afflicted,<br/> nose-consciousness, is afflicted,<br/> nose-contact, is afflicted,<br/> that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to nose-contact,-<br/> that also is afflicted.</p>

    <p class="f4">Afflicted with what?</p>

    <p class="f4">Afflicted with birth,<br/> decay and death,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Afflicted with what?</p>

    <p class="f4">Afflicted with birth,<br/> decay and death,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">The body, brethren, is afflicted,<br/> things tangible are afflicted,<br/> body consciousness, is afflicted,<br/> body-contact, is afflicted,<br/> that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to body-contact,-<br/> that also is afflicted.</p>

    <p class="f4">Afflicted with what?</p>

    <p class="f4">Afflicted with birth,<br/> decay and death,<br/> sorrow and grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind, brethren, is afflicted,<br/> mind-states are afflicted,<br/> mind-consciousness, is afflicted,<br/> mind-contact, is afflicted,<br/> that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to mind-contact,-<br/> that also is afflicted.</p>

    <p class="f4">Afflicted with what?</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ṭriyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the eye,<br/> is repelled by objects,<br/> is repelled by eye-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by eye-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to eye-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled by these,<br/> he lusts not for them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not lusting he is set free.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this freedom<br/> comes insight<br/> that it is a being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task.</p>

    <p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>
