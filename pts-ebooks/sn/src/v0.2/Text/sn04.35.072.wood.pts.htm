    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> brother, Brethren, understands not,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising and destruction,<br/> the satisfaction and misery,<br/> and the escape<br/> from the sixfold sphere of contact, -<br/> not lived by such an one<br/> is the righteous life.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, lord, I am in despair; -<br/> for I, lord, do not understand these things<br/> as they really are."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now what think you, brother?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you regard the eye thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is mine.</p>
