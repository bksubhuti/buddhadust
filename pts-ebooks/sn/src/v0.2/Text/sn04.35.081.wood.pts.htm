    <p class="f4">At Sāvatthī was the occasion (for this discourse)</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of brethren came to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As they sat at one side those brethren said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now here, lord, the wandering sectarians thus question us:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What is the object, friend,<br/> for which the holy life is lived<br/> under the rule of Gotama the recluse?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus questioned, lord,<br/> we thus make answer to those wandering sectarians:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is for the full knowledge of ill<br/> that the holy life is lived<br/> under the rule of the Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, when, thus questioned,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> we so make answer,<br/> do we state the views of the Exalted One,<br/> without misrepresenting the Exalted One<br/> by stating an untruth?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do we answer in accordance with his teaching,<br/> so that no one who agrees with his teaching<br/> and follows his views<br/> could incur reproach?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Truly, Brethren, when thus questioned<br/> you thus make answer,<br/> ye do state my views<br/> without misrepresenting me<br/> by stating an untruth.</p>

    <p class="f4">You do answer in accordance with my teaching,<br/> so that no one who agrees with my teaching<br/> and follows my views<br/> could incur reproach<br/> in stating that it is for the full knowledge of ill<br/> that the holy life is lived under my rule.</p>

    <p class="f4">But if, Brethren, the wandering sectarians should thus question you:</p>

    <p class="f4">'But what, friend, is that ill,<br/> for the full knowledge of which<br/> the holy life is lived under the rule of Gotama the recluse?' -</p>
