    <p><span class="f2">[55]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[30]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha<br/> in Bamboo Grove,<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta the venerable Cunda, the Great<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> and the venerable Channa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> were staying on Vulture's Peak.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time the venerable Channa was sick, afflicted, stricken with a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta, at eventide rising from his solitude, went to visit the venerable Cunda, and on coming to him said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let us go, friend Cunda, to visit the venerable Channa and ask about his sickness."</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Cunda the Great assented, saying,</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very well, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">So they two went to visit the venerable Channa, and on reaching him sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">On sitting down the venerable Sāriputta said to the venerable Channa:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, friend, I hope you are bearing up.</p>

    <p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do your pains abate and not increase?</p>

    <p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating and not increasing?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"No, friend Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not bearing up.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating, but of their increasing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if, friend, a strong man<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> with a sharp-pointed sword were crashing into my brain, just so, friend, does the strong rush of vital air torment my brain.</p>

    <p class="f4">No, friend, I am not bearing up, I am not enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if, friend, a skilful butcher or butcher's apprentice with a sharp butcher's knife were ripping up my belly, even <span class="f2 g"><b>[31]</b></span> so strong, friend, are the winds that rack my belly.</p>

    <p class="f4">No, friend, I am not bearing up, I am not enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if, friend, two strong men should lay hold of some weaker man, seizing him each by an arm, and should scorch and burn him in a pit of glowing charcoal, even so scorching, friend, is the burning in my body.</p>

    <p class="f4">No, friend, I am not bearing up, I am not enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating, but of their increasing.</p>

    <p class="f4">I'll use the knife,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> friend Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">I wish to live no longer."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let not the venerable Channa use the knife.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let the venerable Channa bear up.</p>

    <p class="f4">We want the venerable Channa to bear up.</p>

    <p class="f4">If the venerable Channa has no proper food, I will search for proper food for him.</p>

    <p class="f4">If the venerable Channa has no proper medicine, I will search for proper medicine for him.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he has no fit attendants, I will wait on the venerable Channa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let not the venerable Channa use the knife.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let him bear up.</p>

    <p class="f4">We want the venerable Channa to bear up."</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, friend Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not without proper food.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have it.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not without proper medicine.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have it.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not without fit attendants.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have them.</p>

    <p class="f4">I myself, friend, waited on the Master for many a long day with service that was delightful, not tedious.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, friend, is the proper thing for a disciple to do."</p>

    <p class="f4">'In so far as he served the Master with a service that was delightful, not tedious, blameless<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> (must be accounted) the brother Channa's use of the knife':</p>
