    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> The Pali begins "There then ..." which would indicate by reference to the previous sutta which in the text has a similar nidana, that this sutta was delivered in Rājagaha, the location of the sutta prior to that one. But the previous sutta was, according to MN 145 actually delivered in Sāvatthi, so I take it that this "There..." indicates Sāvatthi, not Rājagaha.</p>
