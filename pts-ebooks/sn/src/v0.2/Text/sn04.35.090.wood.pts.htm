    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Passion,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> Brethren, is a disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Passion is an imposthume.</p>

    <p class="f4">Passion is a dart.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, Brethren, the Tathāgata abides passionless and unwounded.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, Brethren, if one should so desire,<br/> he also might abide passionless and unwounded.</p>
