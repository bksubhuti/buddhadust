    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Owing to a dual (thing), Brethren,<br/> consciousness comes into being.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is that dual<br/> owing to which consciousness comes into being?</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the eye and objects<br/> arises eye-consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye is impermanent,<br/> changing,<br/> its state is 'becoming otherness.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Objects are impermanent,<br/> changing,<br/> their state is 'becoming otherness.'.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus this dual —<br/> mobile<br/> and transitory,<br/> impermanent,<br/> changing, -<br/> its state is 'becoming otherness.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Eye-consciousness is impermanent,<br/> changing,<br/> its state is 'becoming otherness.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That condition,<br/> that relation of the uprising of eye-consciousness, -<br/> they also are impermanent,<br/> changing,<br/> their state is 'becoming otherness.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This eye-consciousness,<br/> arising as it does from an impermanent relation, -<br/> how could it be permanent?</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the striking together,<br/> the falling together,<br/> the meeting together<br/> of these three things, -<br/> this, Brethren, is called 'eye-contact.'</p>
