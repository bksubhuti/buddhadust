    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">There then he addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are these six spheres of contact, Brethren,<br/> which are untamed,<br/> unguarded,<br/> unwatched,<br/> unrestrained,<br/> bringers of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye, brethren, is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is untamed,<br/> unguarded,<br/> unwatched,<br/> unrestrained,<br/> a bringer of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is untamed,<br/> unguarded,<br/> unwatched,<br/> unrestrained,<br/> a bringer of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is untamed,<br/> unguarded,<br/> unwatched,<br/> unrestrained,<br/> a bringer of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is untamed,<br/> unguarded,<br/> unwatched,<br/> unrestrained,<br/> a bringer of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The body, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is untamed,<br/> unguarded,<br/> unwatched,<br/> unrestrained,<br/> a bringer of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is untamed,<br/> unguarded,<br/> unwatched,<br/> unrestrained,<br/> a bringer of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the six spheres of contact, Brethren,<br/> which are untamed,<br/> unguarded,<br/> unwatched,<br/> unrestrained,<br/> bringers of ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these six spheres of contact, Brethren,<br/> which are well tamed,<br/> well guarded,<br/> well watched,<br/> well restrained,<br/> bringers of happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is well tamed,<br/> well guarded,<br/> well watched,<br/> well restrained,<br/> a bringer of happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is well tamed,<br/> well guarded,<br/> well watched,<br/> well restrained,<br/> a bringer of happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is well tamed,<br/> well guarded,<br/> well watched,<br/> well restrained,<br/> a bringer of happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is well tamed,<br/> well guarded,<br/> well watched,<br/> well restrained,<br/> a bringer of happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The body, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is well tamed,<br/> well guarded,<br/> well watched,<br/> well restrained,<br/> a bringer of happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind, brethren is a sphere of contact,<br/> which is well tamed,<br/> well guarded,<br/> well watched,<br/> well restrained,<br/> a bringer of happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the six spheres of contact, Brethren,<br/> which are well tamed,<br/> well guarded,<br/> well watched,<br/> well restrained,<br/> bringers of happiness."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Well-Farer having thus spoken,<br/> the Master added this further: -</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">He meets with ill, Brethren, who has not tamed<br/> The sixfold impact of the sphere of sense.<br/> They who have learned the mastery of these,<br/> With faith for comrade, - they dwell free from lust.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Beholding with the eye delightful things<br/> Or things unlovely, let him restrain his bent<br/> To lust for loveliness; - and let him not<br/> Corrupt his heart with thoughts of 'O 'tis dear.'</p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span> And when, again, sounds sweet or harsh he hears,<br/> Not led astray by sweetness, let him check<br/> The error of his senses. Let him not<br/> Corrupt his heart with thoughts of '0 'tis sweet.'</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">If some delightful fragrance meet the nose,<br/> And then again some foul malodorous stench,<br/> Let him restrain repugnance for that stench,<br/> Nor yet be led by lust for what is sweet.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Should he taste savours that are sweet and choice,<br/> And then again what's bitter to the tongue,<br/> He should not greedily devour the sweet,<br/> Nor yet show loathing<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> for the bitter taste.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">By pleasures' impact not inebriate,<br/> Nor yet distracted by the touch of pain,<br/> To pain and pleasure both indifferent<br/> Let him be free from likings and dislikes.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Obsessed (by lusts) are others:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> so obsessed<br/> They know and so they fare. But he dispels<br/> All the world's vulgar fashionings of mind,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> And treads the path renunciation-bound.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4 in2">By contact of these six, if mind be trained,<br/> The heart is never shaken any more.<br/> O'ercome these two, O Brethren, - lust and hate.<br/> Pass ye beyond the bounds of birth and death.</p>
