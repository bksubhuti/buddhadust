    <p class="f4">I will teach you, brethren, of one whose nature is to fall back, and of one whose nature is not to fall back: also the six<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> stations of the conqueror.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, brethren, is one of a nature to fall back?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, at sight of an object, evil, unprofitable states arise in a brother, memories and plans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> akin to the fetters that bind.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother welcomes that object, rejects it not, puts it not away, wipes it not out, does not make it go to utter destruction, thus should a brother understand of it:<br/> 'In profitable states I fall back.<br/> This was called by the Exalted One "falling back."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, brethren, on tasting a savour with the tongue ... on cognizing a mind-state with the mind, evil unprofitable states arise in a brother, memories and hopes akin to the fetters that bind.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother welcomes that state, rejects it not, puts it not away, wipes it not out, does not make it go to utter destruction, thus should he understand <span class="f3"><b>[46]</b></span> of it:<br/> 'I am falling back in profitable states.<br/> This was called by the Exalted One "falling back."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, brethren, is one whose nature is to fall back.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, brethren, is one of a nature not to fall back?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, at sight of an object, evil, unprofitable states arise in a brother, memories and hopes akin to the fetters that bind.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother welcomes not that object, rejects it, puts it away, wipes it out, makes it go to utter destruction, thus should he understand of it:<br/> 'In profitable states I am not falling back.<br/> This was called by the Exalted One<br/> "not falling back."'</p>

    <p class="f4">So also on tasting a savour with the tongue ... on cognizing a mind-state with the mind ... If a brother welcomes not that state, puts it away ... thus should he understand of it:<br/> 'I am not falling back in profitable states. ...'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the six stations of mastery?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, on seeing an object with the eye evil unprofitable states do not arise in a brother, memories and hopes akin to the fetters that bind.</p>

    <p class="f4">In such case, brethren, thus should a brother understand:<br/> 'Mastered is this sense-sphere. This was called "a station of mastery" by the Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the same is to be said of the tongue and mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, brethren, are called 'the six stations of mastery.'</p>
