    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, Brethren, restraint<br/> and lack of restraint.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is one unrestrained?</p>

    <p class="f4">There are, Brethren, objects cognizable by the eye,<br/> objects desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am falling back in profitable states.</p>
