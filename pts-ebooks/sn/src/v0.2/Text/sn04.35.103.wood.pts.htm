    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It was Uddaka,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> Brethren,<br/> the son of Rama,<br/> who spoke these words:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Lo! Versed in lore,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> all-conqueror am I!<br/> 'Tis I that have dug out the root of ill,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> Not rooted out before.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to that, Brethren,<br/> Uddaka, son of Rama,<br/> though unversed in lore,<br/> exclaims:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Versed in lore am I.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Though he was no conqueror of all,<br/> he exclaims:</p>

    <p class="f4">'All-conqueror am I.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[50]</b></span> Though the root of ill was not uprooted,<br/> yet he exclaims:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I have dug out the root of ill,<br/> not rooted out before.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein, Brethren, a brother would be right in saying:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Lo! Versed in lore, all-conqueror am I!<br/> 'Tis I that have dug out the root of ill,<br/> Not rooted out before.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother<br/> versed in lore?</p>

    <p class="f4">In so far as he understands,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising,<br/> the destruction,<br/> the satisfaction,<br/> the misery,<br/> the way of escape<br/> from the sixfold sphere of sense, -<br/> that is how a brother is versed in lore.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother<br/> all-conqueror?</p>

    <p class="f4">In so far as he sees,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising,<br/> the destruction,<br/> the satisfaction,<br/> the misery,<br/> the way of escape<br/> from the sixfold sphere of sense, -<br/> he is freed without grasping, -<br/> that is how a brother is all-conqueror.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother<br/> one who has dug out the root of ill,<br/> that imposthume not rooted out before?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Imposthume,' Brethren,<br/> is a term for this body,<br/> of the four elements compounded,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> of parents sprung,<br/> on rice and gruel fed,<br/> impermanent,<br/> of a nature to be worn away,<br/> pounded away,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> broken<br/> and scattered.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Root of the imposthume,' Brethren,<br/> is a term for craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">When a brother has rooted out craving,<br/> cut it down at the root,<br/> made it like a palm-tree stump,<br/> made it something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot grow up again in future time, -<br/> that, Brethren, is how a brother<br/> has rooted up the root of the imposthume,<br/> never rooted out before.</p>

    <p class="f4">It was Uddaka, Rāma's son, Brethren, who said:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Lo! Versed in lore, all-conqueror am I!<br/> 'Tis I that have dug out the root of ill,<br/> Not rooted out before.</p>

    <p class="f4">But a brother (who has dug out the root of -craving) might well indeed exclaim:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Lo! Versed in lore, all-conqueror am I!<br/> 'Tis I that have dug out the root of ill,<br/> Not rooted out before.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Jātu vedagu. Jātu</i> is a doubtful word, used as an adverb. Sanskrit dictionaries derive it from <i>jantu</i> (man), and it generally means 'ever,' 'surely.' Possibly it is for <i>jānātu</i> ('take notice '), as I translate here. <i>Cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> i, 178 <i>n.</i> <i>Comy.</i> has <i>ekaṅsena vedagū, veda-sañkhātena ñāṇena ñeyyesu gato, pandit' asmi.</i><br/> <i>Idaṅ:</i> See here! <i>Ecce!

Text reads <i>palikhitaṅ,</i> but <i>Comy.</i> has <i>apalikhitaṅ,</i> expl. as <i>apalikhataṅ.</i> We mast read <i>palikhataṅ,</i> as in the repetition below, for the sake of the metre, but the Buddha's quotation seems to favour <i>apalihhataṅ</i> in the <i>gāthā,</i> and I have translated accordingly.</p>
