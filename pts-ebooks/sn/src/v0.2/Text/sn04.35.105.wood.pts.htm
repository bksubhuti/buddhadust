    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Owing to the existence of what, Brethren,<br/> dependent on what,<br/> does this personal weal or woe arise?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span> "For us, lord,<br/> things have the Exalted One as their root,<br/> their guide<br/> and their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed were it if the meaning<br/> of this that he has spoken<br/> were to manifest itself to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing it from him,<br/> the brethren will remember it."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, brethren, listen, give your mind thoroughly and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, lord," responded those brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Where you<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> have eye, Brethren,<br/> dependent on eye<br/> arises one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Where you have ear, Brethren,<br/> dependent on eye<br/> arises one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Where you have nose, Brethren,<br/> dependent on eye<br/> arises one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Where you have tongue, Brethren,<br/> dependent on eye<br/> arises one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Where you have body, Brethren,<br/> dependent on eye<br/> arises one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Where you have mind, Brethren,<br/> dependent on eye<br/> arises one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think ye, brethren?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the eye permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"And what is impermanent,<br/> is that woe or weal?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then what is impermanent,<br/> woeful,<br/> unstable in nature, -<br/> is it fitting to regard that as:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is mine;<br/> this am I;<br/> this is the Self of me?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"So seeing, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is averse from the eye<br/> is averse from the ear<br/> is averse from the nose<br/> is averse from the tongue<br/> is averse from the body<br/> is averse from the the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being averse,<br/> he lusts not.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not lusting,<br/> he is set free.</p>

    <p class="f4">By being free<br/> comes the knowledge that one is free.</p>

    <p class="f4">So that he realizes:</p>
