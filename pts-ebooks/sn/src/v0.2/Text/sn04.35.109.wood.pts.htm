    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, Brethren,<br/> the things that make for bondage<br/> and the fetter.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Brethren, are the things that make for bondage<br/> and what is the fetter?</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye, Brethren, is a thing that makes for bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is the fetter of the eye.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear, Brethren, is a thing that makes for bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is the fetter of the ear.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose, Brethren, is a thing that makes for bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is the fetter of the nose.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue, Brethren, is a thing that makes for bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is the fetter of the tongue.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The body, Brethren, is a thing that makes for bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is the fetter of the body.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind, Brethren, is a thing that makes for bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is the fetter of the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, Brethren, are called<br/> 'the things that make for bondage,'<br/> and this is the fetter.</p>
