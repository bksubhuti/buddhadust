    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, Brethren,<br/> the things that make for grasping<br/> and grasping.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Brethren, are the things that make for grasping<br/> and what is grasping?</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye, Brethren, is a thing that makes for grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is grasping of the eye.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear, Brethren, is a thing that makes for grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is grasping of the ear.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose, Brethren, is a thing that makes for grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is grasping of the nose.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue, Brethren, is a thing that makes for grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is grasping of the tongue.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The body, Brethren, is a thing that makes for grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is grasping of the body.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind, Brethren, is a thing that makes for grasping.</p>

    <p class="f4">The desire and lust that are therein, -<br/> that is grasping of the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, Brethren, are called<br/> 'the things that make for grasping,'<br/> and this is grasping.</p>
