    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"By not comprehending,<br/> by not understanding,<br/> without detaching himself from,<br/> without abandoning<br/> objects,<br/> one is incapable of the destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">By not comprehending,<br/> by not understanding,<br/> without detaching himself from,<br/> without abandoning<br/> sounds,<br/> one is incapable of the destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">By not comprehending,<br/> by not understanding,<br/> without detaching himself from,<br/> without abandoning<br/> scents,<br/> one is incapable of the destruction of ill.</p>
