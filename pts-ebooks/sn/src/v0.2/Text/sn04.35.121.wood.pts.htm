    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then as the Exalted One was meditating in solitude this <span class="f2 g"><b>[65]</b></span> thought occurred to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Ripe now in Rāhula<br/> are those states<br/> that bring release to perfection.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose now I give Rāhula<br/> the last teachings<br/> for the destruction of the <i>āsavas.</i></p>

    <p class="f4">So the Exalted One,<br/> robing himself at early dawn,<br/> and taking bowl and robe<br/> set out for Sāvatthī on his begging-round,<br/> and after completing his round<br/> and eating his meal,<br/> said to the venerable Rahula: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Rāhula, take a mat.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let us go to Dark Wood<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> for the noonday rest."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very good, lord,"<br/> replied the venerable Rāhula to the Exalted One,<br/> and taking a mat<br/> followed behind<br/> in the footsteps of the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time<br/> countless thousands of devas<br/> were following the Exalted One, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">"To-day the Exalted One will give the venerable Rāhula<br/> the last teachings<br/> for the destruction of the <i>āsavas.</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Exalted One plunged into the depths of Dark Wood<br/> and sat down at the foot of a certain tree<br/> on the seat prepared for him.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Rāhula,<br/> saluting the Exalted One,<br/> sat down also at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/> the Exalted One said to the venerable Rāhula: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now what think you, Rāhula?</p>
