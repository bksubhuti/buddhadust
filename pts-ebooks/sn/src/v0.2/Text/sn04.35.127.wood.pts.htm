    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Piṇḍola,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of Bhāradvāja,<br/> was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the rajah Udena went to see the venerable Piṇḍola,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him in friendly wise,<br/> and after the exchange of courtesies and greetings<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the rajah Udena said to him: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is the condition, Master Bhāradvāja,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> what is the cause<br/> whereby the young Brethren,<br/> who are mere lads with jet-black hair,<br/> blessed with happy youth,<br/> who in the flower of their life<br/> have had no dalliance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> with the passions,<br/> yet practise the righteous life<br/> in its fullness and perfection<br/> and live out their span of life to the full?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"It has been said, Mahārajah, by that Exalted One<br/> who knows,<br/> who sees,<br/> by that Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come ye, brethren;<br/> in the case of those who are just mothers,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> sisters<br/> and daughters,<br/> do ye call up the mother-mind,<br/> the sister-mind,<br/> the daughter-mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the condition, Mahārajah,<br/> that is the cause<br/> whereby these young Brethren,<br/> who are mere lads with jet-black hair,<br/> blessed with happy youth,<br/> who in the flower of their life<br/> have had no dalliance with the passions,<br/> yet practise the righteous life<br/> in its fullness and perfection<br/> and live out their span of life to the full."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"The heart is wanton, Bhāradvāja.</p>

    <p class="f4">It may well be<br/> that at times<br/> mind-states that are wanton<br/> arise in the case of those <span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span> who are mother,<br/> sister<br/> and daughter.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, Bhāradvāja, is there any other condition,<br/> any other cause<br/> whereby these young Brethren,<br/> who are mere lads with jet-black hair,<br/> blessed with happy youth,<br/> who in the flower of their life<br/> have had no dalliance with the passions,<br/> yet practise the righteous life<br/> in its fullness and perfection<br/> and live out their span of life to the full?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come ye, Brethren,<br/> look upon this same body,<br/> upwards from the soles of the feet,<br/> downwards from the top of the head,<br/> enclosed by skin,<br/> full of manifold impurities.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are in this body<br/> hair of the head,<br/> hair of the body,<br/> nails,<br/> skin,<br/> teeth,<br/> flesh,<br/> nerves,<br/> bones,<br/> marrow,<br/> kidneys,<br/> heart,<br/> liver,<br/> pleura,<br/> spleen,<br/> lungs,<br/> intestines,<br/> mesentery,<br/> stomach,<br/> faeces,<br/> bile,<br/> phlegm,<br/> matter,<br/> blood,<br/> sweat,<br/> lymph,<br/> fat,<br/> tears,<br/> lubricant,<br/> saliva,<br/> mucus,<br/> oil,<br/> urine.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Mahārajah, is the condition,<br/> that is the cause<br/> whereby these young brethren,<br/> who are mere lads with jet-black hair,<br/> blessed with happy youth,<br/> who in the flower of their life<br/> have had no dalliance with the passions,<br/> yet practise the righteous life<br/> in its fullness and perfection<br/> and live out their span of life to the full."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, master Bhāradvāja,<br/> that is easy fox those brethren<br/> who train the body,<br/> who train in morals,<br/> who train the mind<br/> who train in insight,<br/> but for those||<br/> who do not train the body,<br/> who do not train in morals,<br/> who do not train the mind<br/> who do not train in insight,<br/> it is a hard thing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Maybe at times, master Bhāradvāja,<br/> when one is thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will regard it as unlovely',</p>

    <p class="f4">he comes to regard it as lovely.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This, Mahārajah, is the condition, this is the cause whereby these young Brethren,<br/> who are mere lads with jet-black hair,<br/> blessed with happy youth,<br/> who in the flower of their life<br/> have had no dalliance with the passions,<br/> yet practise the righteous life<br/> in its fullness and perfection<br/> and live out their span of life to the full."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wonderful, master Bhāradvāja!</p>

    <p class="f4">Marvellous it is, master Bhāradvāja, how well spoken are these words of that Exalted One, who knows, who sees, that Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Surely that is the condition,<br/> that is the cause, master Bhāradvāja,<br/> whereby these young brethren,<br/> who are mere lads with jet-black hair,<br/> blessed with happy youth,<br/> who in the flower of their life<br/> have had no dalliance with the passions,<br/> yet practise the righteous life<br/> in its fullness and perfection<br/> and live out their span of life to the full.</p>

    <p class="f4">I myself, master Bhāradvāja,<br/> whenever I enter my palace with body,<br/> speech<br/> and mind unguarded,<br/> with thought unsettled,<br/> with my faculties uncontrolled, -<br/> at such times lustful states overwhelm me.</p>

    <p class="f4">But whenever, master Bhāradvāja,<br/> whenever I enter my palace with body,<br/> speech<br/> and mind guarded,<br/> with thought settled,<br/> with my faculties controlled, -<br/> at such times lustful states do not overwhelm me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent, master Bhāradvāja!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent it is, master Bhāradvāja!</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br/> or shows forth what is hidden,<br/> or points out the way<br/> to him that wanders astray,<br/> or holds up a light in the darkness,<br/> so that they who have eyes may see objects, -<br/> even so in divers ways<br/> has the Norm been set forth by the worthy Bhāradvāja.</p>

    <p class="f4">I myself, master Bhāradvāja,<br/> do go for refuge to that Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the worthy Bhāradvāja accept me as a follower<br/> from this day forth,<br/> so long as life doth last,<br/> as one who has so taken refuge."</p>

For Piṇḍola ("scrap-gatherer') see also <i>Itivuttaka,</i> § 91; <i>K.S.</i> iii, 93, [but ? should this not be SN 3 page 93 = KS 3 §80] <i>Jāt.</i> iv, 375. At A. i, 23 (A.A. 196) he is proclaimed by the Master as "best at the lion's roar'.<br/> Bhāradvāja is on the river Jumna, the capital of the Vaṅsas, about 230 miles from Benares.
