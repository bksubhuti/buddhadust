    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Ānanda was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the house-father Ghosita came to see the venerable Ānanda,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him in friendly wise,<br/> and after the exchange of courtesies and greetings<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said this to the venerable Ānanda:-</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Diversity in elements! Diversity in elements!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> is the saying, my lord Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, sir, how far has diversity in elements<br/> been spoken of by the Exalted One?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"When the elements of eye<br/> and objects that are pleasing<br/> and eye-consciousness occur together, house-father,<br/> owing to the pleasurable contact<br/> there arises pleasurable feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">When the elements of eye,<br/> objects that are displeasing<br/> and eye-consciousness occur together,<br/> owing to the unpleasant contact resulting<br/> there arises painful feeling.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward abridges indicating he would use 'objects' for each of the objects of sense, but this is likely just an oversight (resulting, I would say, from the use of 'objects' for the object of the eye sense where 'shape' is the better and usual translation for <i>'rūpa'</i>). The Pali and all his previous translations have named the objects of sense in accordance with the sense organ. The usual manner of abridgement is to give the first (and sometimes the second) in a series complete, abridge the middle with the briefest possible indication of what belongs there and give the final item completely. Here, in concluding, Woodward has used 'objects' for his usual 'mind-states'. The Pali has 'dhamma'. I have followed his usual translation.</p>
