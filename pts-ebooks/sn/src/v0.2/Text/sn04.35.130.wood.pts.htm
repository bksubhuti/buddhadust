    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Kaccāna the Great was staying among the folk of Avanti, at Osprey's Haunt, on a sheer mountain crag.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the house-father Hāliddakāni came to see the venerable Kaccāna the Great,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him in friendly wise,<br/> and after the exchange of courtesies and greetings<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said this to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:-</p>

    <p class="f4">"It has been said by the Exalted One, sir,|| ||</p>

    <p class="fp4 in2">'Owing to diversity in elements<br/> arises diversity of contact.|| ||</p>

    <p class="fp4 in2">Owing to diversity of contact<br/> arises diversity of feeling."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, sir, how far is this so?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, house-father,<br/> seeing a pleasant object with the eye,<br/> a brother, at the thought</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is such and such,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">comes to know of eye-consciousness<br/> that is pleasant to experience.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to contact that is pleasant to experience<br/> arises pleasant feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">When with the eye<br/> he sees an object that is displeasing,<br/> a brother, at the thought</p>
