    <p><span class="f2">[121]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Udāyin<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> was staying at Kāmaṇḍāya,<br/> in the mango grove of the brahmin Todeyya.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a young fellow,<br/> a resident pupil of the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br/> came to visit the venerable Udāyin,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br/> the venerable Udāyin taught,<br/> established,<br/> roused,<br/> and made that lad happy with a pious talk.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he, being thus taught,<br/> established,<br/> roused<br/> and made happy<br/> by the pious talk of the venerable Udāyin,<br/> went to the <span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span> brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br/> and on coming to her said thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I would have my lady know<br/> that Udāyin, the recluse, is teaching a doctrine<br/> that is lovely in its beginning,<br/> lovely in its middle,<br/> and lovely in its ending.</p>

    <p class="f4">He sets forth the righteous life,<br/> fully perfected and purified,<br/> both in its spirit and in its form."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, my lad,<br/> in my name do you invite Udāyin, the recluse,<br/> for to-morrow's meal."</p>

    <p class="f4">"So be it, lady," replied the lad,<br/> and in obedience to the lady's bidding<br/> went back to the venerable Udāyin and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let the worthy Udāyin accept a teacher's fee from us,<br/> to-morrow's food from the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan."</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Udāyin accepted by his silence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Udāyin,<br/> when that night was past,<br/> robed himself at early dawn,<br/> and taking bowl and robe<br/> went to the dwelling<br/> of the brahmin lady of the Vetahaccani clan,<br/> and sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahmin lady served the venerable Udāyin<br/> with choice food,<br/> both hard and soft,<br/> with her own hands,<br/> until he had eaten his fill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now when she saw<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> that the venerable Udāyin had finished<br/> and withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br/> she put on her sandals,<br/> sat down on a high seat,<br/> veiling her head,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> and thus addressed the venerable Udāyin:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Preach me doctrine, O recluse."</p>

    <p class="f4">"A time will come for that, sister," said he,<br/> rose from his seat and went away.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a second time<br/> that young fellow visited the venerable Udāyin,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br/> the venerable Udāyin taught,<br/> established,<br/> roused,<br/> and made that lad happy with a pious talk.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a second time he, being thus taught,<br/> established,<br/> roused<br/> and made happy<br/> by the pious talk of the venerable Udāyin,<br/> went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[79]</b></span> and on coming to her said thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I would have my lady know<br/> that Udāyin, the recluse, is teaching a doctrine<br/> that is lovely in its beginning,<br/> lovely in its middle,<br/> and lovely in its ending.</p>

    <p class="f4">He sets forth the righteous life,<br/> fully perfected and purified,<br/> both in its spirit and in its form."</p>

    <p class="f4">"You are speaking thus, my lad,<br/> in praise of the recluse Udāyin.</p>

    <p class="f4">But (on the former occasion) when I said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Preach me doctrine, O recluse,' he replied:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A time will come for that, sister,'<br/> rose from his seat and went to his lodging."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, my lady,<br/> you put on your sandals,<br/> sat down on a high seat,<br/> veiled your head<br/> and spoke thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Preach me doctrine, O recluse.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now they honour the doctrine,<br/> those worthy ones.</p>

    <p class="f4">They respect the doctrine."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very well then, my lad.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you invite Udāyin, the recluse,<br/> in my name<br/> for to-morrow's meal."</p>

    <p class="f4">"So be it, my lady," replied the lad<br/> and in obedience to the lady's bidding<br/> went back to the venerable Udāyin and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let the worthy Udāyin accept a teacher's fee from us,<br/> to-morrow's food from the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan."</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Udāyin accepted by his silence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Udāyin,<br/> when that night was past,<br/> robed himself at early dawn,<br/> and taking bowl and robe<br/> went to the dwelling<br/> of the brahmin lady of the Vetahaccani clan,<br/> and sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahmin lady served the venerable Udāyin<br/> with choice food,<br/> both hard and soft,<br/> with her own hands,<br/> until he had eaten his fill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br/> when she saw that the venerable Udāyin had finished<br/> and removed his hand from the bowl,<br/> put off her sandals,<br/> sat down on a low seat,<br/> unveiled her head<br/> and thus addressed the venerable Udāyin: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir,<br/> owing to the existence of what<br/> do the Arahants point out weal and woe?</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the existence of what<br/> do they not do so?</p>

    <p class="f4">"When there is eye, sister,<br/> the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">When eye exists not, sister,<br/> the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"When there is ear, sister,<br/> the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">When ear exists not, sister,<br/> the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"When there is tongue, sister,<br/> the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">When tongue exists not, sister,<br/> the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"When there is body, sister,<br/> the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">When body exists not, sister,<br/> the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"When there is mind, sister,<br/> the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">When mind exists not, sister,<br/> the Arahants do not point out weal and woe."</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words the Brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan<br/> said to the venerable Udāyin: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Excellent, sir!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent, sir!</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br/> or shows forth what is hidden,<br/> or points out the way<br/> to him that wanders astray,<br/> or holds up a light in the darkness<br/> so that he who has eyes may see objects, -<br/> even so in divers ways<br/> has the Norm been set forth by the worthy Udāyin.</p>

    <p class="f4">I myself, master Udāyin,<br/> do go for refuge to that Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let the worthy Udāyin<br/> regard me as a lay-disciple who,<br/> from this day forth<br/> so long as life shall last,<br/> has so taken refuge."</p>
