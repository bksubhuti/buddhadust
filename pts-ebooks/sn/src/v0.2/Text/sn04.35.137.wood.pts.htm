    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is not of you, Brethren, put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is not of you?</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye, Brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear, Brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose, Brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue, Brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The body, Brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind, Brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if, Brethren, a man should gather,<br/> burn<br/> or do what he likes<br/> with all the grass,<br/> all the sticks,<br/> branches<br/> and stalks in this Jeta Grove,<br/> pray would he say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This man is gathering,<br/> is burning us,<br/> doing what he pleases with us'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why not?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Because, lord, this is not our self,<br/> nor of the nature of self."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, the eye is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear, Brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The body, Brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind, Brethren, is not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> This sutta does not have a nidana and in context should be located at Devadaha, but in the simile the Buddha speaks of 'this Jeta Grove'. This could be just an error due to the fact that the sutta is otherwise identical to SN 4.35.101, and someone overlooked the need to change the location of the grove being spoken of or the way the Jeta Grove was being spoken of.</p>
