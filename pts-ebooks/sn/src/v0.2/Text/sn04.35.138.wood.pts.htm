    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is not of you, Brethren, put it away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is not of you?</p>

    <p class="f4">Objects, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Sounds, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Scents, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Savours, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Tangibles, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Mind-objects, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if, Brethren, a man should gather,<br/> burn<br/> or do what he likes<br/> with all the grass,<br/> all the sticks,<br/> branches<br/> and stalks in this Jeta Grove,<br/> pray would he say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This man is gathering,<br/> is burning us,<br/> doing what he pleases with us'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why not?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Because, lord, this is not our self,<br/> nor of the nature of self."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, objects are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Sounds, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Mind-states, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>
