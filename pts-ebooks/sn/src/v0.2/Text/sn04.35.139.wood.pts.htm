    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakkas at Devadaha,<br/> a township of the Sakkas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The eye, Brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the eye,<br/> that also is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to impermanence<br/> the eye has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the eye be permanent?|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The ear, Brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the ear,<br/> that also is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to impermanence<br/> the ear has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the ear be permanent?|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The nose, Brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the nose,<br/> that also is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to impermanence<br/> the nose has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the nose be permanent?|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The tongue, Brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the tongue,<br/> that also is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to impermanence<br/> the tongue has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the tongue be permanent?|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The body, Brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the body,<br/> that also is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to impermanence<br/> the body has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the body be permanent?|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The mind, Brethren, is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the mind,<br/> that also is impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to impermanence<br/> the mind has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the mind be permanent?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled by these,<br/> he lusts not for them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not lusting he is set free.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this freedom<br/> comes insight<br/> that it is a being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task.</p>

    <p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>
