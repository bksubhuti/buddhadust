    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakkas at Devadaha,<br/> a township of the Sakkas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The eye, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the eye,<br/> that also is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/> the eye has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the eye be pleasant?|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The ear, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the ear,<br/> that also is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/> the ear has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the ear be pleasant?|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The nose, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the nose,<br/> that also is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/> the nose has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the nose be pleasant?|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The tongue, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the tongue,<br/> that also is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/> the tongue has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the tongue be pleasant?|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The body, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the body,<br/> that also is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/> the body has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the body be pleasant?|| ||</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"The mind, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of the mind,<br/> that also is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/> the mind has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could the mind be pleasant?|| ||</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the eye,<br/> is repelled by objects,<br/> is repelled by eye-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by eye-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to eye-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the ear,<br/> is repelled by sounds,<br/> is repelled by ear-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by ear-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to ear-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the body,<br/> is repelled by things tactile,<br/> is repelled by body-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by body-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to body-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the mind,<br/> is repelled by mind-states,<br/> is repelled by mind-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by mind-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to mind-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled by these,<br/> he lusts not for them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not lusting he is set free.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this freedom<br/> comes insight<br/> that it is a being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task.</p>

    <p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>
