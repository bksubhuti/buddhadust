    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakkas at Devadaha,<br/> a township of the Sakkas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Objects, Brethren, are suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of objects,<br/> that also is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/> objects have come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">"Mind-states, Brethren, are suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/> whatever cause there be<br/> for the appearance of mind-states,<br/> that also is suffering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/> mind-states have come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">How could mind-states be pleasant?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> is repelled by the eye,<br/> is repelled by objects,<br/> is repelled by eye-consciousness,<br/> is repelled by eye-contact,<br/> is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/> which arises owing to eye-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Being repelled by these,<br/> he lusts not for them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not lusting he is set free.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this freedom<br/> comes insight<br/> that it is a being free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task.</p>

    <p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'"</p>
