    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, Brethren, action<br/> both new and old,<br/> the ceasing of action<br/> and the way leading to the ceasing of action.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Apply your minds and I will speak.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is action that is old?</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye, Brethren, is to be viewed as action that is old,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> brought about<br/> and intentionally done,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> as a base for feeling.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear, Brethren, is to be viewed as action that is old,<br/> brought about<br/> and intentionally done,<br/> as a base for feeling.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose, Brethren, is to be viewed as action that is old,<br/> brought about<br/> and intentionally done,<br/> as a base for feeling.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue, Brethren, is to be viewed as action that is old,<br/> brought about<br/> and intentionally done,<br/> as a base for feeling.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The body, Brethren, is to be viewed as action that is old,<br/> brought about<br/> and intentionally done,<br/> as a base for feeling.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind, Brethren, is to be viewed as action that is old,<br/> brought about<br/> and intentionally done,<br/> as a base for feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is action that is new?</p>

    <p class="f4">The action one performs now, Brethren,<br/> by body,<br/> speech<br/> and mind, -<br/> that is called<br/> 'action that is new.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is<br/> the ceasing of action?</p>

    <p class="f4">That ceasing of action by body,<br/> speech<br/> and mind,<br/> by which one contacts freedom, -<br/> that is called<br/> 'the ceasing of action.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is<br/> the way leading to the ceasing of action?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right View,<br/> Right Intention,<br/> Right Speech,<br/> Right Doing,<br/> Right Living,<br/> Right Effort,<br/> Right Mindfulness,<br/> Right Concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Brethren, is called<br/> 'the way leading to the ceasing of action.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Brethren, have I taught you<br/> action that is old<br/> and action that is new.</p>

    <p class="f4">I have taught you<br/> the ceasing of action<br/> and the way leading to the ceasing of action.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever, Brethren, should be done by a teacher<br/> out of compassion,<br/> for the profit of his disciples,<br/> that have I done,<br/> taking pity on you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here are the roots of trees, brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here are lonely places to dwell in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be not remiss, brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be not regretful hereafter.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is our instruction to you.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
