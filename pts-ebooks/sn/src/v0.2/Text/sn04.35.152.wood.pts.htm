    <p><span class="f2">[138]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is there, Brethren, any method,<br/> by following which<br/> a brother, apart from belief,<br/> apart from inclination,<br/> apart from hearsay,<br/> apart from argument as to method,<br/> apart from reflection on reasons,<br/> apart from delight in speculation,<br/> could affirm insight, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Elided is birth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter?' "For us, lord, things have their root in the Exalted One,<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br/> if the meaning of this that has been spoken<br/> were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/> the brethren will remember it."</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is indeed a method, Brethren,<br/> by following which<br/> a brother, apart from belief,<br/> apart from inclination,<br/> apart from hearsay,<br/> apart from argument as to method,<br/> apart from reflection on reasons,<br/> apart from delight in speculation,<br/> could affirm insight,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Ended is birth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter?'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that method?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother,<br/> beholding an object with the eye,<br/> either recognizes within him the existence<br/> of lust, malice and illusion, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I have lust, malice and illusion,'</p>

    <p class="f4">or recognizes the non-existence of these qualities within him, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I have not lust, malice and illusion.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now as to that recognition<br/> of their existence or non-existence within him,<br/> are these conditions,<br/> I ask,<br/> to be understood by belief,<br/> or inclination,<br/> or hearsay,<br/> or argument as to method,<br/> or reflection on reasons,<br/> or delight in speculation?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Are not these states to be understood<br/> by seeing them with the eye of wisdom?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, Brethren,<br/> this is the method<br/> by following which,<br/> apart from belief,<br/> or inclination,<br/> or hearsay,<br/> or argument as to method,<br/> or reflection on reasons,<br/> or delight in speculation<br/> whereby a brother could affirm insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Ended is birth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, as to hearing a sound with the ear,<br/> either recognizes within him the existence<br/> of lust, malice and illusion, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I have lust, malice and illusion,'</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, as to tasting a savour with the tongue,<br/> either recognizes within him the existence<br/> of lust, malice and illusion, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, as to contacting a tangible with the body,<br/> either recognizes within him the existence<br/> of lust, malice and illusion, thus:</p>
