    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Perfect in faculty!</p>

    <p class="f4">Perfect in faculty!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is the saying, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">How far, lord,<br/> is one perfect in faculty?"</p>

    <p class="f4">If a brother, who dwells observing the rise and fall in the eye as faculty,<br/> is repelled by the eye as faculty . . . by the ear . . . by the nose . . . tongue . . . body, if he be repelled by the mind as faculty, - thus repelled he lusts not for it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the knowledge arises in him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Freed am I by freedom,'</p>

    <p class="f4">so that he realizes:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Rooted out is birth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far a brother is perfect in faculty.'</p>
