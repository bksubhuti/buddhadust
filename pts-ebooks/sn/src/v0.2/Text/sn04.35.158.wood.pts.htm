    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do ye apply your minds thoroughly, Brethren,<br/> to objects,<br/> and regard their true nature as impermanent.</p>

    <p class="f4">He who so applies his mind thoroughly to objects,<br/> and so regards them,<br/> feels repelled by objects.</p>

    <p class="f4">By the destruction of the lure of objects<br/> comes the destruction of the lure.</p>
