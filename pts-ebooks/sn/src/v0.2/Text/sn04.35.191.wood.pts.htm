    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable Koṭṭhika the Great were staying near Benares,<br/> at Isipatana in the Antelope Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Koṭṭhika the Great,<br/> rising from his solitude at eventide,<br/> went to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> he said to the venerable Sāriputta: —</p>

    <p class="f4">"How now, friend?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the eye the bond of objects,<br/> or are objects the bond of the eye?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the ear the bond of sounds,<br/> or are sounds the bond of the ear?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the nose the bond of scents,<br/> or are scents the bond of the nose?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the tongue the bond of savours,<br/> or are savours the bond of the tongue?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is the body the bond of tangibles,<br/> or are tangibles the bond of the body?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is mind the bond of mind-states,<br/> or are mind-states the bond of the mind?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, friend Koṭṭhika.</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye is not the bond of objects,<br/> nor are objects the bond of the eye,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear is not the bond of sounds,<br/> nor are sounds the bond of the ear,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose is not the bond of scents,<br/> nor are scents the bond of the nose,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue is not the bond of savours,<br/> nor are savours the bond of the tongue,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The body is not the bond of tangibles,<br/> nor are tangibles the bond of the body,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind is not the bond of mind-states,<br/> nor are mind-states the bond of the mind,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, friend,<br/> two oxen,<br/> one white and one black,<br/> tied by one rope<br/> or one yoke-tie.</p>

    <p class="f4">Would one be right in saying<br/> that the black ox is the bond for the white one,<br/> or that the white ox is the bond for the black one?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, friend.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is not so.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the rope<br/> or the yoke-tie <span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span> which binds the two, —<br/> that is the bond that unites them.</p>

    <p class="f4">So it is that the eye is not the bond of objects,<br/> nor are objects the bond of the eye,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear is not the bond of sounds,<br/> nor are sounds the bond of the ear,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose is not the bond of scents,<br/> nor are scents the bond of the nose,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue is not the bond of savours,<br/> nor are savours the bond of the tongue,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The body is not the bond of tangibles,<br/> nor are tangibles the bond of the body,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind is not the bond of mind-states,<br/> nor are mind-states the bond of the mind,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">If the eye, friend,<br/> were the bond of objects,<br/> or if objects were the bond of the eye,<br/> then this righteous life<br/> for the utter destruction of Ill<br/> could not be proclaimed.</p>

    <p class="f4">But since the eye, friend,<br/> is not the bond of objects,<br/> nor are objects the bond of the eye,<br/> but the desire and lust<br/> which are in them<br/> is the bond,<br/> therefore is the righteous life<br/> for the utter destruction of Ill<br/> proclaimed.</p>

    <p class="f4">If the tongue, friend,<br/> were the bond of savours,<br/> or if savours were the bond of the tongue,<br/> then this righteous life<br/> for the utter destruction of Ill<br/> could not be proclaimed.</p>

    <p class="f4">But since the tongue, friend,<br/> is not the bond of savours,<br/> nor are savours the bond of the tongue,<br/> but the desire and lust<br/> which are in them<br/> is the bond,<br/> therefore is the righteous life<br/> for the utter destruction of Ill<br/> proclaimed.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">If the body, friend,<br/> were the bond of tangibles,<br/> or if tangibles were the bond of the body,<br/> then this righteous life<br/> for the utter destruction of Ill<br/> could not be proclaimed.</p>

    <p class="f4">But since the body, friend,<br/> is not the bond of tangibles,<br/> nor are tangibles the bond of the body,<br/> but the desire and lust<br/> which are in them<br/> is the bond,<br/> therefore is the righteous life<br/> for the utter destruction of Ill<br/> proclaimed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now by this method<br/> it is to be understood,<br/> as I have stated:</p>

    <p class="f4">That the eye is not the bond of objects,<br/> nor are objects the bond of the eye,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear is not the bond of sounds,<br/> nor are sounds the bond of the ear,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is in the Exalted One an eye, friend.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One sees an object with the eye.</p>

    <p class="f4">But in the Exalted One is no desire and lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wholly heart-free is the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">There is in the Exalted One an ear, friend.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wholly heart-free is the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">There is in the Exalted One a nose, friend.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wholly heart-free is the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">There is in the Exalted One a body, friend.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One contacts tangibles with the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wholly heart-free is the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">There is in the Exalted One a mind, friend.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One cognizes mind-states with the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">But in the Exalted One is no desire and lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wholly heart-free is the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">By this method, friend, you are to understand, as I said before:</p>

    <p class="f4">That the eye is not the bond of objects,<br/> nor are objects the bond of the eye,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The body is not the bond of tangibles,<br/> nor are tangibles the bond of the body,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind is not the bond of mind-states,<br/> nor are mind-states the bond of the mind,<br/> but that desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to these two,<br/> that is the bond.</p>
