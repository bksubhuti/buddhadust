    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Udāyin were staying at Kosambī in Ghosita Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Udāyin, rising at eventide from his solitude, went to visit the venerable Ānanda, and on coming to him greeted him courteously, and after the <span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span> exchange of greetings and courtesies sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the venerable Udāyin said to the venerable Ānanda: —</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is it possible, friend <span class="mozp">Ānanda</span>, just as this body has in divers ways been defined, explained, set forth by the Exalted One, as being without the self, — is it possible in the same way to describe the consciousness, to show it, make it plain, set it forth, make it clear, analyse and expound it as being also without the self?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Just as this body has been defined, explained, set forth by the Exalted One, friend Udāyin, so also is it possible to describe this consciousness, to show it, make it plain, set it forth, make it clear, analyse and expound it as being also without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the eye and object arises eye-consciousness, does it not, friend?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, if the condition, if the cause of the arising of eye-consciousness should altogether, in every way, utterly come to cease without remainder, would any eye-consciousness be evident?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely not, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, friend, it is by this method that the Exalted One has explained, opened up, and shown that this consciousness also is without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, owing to ear and sounds, friend, arises ear-consciousness, does it not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It does, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, if the condition, if the cause of the arising of ear-consciousness should cease altogether, in every way, utterly, without remainder, would any ear-consciousness be evident?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely not, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, it is by this method that the Exalted One has explained, opened up, and shown that this consciousness also is without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, owing to nose and scents, friend, arises nose-consciousness, does it not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It does, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, if the condition, if the cause of the arising of nose-consciousness should cease altogether, in every way, utterly, without remainder, would any nose-consciousness be evident?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely not, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, it is by this method that the Exalted One has explained, opened up, and shown that this consciousness also is without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, owing to tongue and savours, friend, arises tongue-consciousness, does it not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It does, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, if the condition, if the cause of the arising of tongue-consciousness should cease altogether, in every way, utterly, without remainder, would any tongue-consciousness be evident?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely not, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, it is by this method that the Exalted One has explained, opened up, and shown that this consciousness also is without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, owing to body and things tangible, friend, arises body-consciousness, does it not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'It does, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, if the condition, if the cause of the arising of body-consciousness should cease altogether, in every way, utterly, without remainder, would any body-consciousness be evident?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely not, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, it is by this method that the Exalted One has explained, opened up, and shown that this consciousness also is without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, owing to mind and mind-states arises mind-consciousness, does it not?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, if the condition, if the cause for the arising of mind- <span class="f2 g"><b>[104]</b></span> consciousness should cease altogether, in every way, utterly, without remainder, would any mind-consciousness be evident?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely not, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, it is by this method that the Exalted One has explained, opened up, and shown that this consciousness also is without the self.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, friend, that a man should roam about in need of heart of wood,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> searching for heart of wood, looking for heart of wood, and, taking a sharp axe, should enter a forest. There he sees a mighty plantain-trunk, straight up, new-grown, of towering height. He cuts it down at the root. Having cut it down at the root he chops it off at the top. Having done so he peels off the outer skin. But he would find no pith inside. Much less would he find heart of wood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, friend, a brother beholds no trace of the self nor of what pertains to the self in the sixfold sense-sphere.</p>

    <p class="f4">So beholding, he is attached to nothing in the world. Unattached, he is not troubled. Untroubled, he is of himself utterly set free.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> So that he realizes, "Destroyed is rebirth. Lived is the righteous life. Done is the task. For life in these conditions there is no hereafter.'</p>
