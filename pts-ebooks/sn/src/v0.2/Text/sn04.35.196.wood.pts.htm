    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Where there is a hand, Brethren,<br/> there are seen<br/> taking up and putting down.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where there is a foot,<br/> there are seen,<br/> coming and going.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where is a limb,<br/> there are seen<br/> bending in and stretching out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where there is belly,<br/> there hunger and thirst are seen.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, Brethren, where is eye,<br/> there arises<br/> owing to eye-contact<br/> one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where is ear,<br/> there arises<br/> owing to ear-contact<br/> one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where is nose,<br/> there arises<br/> owing to nose-contact<br/> one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where is tongue,<br/> there arises<br/> owing to tongue-contact<br/> one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where is body,<br/> there arises<br/> owing to body-contact<br/> one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where is mind,<br/> there arises<br/> owing to mind-contact<br/> one's personal weal and woe.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Where the hand is not,<br/> no taking up or laying down is seen.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, Brethren, where eye is not,<br/> no personal weal or woe arises<br/> owing to eye-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where is ear is not,<br/> no personal weal or woe arises<br/> owing to ear-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">Where nose is not,<br/> no personal weal or woe arises<br/> owing to nose-contact.</p>
