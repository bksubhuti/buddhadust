    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Proficient in three ways, Brethren,<br/> a brother dwells to the full<br/> with ease and pleasure in this very life,<br/> and he has strong grounds<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">In what three things?</p>

    <p class="f4">He keeps guard on the door of the faculties,<br/> he is moderate in eating,<br/> he is given to watchfulness.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, does a brother<br/> keep guard on the door of the faculties?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a brother,<br/> seeing an object with the eye,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> is not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of eye uncontrolled,<br/> he applies himself to such control,<br/> sets a guard over the faculty of eye,<br/> attains control thereof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When he hears a sound with the ear,<br/> he is not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of ear uncontrolled,<br/> he applies himself to such control,<br/> sets a guard over the faculty of ear,<br/> attains control thereof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When with the nose he smells a scent,<br/> he is not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of nose uncontrolled,<br/> he applies himself to such control,<br/> sets a guard over the faculty of nose,<br/> attains control thereof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When with the tongue he tastes a savour,<br/> he is not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of tongue uncontrolled,<br/> he applies himself to such control,<br/> sets a guard over the faculty of tongue,<br/> attains control thereof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When with body he contacts tangibles,<br/> he is not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of body uncontrolled,<br/> he applies himself to such control,<br/> sets a guard over the faculty of body,<br/> attains control thereof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When with mind he cognizes a mind-state,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span> he is not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of ear uncontrolled,<br/> he applies himself to such control,<br/> sets a guard over the faculty of ear,<br/> attains control thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, on level ground<br/> at the crossing of the four highways<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> a car be drawn by thoroughbreds,<br/> with a goad set in rest therein,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> and a clever trainer,<br/> a driver who tames steeds.</p>

    <p class="f4">He mounts thereon,<br/> with his left hand holding the reins,<br/> and in his right he takes the goad,<br/> and drives the car forward and backward,<br/> whither and how he wills.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, Brethren, a brother practises the guard over the six faculties,<br/> he practises for their restraint,<br/> for their taming,<br/> for their calming.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Brethren, is how a brother keeps a guard over the faculties.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother moderate in eating?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother takes his food<br/> thoughtfully and prudently,<br/> not for sport,<br/> not for indulgence,<br/> not for personal charm and adornment,<br/> but sufficient for the support<br/> and upkeep of body,<br/> to allay its pains,<br/> to help the practice of the righteous life,<br/> with the thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My former feeling I check<br/> and set on foot<br/> no new feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">So shall I keep going,<br/> be blameless<br/> and live at ease.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as a man, Brethren, anoints a wound<br/> just for the healing of it,<br/> or just as he oils an axle<br/> enough for carrying the load,<br/> even so<br/> thoughtfully and prudently<br/> does a brother take his food,<br/> not for sport,<br/> not for indulgence,<br/> not for personal charm and adornment,<br/> but sufficient for the support<br/> and upkeep of body,<br/> to allay its pains,<br/> to help the practice of the righteous life,<br/> with the thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My former feeling I check<br/> and set on foot<br/> no new feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">So shall I keep going,<br/> be blameless<br/> and live at ease.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Brethren, is how a brother is moderate in eating.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother given to watchfulness?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, by day<br/> a brother walks up and down and sits,<br/> and so cleanses his heart<br/> from states that may hinder.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">By night, for the first watch,<br/> a brother walks up and down and sits,<br/> and so cleanses his heart<br/> from states that may hinder.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night,<br/> lying on his right side,<br/> he takes up the posture of a lion,<br/> resting one foot on the other,<br/> and thus collected and composed<br/> fixes his thought on rising up again.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the last watch of the night,<br/> at early dawn,<br/> he walks up and <span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span> down and sits,<br/> and so cleanses his heart<br/> from states that may hinder.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Brethren, is a brother given to watchfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">So, Brethren, possessed of these three things,<br/> a brother dwells to the full<br/> with ease and pleasure in this very life,<br/> and so has strong grounds<br/> for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>
