    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Formerly, Brethren, a tortoise,<br/> a shell-back,<br/> was questing for its prey<br/> at eventide<br/> along a river bank.</p>

    <p class="f4">A jackal also, Brethren,<br/> was questing for its prey<br/> at eventide<br/> along that river bank.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Brethren, that tortoise,<br/> that shell-back<br/> saw from afar<br/> that jackal<br/> questing for its prey.</p>

    <p class="f4">So drawing its neck and four limbs<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> into its shell<br/> it crouched down at leisure<br/> and kept still.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the jackal,<br/> seeing that tortoise,<br/> the shell-back,<br/> from afar,<br/> came up to it,<br/> and on reaching it<br/> kept watching it<br/> with the thought:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'As soon as the tortoise,<br/> the shell-back,<br/> puts out one or other of its five limbs,<br/> I'll seize it,<br/> crack and eat it.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, Brethren, as the tortoise,<br/> the shell-back,<br/> did not put out one or other of its five limbs,<br/> the jackal was disgusted with the tortoise<br/> and went away,<br/> not having got a chance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, <i>Māra</i>,<br/> the Evil One,<br/> is for ever on the watch<br/> unceasingly,<br/> with the thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Maybe I shall get a chance<br/> to catch one of these,<br/> by way of eye<br/> by way of the ear,<br/> by way of the nose,<br/> by way of the tongue,<br/> by way of the body,<br/> by way of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, Brethren, do ye abide keeping watch over the doors of the faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seeing an object with the eye,<br/> be not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of eye uncontrolled,<br/> do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br/> set a guard over the faculty of eye,<br/> attain control thereof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the ear,<br/> be not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of ear uncontrolled,<br/> do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br/> set a guard over the faculty of ear,<br/> attain control thereof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When with the nose smelling a scent,<br/> be is not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of nose uncontrolled,<br/> do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br/> set a guard over the faculty of nose,<br/> attain control thereof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When with the tongue tasting a savour,<br/> be is not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of tongue uncontrolled,<br/> do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br/> set a guard over the faculty of tongue,<br/> attain control thereof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When with body contacting tangibles,<br/> be is not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of body uncontrolled,<br/> do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br/> set a guard over the faculty of body,<br/> attain control thereof.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When with mind he cognizing a mind-state,<br/> be is not misled by its outer view<br/> nor by its lesser details.</p>

    <p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> might overwhelm one<br/> who dwells with the faculty of ear uncontrolled,<br/> do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br/> set a guard over the faculty of ear,<br/> attain control thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">So long, Brethren, as ye abide<br/> keeping watch over the doors of the faculties,<br/> <i>Māra</i>, the Evil One, will go away in disgust,<br/> not getting a chance,<br/> as the jackal did not get a chance<br/> from the tortoise.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[113]</b></span> E'en as the tortoise in its own shell's shelter<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> Withdraws its limbs, so may the brother holding,<br/> Composed, intent, thoughts in his mind arisen,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> Leaning on naught,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> injuring ne'er his neighbour,<br/> From evil freed wholly,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> speak ill of no man.</p>
