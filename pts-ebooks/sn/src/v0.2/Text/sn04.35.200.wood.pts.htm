    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī,<br/> on the bank of the river Ganges.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One saw a great log<br/> being carried down Ganges' stream,<br/> and on seeing it<br/> he called to the Brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, do ye see yonder great log<br/> being carried down Granges' stream?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, Brethren, if the log does not ground<br/> on this bank<br/> or the further bank,<br/> does not sink in mid-stream,<br/> does not stick fast on a shoal,<br/> does not fall into human or non-human bands,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> is not caught in a whirlpool,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> does not rot inwardly, -<br/> that log, Brethren,<br/> will float down to ocean,<br/> will slide down to ocean,<br/> will tend towards ocean.</p>

    <p class="f4">And why?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, Brethren, Ganges' stream<br/> floats down to ocean,<br/> slides down to ocean,<br/> tends towards ocean.</p>

    <p class="f4">In like manner, Brethren,<br/> if ye do not ground<br/> on this shore<br/> or that shore,<br/> if ye sink not in mid-stream,<br/> if ye stick not fast on a shoal,<br/> if ye fall not into hands human or non-human,<br/> if ye be not caught in a whirlpool,<br/> if ye rot not inwardly, -<br/> then, Brethren,<br/> ye shall float down to Nibbāna<br/> ye shall slide <span class="f2 g"><b>[114]</b></span> down to Nibbāna,<br/> ye shall tend towards Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">And why?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, Brethren, perfect view<br/> floats towards Nibbāna,<br/> slides towards Nibbāna,<br/> tends towards Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words<br/> a certain brother said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"What, lord, is 'this bank'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'the other bank'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'sinking in mid-stream'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'sticking fast on a shoal'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'falling into hands human or non human'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'being caught in a whirlpool'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'rotting inwardly'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"'This bank,' brother,<br/> is a name for the sixfold personal sense-sphere.</p>

    <p class="f4">'That bank,' brother,<br/> is a name for the external sixfold sense-sphere.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sinking in mid-stream,' brother,<br/> is a name for the lure and lust.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brother, is 'being caught by humans'?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this matter, brother,<br/> a householder lives in society,<br/> rejoices with them that rejoice,<br/> sorrows with them that sorrow,<br/> takes pleasure with them that take pleasure,<br/> suffers with them that suffer,<br/> makes a link with<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> all manner of business that befalls.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brother, is<br/> 'being caught by humans.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brother, is 'being caught by non-humans'?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this matter, brother,<br/> such and such an one lives the righteous life<br/> with the wish to be reborn in the company of some class of devas,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> with the thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'May I,<br/> by virtue<br/> or practice<br/> or by some austerity<br/> or by righteous living,<br/> become a deva<br/> or one of the devas.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brother, is<br/> 'being caught by non-humans.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Being caught in a whirlpool,' brother,<br/> is a name for the pleasure of the five senses.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brother, is 'rotting inwardly'?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brother, a certain one is immoral,<br/> an evil-doer,<br/> impure,<br/> of suspicious behaviour,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> of covert deeds.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is no recluse,<br/> though a recluse in vows:<br/> no liver of the righteous life,<br/> though vowed thereto:<br/> rotten within<br/> and full of lusts,<br/> a rubbish-heap of filth<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> is he.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is 'rotting inwardly.'"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[115]</b></span> Now on that occasion<br/> Nanda the cowherd was standing<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Nanda the cowherd<br/> exclaimed to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, lord, am one<br/> who is not grounded<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> on this bank.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not stranded<br/> on the further bank.</p>

    <p class="f4">I shall not sink in mid-stream.</p>

    <p class="f4">I shall not run aground on a shallow.</p>

    <p class="f4">I shall not be caught by humans<br/> or non-humans.</p>

    <p class="f4">No whirlpool shall catch me.</p>

    <p class="f4">I shall not rot inwardly.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lord, may I get ordination<br/> at the Exalted One's hands?</p>

    <p class="f4">May I get full ordination?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, Nanda, do you restore the kine<br/> to their owners."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, the kine will go back.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are longing for their calves."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you just restore the kine<br/> to their owners, Nanda."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Nanda the cowherd,<br/> having restored the kine to their owners,<br/> came to the Exalted One and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, the kine are restored to their owners.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lord, may I get ordination<br/> at the Exalted One's hands?</p>

    <p class="f4">May I get full ordination?"</p>

    <p class="f4">So Nanda the cowherd gained ordination,<br/> gained full ordination<br/> at the Exalted One's hands.</p>

    <p class="f4">And not long after,<br/> the venerable Nanda,<br/> living solitary and remote,<br/> ardent and intent,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/> in no long time attained that goal<br/> for which the clansmen rightly leave home<br/> for the homeless life,<br/> even that unrivalled goal of righteous living:<br/> attained it even in that very life,<br/> and knowing it for himself,<br/> realizing it for himself,<br/> abode therein,<br/> so that he came to know:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task.</p>

    <p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Nanda<br/> was yet another of the Arahants.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> For Kosambī see Appendix.</p>

    <p class="lgqt">[Ed. The Appendix Reads:</p>

    <p class="lgqt">N. to p. 113: "At Kosambī, on the bank of the river Ganges." Dr. E. J. Thomas, in his recently published book, <i>The Life of Buddha,</i> p. 15, doubts, with Cunningham and Vincent Smith, whether Kosambī was on the Ganges; and refers to the present passage, text p. 179, and S. iii, 140 ( = K.S. iii, 118, where I wrongly printed "Ayojjhāya") as the two places in the Canon where Ayojjhā is so situated. Our text has a variant reading Ayojjhāyaṅ in three MSS.]</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> suggests that a man seeing the log would row out and land it, to make a roof-beam of it, or, if it were of sandal-wood, he would set it up to make the door of a shrine. Thus 'non-humans' would have it.</p>
