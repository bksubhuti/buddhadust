    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Kimbilā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> on the bank of the river Ganges.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One saw a great log<br/> being carried down Ganges' stream,<br/> and on seeing it<br/> he called to the Brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, do ye see yonder great log<br/> being carried down Granges' stream?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, Brethren, if the log does not ground<br/> on this bank<br/> or the further bank,<br/> does not sink in mid-stream,<br/> does not stick fast on a shoal,<br/> does not fall into human or non-human bands,<br/> is not caught in a whirlpool,<br/> does not rot inwardly, -<br/> that log, Brethren,<br/> will float down to ocean,<br/> will slide down to ocean,<br/> will tend towards ocean.</p>

    <p class="f4">And why?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, Brethren, Ganges' stream<br/> floats down to ocean,<br/> slides down to ocean,<br/> tends towards ocean.</p>

    <p class="f4">In like manner, Brethren,<br/> if ye do not ground<br/> on this shore<br/> or that shore,<br/> if ye sink not in mid-stream,<br/> if ye stick not fast on a shoal,<br/> if ye fall not into hands human or non-human,<br/> if ye be not caught in a whirlpool,<br/> if ye rot not inwardly, -<br/> then, Brethren,<br/> ye shall float down to Nibbāna<br/> ye shall slide down to Nibbāna,<br/> ye shall tend towards Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, Brethren, perfect view<br/> floats towards Nibbāna,<br/> slides towards Nibbāna,<br/> tends towards Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[116]</b></span> At these words<br/> the venerable Kimbila said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"What, lord, is 'this bank'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'the other bank'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'sinking in mid-stream'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'sticking fast on a shoal'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'falling into hands human or non human'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'being caught in a whirlpool'?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is 'rotting inwardly'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"'This bank,' Kimbila,<br/> is a name for the sixfold personal sense-sphere.</p>

    <p class="f4">'That bank,' Kimbila,<br/> is a name for the external sixfold sense-sphere.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sinking in mid-stream,' Kimbila,<br/> is a name for the lure and lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Kimbila, is 'being caught by humans'?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this matter, brother,<br/> a householder lives in society,<br/> rejoices with them that rejoice,<br/> sorrows with them that sorrow,<br/> takes pleasure with them that take pleasure,<br/> suffers with them that suffer,<br/> makes a link with<br/> all manner of business that befalls.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Kimbila, is<br/> 'being caught by humans.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Kimbila, is 'being caught by non-humans'?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this matter, Kimbila,<br/> such and such an one lives the righteous life<br/> with the wish to be reborn in the company of some class of devas,<br/> with the thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'May I,<br/> by virtue<br/> or practice<br/> or by some austerity<br/> or by righteous living,<br/> become a deva<br/> or one of the devas.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Kimbila, is<br/> 'being caught by non-humans.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Being caught in a whirlpool,' Kimbila,<br/> is a name for the pleasure of the five senses.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brother, is 'rotting inwardly'?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Kimbila, a brother is guilty of some foul offence, of such a nature that no pardon thereof is declared<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is 'rotting inwardly.'"</p>
