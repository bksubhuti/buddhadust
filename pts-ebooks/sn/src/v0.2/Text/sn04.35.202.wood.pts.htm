    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> near Kapilavatthu,<br/> in the Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time there was a newly built mote-hall<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu,<br/> not long made,<br/> never yet dwelt in<br/> by recluse<br/> or brahmin<br/> or any other human being.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br/> came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> they saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> they said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Here, lord, is a newly built mote-hall<br/> of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu,<br/> not long made,<br/> never yet dwelt in<br/> by recluse<br/> or brahmin<br/> or any other human being.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let our lord, the Exalted One,<br/> be the first to make use of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">When the Exalted One has first made use of it,<br/> afterwards the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu will use it.</p>

    <p class="f4">That shall be for the profit and welfare<br/> of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br/> for many a long day."</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One assented by silence.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu,<br/> seeing the consent of the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him by the right<br/> and went away to the <span class="f2 g"><b>[117]</b></span> new mote-hall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having got it ready in every way,<br/> having appointed seats,<br/> set a water-pot<br/> and hung up an oil-lamp,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> they went to the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him they said: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"All ready, lord, is the mote-hall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seats are appointed.</p>

    <p class="f4">A water-pot is set.</p>

    <p class="f4">An oil-lamp is hung.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let the Exalted One now do what seems good to him."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One robed himself,<br/> and taking outer robe and bowl<br/> went along with a great company of brethren<br/> to the new mote-hall.</p>

    <p class="f4">On reaching it<br/> he had his feet washed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> entered the mote-hall<br/> and sat down against the middle pillar,<br/> facing the east.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Order of Brethren also had their feet washed,<br/> entered the mote-hall<br/> and sat down against the western wall,<br/> also facing east,<br/> with the Exalted One in front of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also,<br/> having had their feet washed,<br/> entered the mote-hall<br/> and sat down against the eastern wall,<br/> having the Exalted One in front of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One taught the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br/> with a pious talk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> till far into the night,<br/> established them,<br/> roused<br/> and made them happy.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he dismissed them with these words:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The night is far spent, Gotamas.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye now what seems good to you."</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is well, lord,"<br/> said the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br/> in obedience to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And they rose up,<br/> saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br/> the Exalted One said to the venerable Moggallāna the Great: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Moggallāna, the Order of Brethren<br/> is now freed of sloth <span class="f2 g"><b>[118]</b></span> and torpor.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Bethink thee, Moggallāna,<br/> of a pious talk to the Order of Brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">My back is aching.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will stretch it.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very well, lord," replied the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One had his robe folded into four<br/> and lay down on his right side<br/> in the lion-posture,<br/> putting one foot on the other,<br/> collected and composed,<br/> with his mind set on rising up again.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Moggallāna the Great addressed the Brethren,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, friend," replied those brethren<br/> to the venerable Moggallāna the Great.</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Moggallāna the Great then said: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, I will teach you the way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> of lusting<br/> and also of not lusting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye apply your minds carefully<br/> and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very good, friend,"<br/> replied those brethren to the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/> who then said: -</p>
