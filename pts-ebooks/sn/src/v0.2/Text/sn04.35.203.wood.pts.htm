    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren, when a brother knows,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising<br/> and the destruction<br/> of all states of ill,<br/> then indeed sensual pleasures are seen by him.</p>

    <p class="f4">When he sees sensual pleasures,<br/> that desire for sensual pleasures,<br/> that love of sensual pleasures,<br/> that infatuation,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> that feverish longing<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> for sensual pleasures,<br/> which is therein,<br/> does not fasten on him.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">His path abroad<br/> and his lodging at home<br/> are so practised<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> that,<br/> in such a way of life,<br/> coveting and dejection,<br/> those evil,<br/> unprofitable states,<br/> do not fasten on him.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, does a brother know,<br/> as they really are,<br/> both the arising<br/> and the destruction<br/> of all states of ill?</p>

    <p class="f4">He knows</p>

    <p class="f4">'Such is body,<br/> such the arising of body,<br/> such is the destruction of body;</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is feeling,<br/> such the arising of feeling,<br/> such is the destruction of feeling;</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is perception,<br/> such the arising of perception,<br/> such is the destruction of perception;</p>

    <p class="f4">Such are the activities,<br/> such the arising of the activities,<br/> such is the destruction of the activities;</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is consciousness,<br/> such the arising of the consciousness,<br/> such is the destruction of the consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Brethren, is how he knows,<br/> as they really are,<br/> both the arising<br/> and the destruction<br/> of all states of ill.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, are sensual pleasures<br/> seen by a brother,<br/> in such a way that,<br/> so seeing sensual pleasures,<br/> that love of sensual pleasures<br/> that is therein<br/> does not fasten on him?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, there were a pit of charcoal,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> deeper than a man's height,<br/> full of charcoal,<br/> without flame<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> and smokeless.</p>

    <p class="f4">And suppose a man should come,<br/> fond of life,<br/> not loving death,<br/> but loathing pain.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then two strong men lay hold of him,<br/> one by each arm,<br/> and drag him to the pit of charcoal.</p>

    <p class="f4">He would writhe his body to and fro.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span> That man, Brethren, would know:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I shall fall into this pit of charcoal.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to that I shall come by death or mortal pain.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, a brother sees sensual pleasures<br/> in the likeness of a pit of charcoal,<br/> and, so seeing,<br/> that love of sensual pleasures,<br/> that infatuation,<br/> that feverish longing<br/> for sensual pleasures<br/> that is therein<br/> does not fasten on him.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, does a brother<br/> so practise his path abroad<br/> and his lodging at home<br/> that, so practising,<br/> so dwelling,<br/> covetousness and dejection,<br/> those evil, unprofitable states,<br/> do not fasten on him?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, a man should enter<br/> a forest full of thorns.</p>

    <p class="f4">To the east of him are thorns.</p>

    <p class="f4">To the west of him are thorns.</p>

    <p class="f4">To the north of him are thorns.</p>

    <p class="f4">To the south of him are thorns.</p>

    <p class="f4">Below him are thorns.</p>

    <p class="f4">Above him are thorns.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherever he advances or retreats,<br/> he has the thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'May no thorns pierce me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, Brethren, whatsoever object in the world<br/> is dear and delightful, -<br/> that in the Ariyan discipline<br/> is called 'the thorn.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Brethren, comes non-restraint?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother,<br/> seeing an object with the eye,<br/> is attached to objects that are dear,<br/> is averse from objects that displease.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells with attention to body distracted,<br/> and his thought is mean.</p>
