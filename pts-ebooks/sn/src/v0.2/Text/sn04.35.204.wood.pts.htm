    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a certain brother went to visit another brother,<br/> and on coming to him said: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, friend, how far is a brother's insight fully purified?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, when a brother understands,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising and the destruction<br/> of the sixfold sense-sphere,<br/> to that extent is his insight fully developed."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[125]</b></span> But that brother was dissatisfied<br/> with the other's answer to his question,<br/> and went away to another brother,<br/> and on coming to him said: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, friend, how far is a brother's insight fully purified?"</p>

    <p class="f4">He replied: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, when a brother understands,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising and the destruction<br/> of the five factors of grasping,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> to that extent his insight is fully purified."</p>

    <p class="f4">But again that brother,<br/> dissatisfied<br/> with the other's answer to his question,<br/> and went away to another brother,<br/> and on coming to him said: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, friend, how far is a brother's insight fully purified?"</p>

    <p class="f4">He replied: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, when a brother understands,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising and the destruction<br/> of the four great essentials,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> to that extent is his insight fully purified."</p>

    <p class="f4">Again that brother<br/> was dissatisfied<br/> with the other's answer to his question,<br/> and went away to another brother,<br/> and on coming to him said: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, friend, how far is a brother's insight fully purified?"</p>

    <p class="f4">He replied: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, when a brother understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> that whatsoever is of a nature to arise,<br/> all that is of a nature to cease,<br/> to that extent his insight is fully purified."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon that brother,<br/> being dissatisfied,<br/> went to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> that brother said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, I went to a certain brother<br/> and asked this question of him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, friend, how far is a brother's insight fully purified?"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words, lord,<br/> that brother replied:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, when a brother understands,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising and the destruction<br/> of the sixfold sense-sphere,<br/> to that extent is his insight fully developed."</p>

    <p class="f4">But I was dissatisfied<br/> with that brother's answer to his question,<br/> and went away to another brother<br/> and asked this question of him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, friend, how far is a brother's insight fully purified?"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words, lord,<br/> that brother replied:</p>

    <p class="f4">But I was dissatisfied<br/> with that brother's answer,<br/> went away to another brother<br/> and asked this question of him:</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words, lord,<br/> that brother replied:</p>

    <p class="f4">So, lord, being dissatisfied<br/> with these answers to my question<br/> I am come to the Exalted One<br/> (and now I ask):</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, brother, a man who had never seen a Judas tree.</p>

    <p class="f4">So he went to a certain man<br/> who had seen one,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> and on coming to him asked him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

    <p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, my man, the Judas <span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span> tree is blackish,<br/> something like a charred stump.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being,<br/> the Judas tree is to him as that other man sees it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Well, the man is not satisfied<br/> with the answer to his question,<br/> so he goes away to another man who had seen one<br/> and on coming to him asked him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

    <p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, my man, the Judas tree is reddish,<br/> something like a lump of flesh.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being<br/> the Judas tree is to him as that other man sees it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Still dissatisfied<br/> with the reply to his question,<br/> he goes away to another man who had seen one<br/> and on coming to him asked him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

    <p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Why, my man, a Judas tree is stripped of its bark.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It has its pods burst,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> something like an acacia tree.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being<br/> the Judas tree is to him as that other man sees it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Well, the man is not satisfied<br/> with the reply to his question,<br/> so he goes away to see yet another man who had seen a Judas tree,<br/> and on coming to him asked him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

    <p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well, my man, the Judas tree is very thick-leaved.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It gives a close shade,<br/> just like a banyan tree.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being a Judas tree is to him as that other sees it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, brother, according as the insight<br/> of those good folk<br/> is fully purified,<br/> in accordance with that<br/> they give their explanation of it.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">In the same way, brother,<br/> the insight of these worthies<br/> is fully purified<br/> according to their several bents,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> and they give their explanation accordingly.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">It is even as some rajah's border-town,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> brother,<br/> strongly built<br/> with walls and towers,<br/> and having six gates to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">This town has a wise and watchful<br/> warden of the gates,<br/> who keeps out enemies<br/> and welcomes friends.</p>

    <p class="f4">From the east there comes a pair of swift messengers,<br/> and they say unto the <span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span> warden of the gates:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Good fellow, where is the lord of this town?'</p>

    <p class="f4">And he replies:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yonder he sits in the midst where the four ways meet.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then those twin messengers<br/> deliver unto the lord of the town<br/> the message of the Truth,<br/> and go their ways<br/> by the path by which they came.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he replies:</p>

    <p class="f4">From the south there comes a pair of swift messengers,<br/> and they say unto the warden of the gates:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Good fellow, where is the lord of this town?'</p>

    <p class="f4">And he replies:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, brother, have I made you a parable,||<br/> and for your understanding of it<br/> this is the explanation: -</p>

    <p class="f4">'Having six gates,' brother, -||<br/> this is a name for the personal sixfold sense-sphere.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'Warden of the gates,' brother, -||<br/> this is a name for mindfulness.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'Pair of swift messengers,' brother, -||<br/> this is a name for calm and insight.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord of the town,' brother,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> -||<br/> this is a name for consciousness.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'In the midst,||<br/> where four ways meet,' brother, -||<br/> this is a name for the four great essentials,||<br/> the elements of earth, water, fire and air.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Message of the Truth,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> brother, -||<br/> this is a name for Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">'By the way they came,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> brother, -||<br/> this is a name for the Ariyan Eightfold Path,||<br/> to wit</p>
