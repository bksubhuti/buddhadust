    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are these three feelings, brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">Feelings that are pleasant,<br/> feelings that are painful,<br/> feelings that are neither pleasant nor painful.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pleasant feelings, Brethren,<br/> should be regarded as Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Painful feelings should be regarded as a barb.</p>

    <p class="f4">Neutral feelings should be regarded as impermanence.</p>

    <p class="f4">When a brother regards pleasant feelings as ill,<br/> painful feelings as a barb,<br/> neutral feelings as impermanence,<br/> such an one is called, Brethren,<br/> 'rightly seeing.'|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">He has cut off craving,<br/> broken the bond,<br/> by perfect comprehension of conceit<br/> he has made an end of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Who sees that pleasure is an ill and pain a piercing barb,<br/> Who sees the state of neutral feeling is impermanent,<br/> That brother rightly sees indeed and feelings understands,<br/> He, understanding feelings, in this life is drug-immune:<br/> When body dies, - a saint, lore-perfect, past our reckoning.</p>
