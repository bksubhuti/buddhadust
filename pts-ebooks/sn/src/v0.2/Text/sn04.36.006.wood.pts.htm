    <hr/>

    <p><span class="f2">[207]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The untaught manyfolk, Brethren,<br/> feels feeling that is pleasant,<br/> feeling that is painful<br/> and feeling that is neutral.</p>

    <p class="f4">The well-taught Ariyan disciple, Brethren,<br/> feels feeling that is pleasant,<br/> feeling that is painful<br/> and feeling that is neutral.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein, Brethren,<br/> what is the distinction,<br/> what is the specific feature,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> what is the difference<br/> between the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> and the untaught manyfolk?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br/> things have the Exalted one as their root,<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br/> if the meaning of this that has been spoken<br/> were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/> the brethren will remember it."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"The untaught manyfolk, Brethren,<br/> being touched by feeling that is painful,<br/> weeps and wails,<br/> cries aloud,<br/> knocks the breast,<br/> falls into utter bewilderment.</p>

    <p class="f4">For he feels a twofold feeling,<br/> bodily<br/> and mental.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, they pierce a man with a barb,<br/> then with a second barb,<br/> just so, Brethren,<br/> that man feels the pain of two barbs.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus does the untaught manyfolk<br/> being touched by feeling that is painful,<br/> weep and wail,<br/> cries aloud,<br/> knock the breast,<br/> fall into utter bewilderment.</p>

    <p class="f4">For he feels a twofold feeling,<br/> bodily<br/> and mental.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span> Touched by that painful feeling<br/> he feels repugnance for it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling that repugnance for the painful feeling,<br/> the lurking tendency to repugnance<br/> fastens on him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Touched by the painful feeling,<br/> he delights in pleasant feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">The untaught manyfolk, Brethren,<br/> knows of no refuge from painful feeling<br/> save sensual pleasure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Delighting in that sensual pleasure,<br/> the lurking tendency to sensual pleasure<br/> fastens on him.</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the arising<br/> and the destruction of feelings,<br/> nor the satisfaction,<br/> the misery,<br/> the way of escape from feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he understands them not,<br/> the lurking tendency to ignorance of neutral feeling<br/> fastens on him.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he feels feeling that is pleasant,<br/> he feels it as one in bondage.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">If he feels feeling that is painful,<br/> he feels it as one in bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he feels feeling that is neutral,<br/> he feels it as one in bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">This untaught many-folk, Brethren, is called<br/> 'in bondage to birth,<br/> death,<br/> sorrow<br/> and grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is in bondage to ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But, Brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple,<br/> when touched by painful feeling,<br/> weeps not,<br/> wails not,<br/> cries not aloud,<br/> knocks not the breast,<br/> falls not into utter bewilderment.</p>

    <p class="f4">He feels but one feeling,<br/> the bodily,<br/> not the mental.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, they pierce a man with a barb,<br/> but do not pierce him with a second barb.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus that man feels<br/> but the pain caused by the one barb.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, the well-taught Arivan disciple,<br/> when touched by painful feeling,<br/> weeps not,<br/> wails not,<br/> cries not aloud,<br/> knocks not the breast,<br/> falls not into utter bewilderment.</p>

    <p class="f4">He feels but one feeling,<br/> bodily pain,<br/> not mental.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, he has no repugnance for painful feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he has no repugnance for it,<br/> the lurking tendency to repugnance for painful feeling<br/> fastens not on him.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, when touched by painful feeling,<br/> delights not in sensual pleasure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, Brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> knows of a refuge from painful feeling<br/> apart from sensual ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he delights not in sensual ease,<br/> the <span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span> lurking tendency to sensual ease<br/> fastens not on him.</p>

    <p class="f4">As be understands, as they really are,<br/> both the arising<br/> and the destruction<br/> of these feelings,<br/> the satisfaction,<br/> the misery of them,<br/> the way of escape therefrom,<br/> the lurking tendency to ignorance of neutral feeling<br/> fastens not on him.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he feels a feeling that is pleasant,<br/> he feels it as one freed from bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he feels a feeling that is painful,<br/> he feels it as one that is freed from bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he feels a neutral feeling,<br/> he feels it as one that is freed from bondage.</p>

    <p class="f4">This well-taught Ariyan disciple, Brethren,<br/> is called<br/> 'freed from the bondage of birth,<br/> old age,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> from sorrow and grief,<br/> from woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is freed from the bondage of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, Brethren, is the distinction,<br/> the specific feature,<br/> the difference<br/> between the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> and the untaught manyfolk.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Not swayed by feelings is the sage. Nor ease<br/> Nor pain affects him of knowledge wide.<br/> Betwixt the wise man and the worldly one<br/> Vast is the difference in goodliness.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">A searcher of the Norm,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> of knowledge wide,<br/> Who rightly views this world and that beyond,<br/> Is not heart-harassed by things desired:<br/> By undesired things he is not repelled.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">By his disinclination and dislike<br/> They're blown away, departed, are no more.<br/> Knowing the stainless path and sorrowless,<br/> He rightly knows, becoming he's overpassed.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
