    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother went to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> that brother said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Here, lord, as I was meditating alone<br/> this reflection arose in me:</p>

    <p class="f4">Three feelings have been spoken of by the Exalted One:<br/> pleasant feeling,<br/> painful feeling<br/> and neutral feeling:<br/> these three.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One has said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/> that is joined with ill."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, concerning what was this saying uttered:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever is experienced,<br/> that is joined with ill'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, brother!</p>

    <p class="f4">These three feelings were named by me,<br/> and I said also,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/> that is joined with ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, brother, this saying of mine<br/> was uttered concerning<br/> the impermanence of compounded things.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">This saying of mine,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/> that is joined with ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span> was uttered concerning<br/> the perishable nature of compounded things.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">This saying of mine,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/> that is joined with ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4">was uttered concerning<br/> transient nature<br/> of compounded things.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">This saying of mine,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/> that is joined with ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4">was uttered concerning<br/> their nature to fade away<br/> of compounded things.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/> that is joined with ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4">was uttered concerning<br/> their nature to cease<br/> of compounded things.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, brother, I have seen,<br/> that the ceasing of the activities is gradual.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/> speech has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/> thought initial and sustained has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/> zest has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/> in-breathing and out-breathing have ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite space,<br/> perception of objects has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/> perception of the realm of infinite space has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of nothingness,<br/> the perception of the realm of infinite consciousness has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br/> the perception of the realm of nothingness has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">Both perception and feeling have ceased<br/> when one has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/> lust is extinguished,<br/> hatred is extinguished,<br/> illusion is extinguished.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, brother, I have seen<br/> that the mastery of the activities is gradual.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/> speech is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/> thought initial and sustained is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/> zest is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/> in-breathing and out-breathing is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite space,<br/> perception of objects is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/> perception of the realm of infinite space is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/> lust is mastered,<br/> hatred is mastered,<br/> illusion is mastered.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these six calmings, brother.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/> speech is calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/> thought initial and sustained<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> is calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/> zest is calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/> in-breathing and out-breathing is calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the trance where perception and feeling have ceased,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> perception and feeling are calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/> lust is calmed down,<br/> hatred is calmed down,<br/> illusion is calmed down."</p>
