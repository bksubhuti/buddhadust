    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, what are the feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the arising of feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the ceasing of feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">What the way leading to the ceasing of feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the satisfaction?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the misery?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the refuge from feeling?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are these three feelings, Ānanda:<br/> pleasant feeling,<br/> painful feeling,<br/> neutral feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, Ānanda, are called feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">By the arising of contact<br/> comes the arising of feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">By the ceasing of contact<br/> comes the ceasing of feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">This Ariyan Eightfold Path<br/> is the way leading to the ceasing of feelings,<br/> namely:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right belief,<br/> right intention,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right contemplation.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That pleasure, that mental ease which arises owing to feeling, - that is called</p>

    <p class="f4">'the satisfaction of feeling.'</p>

    <p class="f4">As to the feelings which are impermanent, painful, changeable by nature, - these are called</p>

    <p class="f4">'the misery of feeling.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust for feeling, that abandoning of desire and lust for feeling, - that is the refuge from feeling.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, Ānanda, I have seen,<br/> the ceasing of the activities to be gradual.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/> speech has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/> thought initial and sustained has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/> zest has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/> in-breathing and out-breathing have ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite space,<br/> perception of objects has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/> perception of the realm of infinite space has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of nothingness,<br/> the perception of the realm of infinite consciousness has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br/> the perception of the realm of nothingness has ceased.</p>

    <p class="f4">Both perception and feeling have ceased<br/> when one has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/> lust is extinguished,<br/> hatred is extinguished,<br/> illusion is extinguished.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, I have seen<br/> that the mastery of the activities is gradual.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/> speech is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/> thought initial and sustained is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/> zest is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/> in-breathing and out-breathing is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite space,<br/> perception of objects is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/> perception of the realm of infinite space is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of nothingness,<br/> the perception of the realm of infinite consciousness is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br/> the perception of the realm of nothingness is mastered.</p>

    <p class="f4">Both perception and feeling are mastered<br/> when one has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/> lust is mastered,<br/> hatred is mastered,<br/> illusion is mastered.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these six calmings, Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/> speech is calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/> thought initial and sustained is calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/> zest is calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/> in-breathing and out-breathing is calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the trance where perception and feeling have ceased,<br/> perception and feeling are calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/> lust is calmed down,<br/> hatred is calmed down,<br/> illusion is calmed down."</p>
