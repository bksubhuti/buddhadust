    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said: -</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these five sensual elements, Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Objects cognizable by the eve,<br/> desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sounds<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> cognizable by the ear,<br/> desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, Ānanda, are the five sensual elements.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">That pleasure,<br/> that happiness<br/> that arises owing to the five sensual elements, -<br/> that, Ānanda,<br/> is called "sensual pleasure."</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, Ānanda, another pleasure,<br/> still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, a brother,<br/> aloof from sensuality,<br/> aloof from evil conditions,<br/> enters on the first trance,<br/> which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/> which is born of solitude,<br/> easeful and zestful,<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, <span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span> Ānanda, is another pleasure<br/> still more excellent<br/> still more exquisite<br/> than that one.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is a pleasure<br/> still more excellent,<br/> still more exquisite<br/> than that other.</p>

    <p class="f4">'The balanced thoughtful man<br/> dwells happily.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he enters on the third trance<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, a brother,<br/> rejecting pleasure and pain,<br/> by the coming to an end<br/> of the joy and sorrow<br/> which he had before,<br/> enters on<br/> and abides in<br/> the fourth trance,<br/> which is free of pain<br/> and free of pleasure,<br/> but is a state of perfect purity<br/> of balance<br/> and equanimity.</p>
