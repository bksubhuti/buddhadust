    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are two feelings, brethren,<br/> in mv way of explaining.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are also three feelings, brethren,<br/> in my way of explaining.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are also five feelings, brethren,<br/> in my way of explaining.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are also six feelings, brethren,<br/> in my way of explaining.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are also eighteen feelings, brethren,<br/> in my way of explaining.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are also thirty-six feelings, brethren,<br/> in my way of explaining.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are also one hundred and eight feelings in mv way of explaining, brethren.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Such is the exposition of the Norm taught by me, brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Though I have thus expounded my method of teaching the Norm, brethren,<br/> of those who will not approve of,<br/> will not agree with,<br/> each other's exposition of it,<br/> however well said and spoken, -<br/> of such you may expect this:</p>

    <p class="f4">They will dwell quarrelsome,<br/> wrangling,<br/> disputatious,<br/> wounding each other with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Now such is the method of the Norm,<br/> as expounded by me.</p>

    <p class="f4">When I have so expounded it,<br/> those who approve of,<br/> agree with,<br/> each other's exposition of it,<br/> being well said and spoken, -<br/> of such you may expect this:</p>

    <p class="f4">They will dwell in harmony,<br/> courteous,<br/> without quarrelling,<br/> like milk and water mixed,<br/> looking on one another<br/> with the eye of affection.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these five sensual elements, brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Objects cognizable by the eve,<br/> desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sounds cognizable by the ear,<br/> desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Scents cognizable by the nose,<br/> desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Savours cognizable by the tongue,<br/> desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Tangibles cognizable by the body,<br/> desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, brethren, are the five sensual elements.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">That pleasure,<br/> that happiness<br/> that arises owing to the five sensual elements, -<br/> that, brethren,<br/> is called "sensual pleasure."</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, brethren, there may be some who aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/> that beings experience.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/> I do not allow.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/> still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/> aloof from sensuality,<br/> aloof from evil conditions,<br/> enters on the first trance,<br/> which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/> which is born of solitude,<br/> easeful and zestful,<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is another pleasure<br/> still more excellent<br/> still more exquisite<br/> than that one.</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/> that beings can experience.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/> I do not allow.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/> still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/> by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/> enters on the inward calm,<br/> that single-mindedness of will,<br/> apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of mental balance,<br/> zestful and full of ease,<br/> which is the second trance.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/> still more excellent,<br/> still more exquisite<br/> than that other.</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/> that beings can experience.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/> I do not allow.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/> still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/> by the fading out of zest<br/> becomes balanced<br/> and remains mindful and composed,<br/> and experiences with the body<br/> the happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The balanced thoughtful man<br/> dwells happily.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he enters on the third trance<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/> still more excellent,<br/> still more exquisite<br/> than that other.</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/> that beings can experience.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/> I do not allow.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/> still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/> rejecting pleasure and pain,<br/> by the coming to an end<br/> of the joy and sorrow<br/> which he had before,<br/> enters on<br/> and abides in<br/> the fourth trance,<br/> which is free of pain<br/> and free of pleasure,<br/> but is a state of perfect purity<br/> of balance<br/> and equanimity.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/> still more excellent,<br/> still more exquisite<br/> than that other.</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/> that beings can experience.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/> I do not allow.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/> still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/> passing utterly beyond the perception of objects,<br/> by the coming to an end<br/> of perception of resistance,<br/> by not attending to perception of diversity,<br/> with the idea of<br/> 'infinite is space,'<br/> attains<br/> and abides in<br/> the realm of the infinity of space.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/> still more excellent,<br/> still more exquisite<br/> than that other.</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/> that beings can experience.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/> I do not allow.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/> still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/> passing utterly beyond the realm of infinite space,<br/> with the idea of<br/> 'infinite is consciousness,'<br/> attains<br/> and abides in<br/> the realm of infinite consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/> still more excellent,<br/> still more exquisite<br/> than that other.</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/> that beings can experience.'</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/> still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/> passing utterly beyond the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/> with the idea:<br/> 'There is nothing at all,'<br/> attains<br/> and abides in<br/> the realm of nothingness.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/> still more excellent,<br/> still more exquisite<br/> than that other.</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/> that beings can experience.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/> I do not allow.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/> still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/> passing utterly beyond the realm of nothingness,<br/> attains<br/> and abides in<br/> the realm which neither is nor is not perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/> still more excellent,<br/> still more exquisite<br/> than that other.</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/> that beings can experience.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/> I do not allow.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/> still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/> passing utterly beyond the realm<br/> which neither is nor is not perception,<br/> attains<br/> and abides in<br/> (a state which is)<br/> the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, brethren,<br/> is a pleasure<br/> still more excellent,<br/> still more exquisite<br/> (than that other).</p>

    <p class="f4">But, brethren,<br/> there is a possibility<br/> that the Wanderers who hold other views might aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Gotama the recluse spoke<br/> of the cessation of perception and feeling,<br/> and proclaims that as pleasure.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the meaning of this<br/> and how is this?'</p>

    <p class="f4">The Wanderers who hold other views, brethren,<br/> should be replied to thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friends, the Exalted One did not proclaim that<br/> as pleasure in connection with just pleasant feeling:<br/> but wheresoever, friends, pleasure is obtained,<br/> the Exalted One proclaims just that pleasure,<br/> howsoever<br/> and of whatsoever nature,<br/> as pleasure.'"</p>
