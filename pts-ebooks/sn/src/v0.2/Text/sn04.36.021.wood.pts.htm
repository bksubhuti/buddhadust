    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Wanderer Sīvaka of the Top-knot<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> paid a visit to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him in friendly wise, and after the exchange of greetings and <span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span> courtesies, sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer Slvaka of the Top-knot<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are some recluses and brahmins, master Gotama,<br/> who say thus,<br/> who hold this view:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever pleasure or pain or mental state<br/> a human being experiences,<br/> all that is due to a previous act.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what says master Gotama about this?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, Sīvaka, in this connection<br/> there are some sufferings<br/> originating from bile.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">You ought to know by experience,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> Sīvaka,<br/> that this is so.</p>

    <p class="f4">And this fact,<br/> that sufferings originate from bile,<br/> is generally acknowledged by the world as true.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Sīvaka, those recluses and brahmins<br/> who say thus,<br/> who hold this view, that<br/> 'whatsoever pleasure or pain or mental state a human being experiences,<br/> all that is due to a previous act',<br/> both in what is known by personal experience<br/> and in what is generally acknowledged by the world as true, -<br/> in both they go too far.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore I declare those recluses and brahmins<br/> to be in the wrong.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Also, Sīvaka,<br/> in this connexion,<br/> there are some sufferings<br/> originating from phlegm.</p>

    <p class="f4">You ought to know by experience, Sīvaka,<br/> that this is so.</p>

    <p class="f4">And this fact,<br/> that sufferings originate from phlegm,<br/> is generally acknowledged by the world as true.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Also, Sīvaka,<br/> in this connexion,<br/> there are some sufferings<br/> originating from wind.</p>

    <p class="f4">You ought to know by experience, Sīvaka,<br/> that this is so.</p>

    <p class="f4">And this fact,<br/> that sufferings originate from wind,<br/> is generally acknowledged by the world as true.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Sīvaka, those recluses and brahmins<br/> who say thus,<br/> who hold this view, that<br/> 'whatsoever pleasure or pain or mental state a human being experiences,<br/> all that is due to a previous act',<br/> both in what is known by personal experience<br/> and in what is generally acknowledged by the world as true, -<br/> in both they go too far.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words the Wanderer Sīvaka of the Top-knot said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">'Excellent, master Gotama!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent it is, master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as one raises what is fallen<br/> or shows forth what is hidden,<br/> or points out the way<br/> to him that wanders astray,<br/> or holds up a light in the darkness<br/> so that they who have eyes may see objects,<br/> — even so in divers ways<br/> has Dhamma, been set forth<br/> by master Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">I myself go for refuge to Gotama,<br/> the Exalted One,<br/> to Dhamma<br/> and the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama<br/> accept me as a follower<br/> from this day forth,<br/> so long as life lasts,<br/> as one who has so taken refuge.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">With bile, phlegm, wind, the union<br/> Of humours, seasons' changes and the stress<br/> Of circumstance and awkward happenings,||<br/> The ripeness of one's karma makes the eighth.</p>
