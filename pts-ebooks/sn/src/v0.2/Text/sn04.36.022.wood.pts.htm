    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you an exposition of the Norm, brethren,<br/> according to the method of the one hundred and eight.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, is that exposition of the Norm?</p>

    <p class="f4">There are two feelings, brethren,<br/> in my way of expounding.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are also three,<br/> five,<br/> six,<br/> eighteen,<br/> thirty-six,<br/> and one hundred and eight feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the two feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">They are bodily and mental feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, brethren, are called 'the two feelings.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the three feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">They are pleasant, painful and neutral feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, brethren, are called 'the three feelings.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the five feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">They are the controlling powers<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of pleasure,<br/> pain,<br/> joy,<br/> grief<br/> and indifference.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, brethren, are 'the five feelings'.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the six feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">They are the feeling<br/> born of eye-contact,<br/> ear-contact,<br/> nose-contact,<br/> tongue-contact,<br/> body-contact<br/> and mind-contact.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, brethren, are 'the six feelings'.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the eighteen feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">They are the six ways of giving attention<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> to joy,<br/> grief<br/> and indifference.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, brethren, are 'the eighteen feelings'.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the thirty-six feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">They are the six forms of joy concerned with the worldly life,<br/> the six forms of joy concerned with giving up:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> they are the six forms of grief concerned with the worldly life<br/> and six forms of grief concerned with giving up:<br/> there are six forms of indifference concerned with the worldly life<br/> and six forms of indifference concerned with giving up.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, brethren, are called 'the thirty-six feelings.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the one hundred and eight feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">There are thirty-six feelings of the past,<br/> thirty-six of the future,<br/> and thirty-six feelings of the present time.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, brethren, are the one hundred and eight feelings,<br/> and this is the method of expounding the Norm according to the one hundred and eight.</p>
