    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side that brother said this: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"What, lord, are the feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">What the arising of feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the way leading to the arising of feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the ceasing of feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the way leading to their ceasing?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the satisfaction,<br/> the misery of feelings,<br/> what is the way of escape from feelings?</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these three feelings, brother:<br/> pleasant feelings,<br/> painful feelings<br/> and neutral feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, brother, are called<br/> 'the three feelings.'</p>

    <p class="f4">From the arising of contact<br/> comes the arising of feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">Craving is the way<br/> leading to the arising of feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">By the ceasing of contact<br/> comes the ceasing of feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">This Ariyan Eightfold Path, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right belief,<br/> right intention,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right contemplation,<br/> is the way leading to the ceasing of feelings.</p>

    <p class="f4">The pleasure and happiness<br/> which arise owing to feeling, -<br/> that is the satisfaction in feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">The misery of feeling<br/> is the impermanence,<br/> the pain,<br/> the unsubstantial nature of feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">The abolishing of desire and lust,<br/> the abandoning of desire and lust, -<br/> that is the escape from feelings.'</p>
