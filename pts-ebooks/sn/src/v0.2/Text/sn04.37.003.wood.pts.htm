    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are these five special<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> woes, Brethren,<br/> which a woman has to undergo<br/> as apart from a man.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a woman<br/> at a tender age<br/> goes to her husband's family<br/> and leaves her relatives behind.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the first special woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Brethren, a woman is subject to menses.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the second woe. <span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Brethren, a woman is subject to pregnancy.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the third woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Brethren, a woman has to bring forth.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the fourth woe.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Brethren, a woman has to wait upon<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> a man.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the fifth special woe<br/> which a woman has to undergo<br/> as apart from a man.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, Brethren, are the five special woes<br/> which a woman has to undergo<br/> as apart from a man."</p>
