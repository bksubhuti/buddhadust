    <p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are these five powers in a woman, brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The power of beauty,<br/> the power of wealth,<br/> the power of kin,<br/> the power of sons,<br/> the power of virtue.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, a woman is possessed<br/> of the power of beauty,<br/> but not of the power of virtue.</p>

    <p class="f4">They cause her overthrow.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Vāsenti.</i> <i>Pali Dict.</i> takes the word as simply 'preserve'; but <i>Comy.</i> says: 'Saying "she has trespassed beyond bounds," they take her by the neck and throw her out. They do not "let her stay" in the family.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="demi"/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> PTS text and Woodward omit this variation which is included in the BJT. Further, I believe the subsequent versions should follow in diminishing number of powers rather than singly so that the sutta ends with the woman possessing only virtue and no other powers but is still retained by the family, but no text supports this.</p>
