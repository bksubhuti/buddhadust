    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying among the folk of Magadha,<br/> at Nālaka village.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Wanderer, Rose-apple-eater came to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> and on coming to him greeted him in friendly wise,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer, Rose-apple-eater,<br/> said to the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"They say, 'Arahantship, Arahantship' friend Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, friend, what is Arahantship?</p>

    <p class="f4">"The destruction of lust, friend,<br/> the destruction of hatred,<br/> the destruction of illusion, -<br/> that is called Arahantship."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But is there, friend, any path,<br/> any approach<br/> to the realization of this Arahantship?</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is such a path, friend,<br/> there is such an approach."</p>

    <p class="f4">"And what is that path, friend,<br/> what is that approach<br/> to the realization of this Arahantship?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, friend,<br/> for the realization of Arahantship,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, friend, is this path,<br/> this approach<br/> to the realization of Arahantship."</p>

    <p class="f4">A goodly path, friend,<br/> a goodly approach<br/> to the realization of this Arahantship<br/> and a proper occasion for earnestness too, friend!"</p>
