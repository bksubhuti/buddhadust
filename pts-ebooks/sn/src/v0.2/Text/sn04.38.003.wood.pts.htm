    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying among the folk of Magadha,<br/> at Nālaka village.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Wanderer, Rose-apple-eater came to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> and on coming to him greeted him in friendly wise,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer, Rose-apple-eater,<br/> said to the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Who, pray, friend Sāriputta,<br/> are Norm-preachers in the world,<br/> who are well-practised in the world,<br/> who are happy ones in the world?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"They, friend, who teach a Norm<br/> for abandoning lust in the world,<br/> for abandoning hatred in the world,<br/> for abandoning illusion in the world,<br/> they are Norm-preachers in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">They, friend, who are practised<br/> in the abandoning of lust,<br/> in the abandoning of hatred<br/> in the abandoning of illusion,<br/> they are well practised in the world.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">They, friend, whose lust is abandoned,<br/> cut off at the root,<br/> made like a palm-tree stump,<br/> made unable to grow again in the future,<br/> of a nature not to arise again;<br/> they whose hatred is abandoned,<br/> cut off at the root,<br/> made like a palm-tree stump,<br/> made unable to grow again in the future,<br/> of a nature not to arise again;<br/> they whose illusion is abandoned,<br/> cut off at the root,<br/> made like a palm-tree stump,<br/> made unable to grow again in the future,<br/> of a nature not to arise again -<br/> they, friend, are happy ones in the world.'|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, friend, is there any way,<br/> any approach<br/> to the abandoning of this lust,<br/> this hatred,<br/> this illusion?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is such a path, friend,<br/> there is such an approach."</p>

    <p class="f4">"And what is that path, friend,<br/> what is that approach<br/> to the abandoning of this lust,<br/> this hatred,<br/> this illusion?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, friend,<br/> for the abandoning of this lust,<br/> this hatred,<br/> this illusion<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, friend, is this path,<br/> this approach<br/> to the abandoning of this lust,<br/> this hatred,<br/> this illusion."</p>

    <p class="f4">A goodly path, friend,<br/> a goodly approach<br/> to the abandoning of this lust,<br/> this hatred,<br/> this illusion<br/> and a proper occasion for earnestness too, friend!"</p>
