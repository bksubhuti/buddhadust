    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying among the Vajjī,<br/> at Ukkāvelā<br/> on the banks of the river Ganges.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Sāmaṇḍaka, the Wanderer, came to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him in friendly wise,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer Sāmaṇḍaka said this to the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Ignorance, ignorance!' is the saying, friend Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray what is ignorance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not understanding about ill, friend,<br/> not understanding about the arising of ill,<br/> not understanding about the ceasing of ill,<br/> not understanding about the way leading to the ceasing of ill, -<br/> this, friend, is called 'ignorance.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, friend, is there any way,<br/> any approach<br/> to the abandoning of this ill?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is such a path, friend,<br/> there is such an approach<br/> to the abandoning of this ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">"And what is that path, friend,<br/> what is that approach<br/> to the abandoning of this ill?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, friend,<br/> to the abandoning of this ill<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, friend, is this path,<br/> this approach<br/> to the abandoning of this ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">A goodly path, friend,<br/> a goodly approach<br/> to the abandoning of this ill<br/> and a proper occasion for earnestness too, friend!"</p>
