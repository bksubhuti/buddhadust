    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying among the Vajjī,<br/> at Ukkāvelā<br/> on the banks of the river Ganges.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Sāmaṇḍaka, the Wanderer, came to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him in friendly wise,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer Sāmaṇḍaka said this to the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, friend Sāriputta, what is hard to do<br/> in this Norm-discipline?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Going forth, friend, is hard to do<br/> in this Norm-discipline."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, friend, for one who has gone forth,<br/> what is hard to do?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For one who has gone forth, friend,<br/> to feel delight<br/> is a thing hard to do."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, friend Sāriputta,<br/> what can be hard to do<br/> for one who feels delight?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"The practice<br/> of what is in conformity with the Norm, friend,<br/> is hard to do<br/> for him who feels delight."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What then, friend?</p>

    <p class="f4">Would one who has long practised<br/> in conformity with the Norm<br/> become an Arahant?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"After no long time, friend."</p>
