    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">O<span class="f2">NCE</span> the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> addressed the brethren, saving:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Brethren.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, brother,' replied those brethren<br/> to the venerable Moggallāna the Great.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friends, when I was meditating alone here,<br/> this consideration arose in me:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"They say 'the second trance,<br/> the second trance!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what is the second trance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, friends, this occurred to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein when a brother,<br/> by the calming down<br/> of thought directed and sustained,<br/> attains the inward calm,<br/> that one-pointedness of will,<br/> apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of concentration,<br/> zestful and full of ease,<br/> which is the second trance,<br/> and abides therein,<br/> this is called the second trance.</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, friends, by the calming down<br/> of thought directed and sustained,<br/> attains the inward calm,<br/> that one-pointedness of will,<br/> apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of concentration,<br/> zestful and full of ease,<br/> entered on the second trance<br/> and abode therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when I had so done<br/> (and had emerged from trance),<br/> perception and work of mind<br/> connected with directed thought<br/> still continued.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon, friends, the Exalted One<br/> by magic power<br/> came to me and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Moggallāna,<br/> Moggallāna,<br/> be not remiss in the second trance, brahmin!</p>

    <p class="f4">Make steadfast thy mind in the second trance.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the second trance make the mind one-pointed.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the second trance compose the mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">So after that, friends, by the calming down<br/> of thought directed and sustained,<br/> attains the inward calm,<br/> that one-pointedness of will,<br/> apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of concentration,<br/> zestful and full of ease,<br/> I entered upon<br/> and abode in the second trance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, friends, if anyone would say rightly:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Helped by the Master<br/> the disciple won great super-knowledge,"</p>

    <p class="f4">he would say of me:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Helped by the Master<br/> did the disciple win great super-knowledge."'</p>
