    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">O<span class="f2">NCE</span> the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> addressed the brethren, saving:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Brethren.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, brother,' replied those brethren<br/> to the venerable Moggallāna the Great.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friends, when I was meditating alone here,<br/> this consideration arose in me:</p>

    <p class="f4">"They say 'the third trance,<br/> the third trance!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what is the third trance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, friends, this occurred to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a brother,<br/> by the fading out of zest,<br/> abides balanced<br/> and remains mindful and composed,<br/> and experiences with the body<br/> that ease of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The balanced,<br/> thoughtful man<br/> dwells happily."|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he enters on<br/> and abides in the third trance.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called "the third trance."</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, friends, by the fading out of zest,<br/> abiding balanced<br/> and remaining mindful and composed,<br/> experiencing with the body<br/> that ease of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The balanced,<br/> thoughtful man<br/> dwells happily."|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">entered the third trance<br/> and abode therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when I had thus abode<br/> (and had emerged from trance),<br/> perception and work of mind<br/> connected with zest<br/> still continued.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon, friends, the Exalted One<br/> by magic power<br/> came to me and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Moggallāna,<br/> Moggallāna,<br/> be not remiss in the third trance, brahmin!</p>

    <p class="f4">Make steadfast thy mind in the third trance.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the third trance make the mind one-pointed.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the third trance compose the mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">So after that, friends, by the fading out of zest,<br/> abiding balanced<br/> and remaining mindful and composed,<br/> experiencing with the body<br/> that ease of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The balanced,<br/> thoughtful man<br/> dwells happily."|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">entered the third trance<br/> and abode therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, friends, if anyone would say rightly:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Helped by the Master<br/> the disciple won great super-knowledge,"</p>

    <p class="f4">he would say of me:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Helped by the Master<br/> did the disciple win great super-knowledge."'</p>
