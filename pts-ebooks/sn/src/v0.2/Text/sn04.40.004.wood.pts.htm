    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">O<span class="f2">NCE</span> the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> addressed the brethren, saving:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Brethren.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, brother,' replied those brethren<br/> to the venerable Moggallāna the Great.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friends, when I was meditating alone here,<br/> this consideration arose in me:</p>

    <p class="f4">"They say 'the fourth trance,<br/> the third trance!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what is the fourth trance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, friends, this occurred to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a brother,<br/> rejecting pleasure,<br/> rejecting pain,<br/> by the coming to an end<br/> of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br/> enters on and abides in<br/> the fourth trance,<br/> which is freed from pleasure,<br/> freed from pain,<br/> but is a state<br/> of perfect purity of balance and equanimity.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called "the fourth trance."</p>

    <p class="f4">So I, friends,<br/> rejecting pleasure,<br/> rejecting pain,<br/> by the coming to an end<br/> of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br/> entered on and abode in<br/> the fourth trance,<br/> which is freed from pleasure,<br/> freed from pain,<br/> but is a state<br/> of perfect purity of balance and equanimity.</p>

    <p class="f4">But when I had thus abode<br/> (and had emerged from trance),<br/> perception and work of mind<br/> connected with happiness still continued.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span> Thereupon, friends, the Exalted One<br/> by magic power<br/> came to me and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Moggallāna,<br/> Moggallāna,<br/> be not remiss in the fourth trance, brahmin!</p>

    <p class="f4">Make steadfast thy mind in the fourth trance.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the fourth trance make the mind one-pointed.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the fourth trance compose the mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">So after that,<br/> rejecting pleasure,<br/> rejecting pain,<br/> by the coming to an end<br/> of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br/> entered on and abode in<br/> the fourth trance,<br/> which is freed from pleasure,<br/> freed from pain,<br/> but is a state<br/> of perfect purity of balance and equanimity.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, friends, if anyone would say rightly:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Helped by the Master<br/> the disciple won great super-knowledge,"</p>

    <p class="f4">he would say of me:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Helped by the Master<br/> did the disciple win great super-knowledge."'</p>
