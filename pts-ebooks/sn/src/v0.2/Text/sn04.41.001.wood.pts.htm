    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once a number of elder brethren were staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion, as this number of elder Brethren,<br/> after going their rounds<br/> and eating their meal,<br/> were sitting together in conclave at the pavilion,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> the following chance talk arose: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fetters and things that tend to fetter, friend, -<br/> are these two things different in spirit<br/> and in letter,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> or are-they one and the same spirit,<br/> but different in letter?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the matter was expounded<br/> by divers brethren<br/> in divers ways<br/> thus: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br/> both of them are different in spirit<br/> and different in letter."</p>

    <p class="f4">While others expounded the matter thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br/> both of these are one and the same in spirit,<br/> but different in letter." -</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time Citta,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> the house-father,<br/> had arrived at Migapathaka<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> on some business or other.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Citta, the <span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span> house-father, heard it said<br/> that a number of elder Brethren,<br/> after going their rounds<br/> and eating their meal,<br/> were sitting together in conclave at the pavilion,<br/> and that the following chance talk had arisen: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Fetters and things that tend to fetter, friend, -<br/> are these two things different in spirit<br/> and in letter,<br/> or are-they one and the same spirit,<br/> but different in letter?"</p>

    <p class="f4">And that thereupon the matter was expounded<br/> by divers brethren<br/> in divers ways<br/> thus: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br/> both of them are different in spirit<br/> and different in letter."</p>

    <p class="f4">While others expounded the matter thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br/> both of these are one and the same in spirit,<br/> but different in letter." -</p>

    <p class="f4">So Citta, the house-father, went to visit those elder Brethren,<br/> and on coming to them<br/> he saluted them<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Citta the house-father said to those elder brethren: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I heard, my lords, the rumour<br/> that a number of elder brethren,<br/> after going their rounds<br/> and eating their meal,<br/> were sitting together in conclave at the pavilion,<br/> and that the following chance talk had arisen: -</p>

    <p class="f4">'Fetters and things that tend to fetter, friend, -<br/> are these two things different in spirit<br/> and in letter,<br/> or are-they one and the same spirit,<br/> but different in letter?'</p>

    <p class="f4">And that thereupon the matter was expounded<br/> by divers brethren<br/> in divers ways<br/> thus: -</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br/> both of them are different in spirit<br/> and different in letter.'</p>

    <p class="f4">While others expounded the matter thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br/> both of these are one and the same in spirit,<br/> but different in letter.' -</p>

    <p class="f4">Is it so?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is so, house-father."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, my lords, these two things,<br/> the fetter<br/> and the things that tend to fetter,<br/> are different both in spirit<br/> and in letter.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, my lords, I will make you a comparison.</p>

    <p class="f4">Maybe some wise ones here will know the meaning of what I say.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, my lords, a black steer<br/> and a white steer<br/> are yoked together<br/> by one rope<br/> or one yoke.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now he who should say<br/> that the black steer is the fetter to the white one,<br/> or the white one to the black one, -<br/> would he in so saying<br/> be saying rightly?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not so, house-father.</p>

    <p class="f4">The black steer is not a fetter to the white one,<br/> nor is the white one a fetter to the black one.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the fact of their being yoked<br/> by one rope<br/> or yoke, -<br/> that is a fetter."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, my lords, just so<br/> the eye is not a fetter of objects,<br/> nor objects a fetter to the eye.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to the pair of them, -<br/> that is the fetter.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear is not a fetter to sounds,<br/> nor sounds a fetter to the ear.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to the pair of them, -<br/> that is the fetter.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose is not a fetter to scents,<br/> nor scents a fetter to the nose.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to the pair of them, -<br/> that is the fetter.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue is not a fetter to savours,<br/> nor savours a fetter to the tongue.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to the pair of them, -<br/> that is the fetter.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The body is not a fetter to tangibles,<br/> nor tangibles a fetter to the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to the pair of them, -<br/> that is the fetter.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind is not a fetter to mind-states,<br/> nor mind-states a fetter to the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br/> owing to the pair of them, -<br/> that is the fetter."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good for you, house-father.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well gotten for you, house-father,<br/> that in you the eye of wisdom<br/> is conversant with<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> the profound teaching of the Enlightened One."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This village ('fishers' clump) near Sāvatthī, was the home of Citta (pron. Chitta) the house-father, to whom the Grove belonged. See <i>Brethren,</i> 107.</p>
