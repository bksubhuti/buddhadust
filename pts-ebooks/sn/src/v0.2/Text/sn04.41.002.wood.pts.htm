    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once a number of elder<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> brethren were staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br/> in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father, went to visit those elder Brethren,<br/> and on coming to them<br/> saluted them<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated Citta, the house-father, said to those elder brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let my lords the elders accept of me tomorrow's meal."</p>

    <p class="f4">And those elder brethren accepted by silence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the house-father,<br/> understanding the acceptance of those elder Brethren,<br/> rose from his seat,<br/> saluted the elder brethren by the right<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the elder Brethren, when the night was gone,<br/> robed themselves at early dawn,<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe<br/> went to the dwelling of Citta, the house-father,<br/> and on reaching it<br/> sat down on seats prepared.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father, came to those elder Brethren,<br/> and saluting them<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the house-father,<br/> said to the venerable (chief) elder: -<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"They say, lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Diversity of elements,<br/> diversity of elements.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far was diversity of elements<br/> spoken of by the Exalted One?</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words<br/> the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a second time did Citta, the house-father,<br/> say to the venerable (chief) elder: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"They say, lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Diversity of elements,<br/> diversity of elements.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far was diversity of elements<br/> spoken of by the Exalted One?</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time,<br/> at these words<br/> the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a third time did Citta, the house-father,<br/> say to the venerable (chief) elder: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"They say, lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Diversity of elements,<br/> diversity of elements.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far was diversity of elements<br/> spoken of by the Exalted One?</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time,<br/> at these words<br/> the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Isidatta<br/> was the junior of all<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> that order of brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Isidatta<br/> said to the venerable chief elder: -</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span> My lord, may I reply<br/> to this question of Citta, the house-father?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you reply, Isidatta,<br/> to the question of Citta, the house-father." [Then said the venerable Isidatta]:</p>

    <p class="f4">"You question thus, do you not, house-father:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Diversity of elements,<br/> diversity of elements'<br/> is the saying';</p>

    <p class="f4">and you ask:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How far was diversity of elements<br/> spoken of by the Exalted One?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, house-father, this was said<br/> of diversity of elements<br/> by the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The element of eye,<br/> the element of body<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span>,<br/> the element of eye-consciousness,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">'The element of ear,<br/> the element of sounds,<br/> the element of ear-consciousness,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The element of nose,<br/> the element of scents,<br/> the element of nose-consciousness,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The element of tongue,<br/> the element of savours,<br/> the element of tongue-consciousness,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The element of body,<br/> the element of tangibles,<br/> the element of body-consciousness,</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The element of mind,<br/> the element of mind-states,<br/> the element of mind-consciousness.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far, house-father,<br/> did the Exalted One speak<br/> of the diversity of elements."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the house-father, was glad<br/> of what was said by the venerable Isidatta<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then with his own hand<br/> he served and satisfied those elder brethren<br/> with food both hard and soft.</p>

    <p class="f4">And those elder Brethren,<br/> having eaten their fill,<br/> withdrew their hands from their bowls,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> rose up<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable chief elder<br/> said to the venerable Isidatta: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for you, friend,<br/> that this question arose.</p>

    <p class="f4">This question did not occur to me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, friend Isidatta,<br/> if on another occasion such a question arises,<br/> do you reply in like manner."</p>
