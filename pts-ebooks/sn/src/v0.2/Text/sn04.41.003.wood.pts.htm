    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once a number of elder brethren were staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br/> in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father, went to visit those elder Brethren,<br/> and on coming to them<br/> saluted them<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated Citta, the house-father, said to those elder brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let my lords the elders accept of me tomorrow's meal."</p>

    <p class="f4">And those elder brethren accepted by silence.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[194]</b></span> Thereupon Citta, the house-father,<br/> understanding the acceptance of those elder Brethren,<br/> rose from his seat,<br/> saluted the elder brethren by the right<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the elder Brethren, when the night was gone,<br/> robed themselves at early dawn,<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe<br/> went to the dwelling of Citta, the house-father,<br/> and on reaching it<br/> sat down on seats prepared.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father, came to those elder Brethren,<br/> and saluting them<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the house-father,<br/> said to the venerable (chief) elder: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to these divers views<br/> that arise in the world, my lord elder,<br/> such as:</p>

    <p class="f4">Eternal is the world,<br/> not eternal is the world,<br/> finite is the world,<br/> infinite is the world,<br/> life and body are the same,<br/> life and body are different,<br/> the Tathāgata, exists after death,<br/> he exists not,<br/> he both exists and exists not,<br/> he neither exists nor exists not,<br/> also as to the sixty-two heretical views<br/> set forth in the Brahmajala,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> -</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the existence of what, lord,<br/> do these views prevail?</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the nonexistence of what<br/> do these views not prevail?"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words<br/> the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a second time did Citta, the house-father,<br/> say to the venerable (chief) elder: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to these divers views<br/> that arise in the world, my lord elder,<br/> such as:</p>

    <p class="f4">Eternal is the world,<br/> not eternal is the world,<br/> finite is the world,<br/> infinite is the world,<br/> life and body are the same,<br/> life and body are different,<br/> the Tathāgata, exists after death,<br/> he exists not,<br/> he both exists and exists not,<br/> he neither exists nor exists not,<br/> also as to the sixty-two heretical views<br/> set forth in the Brahmajala, -</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the existence of what, lord,<br/> do these views prevail?</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the nonexistence of what<br/> do these views not prevail?"</p>

    <p class="f4">And a second time,<br/> at these words<br/> the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a third time did Citta, the house-father,<br/> say to the venerable (chief) elder: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to these divers views<br/> that arise in the world, my lord elder,<br/> such as:</p>

    <p class="f4">Eternal is the world,<br/> not eternal is the world,<br/> finite is the world,<br/> infinite is the world,<br/> life and body are the same,<br/> life and body are different,<br/> the Tathāgata, exists after death,<br/> he exists not,<br/> he both exists and exists not,<br/> he neither exists nor exists not,<br/> also as to the sixty-two heretical views<br/> set forth in the Brahmajala, -</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the existence of what, lord,<br/> do these views prevail?</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the nonexistence of what<br/> do these views not prevail?"</p>

    <p class="f4">And a third time,<br/> at these words<br/> the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Isidatta<br/> was the junior of all that order of brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Isidatta<br/> said to the venerable chief elder: -</p>

    <p class="f4">My lord, may I reply<br/> to this question of Citta, the house-father?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you reply, Isidatta,<br/> to the question of Citta, the house-father." [Then said the venerable Isidatta]:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, house-father, your question was this, was it not?</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to these divers views<br/> that arise in the world, my lord elder,<br/> such as:</p>

    <p class="f4">Eternal is the world,<br/> not eternal is the world,<br/> finite is the world,<br/> infinite is the world,<br/> life and body are the same,<br/> life and body are different,<br/> the Tathāgata, exists after death,<br/> he exists not,<br/> he both exists and exists not,<br/> he neither exists nor exists not,<br/> also as to the sixty-two heretical views<br/> set forth in the Brahmajala, -</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the existence of what, lord,<br/> do these views prevail?</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the nonexistence of what<br/> do these views not prevail?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, house-father,<br/> as to those divers views<br/> that arise in the world, such as:</p>

    <p class="f4">Eternal is the world,<br/> not eternal is the world,<br/> finite is the world,<br/> infinite is the world,<br/> life and body are the same,<br/> life and body are different,<br/> the Tathāgata, exists after death,<br/> he exists not,<br/> he both exists and exists not,<br/> he neither exists nor exists not,<br/> also as to the sixty-two heretical views<br/> set forth in the Brahmajala, -</p>

    <p class="f4">it is owing to the person-pack view<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> that <span class="f2 g"><b>[195]</b></span> they arise,<br/> and if the person-pack view exists not,<br/> they do not exist."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, lord, how comes the person-pack view to be?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, house-father, the untaught manyfolk,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> who discern not those who are Ariyans,<br/> who are unskilled ill the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who are untrained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who discern not those who are worthy ones,<br/> who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/> untrained in the worthy doctrine, -</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard body as the self,<br/> they regard the self as having body,<br/> body as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard feeling as the self -<br/> they regard feeling as the self,<br/> they regard feeling as having body,<br/> feeling as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard perception as the self -<br/> they regard perception as the self,<br/> they regard perception as having body,<br/> perception as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard the activities as the self -<br/> they regard the activities as the self,<br/> they regard the activities as having body,<br/> the activities as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">They regard consciousness as the self -<br/> they regard consciousness as the self,<br/> they regard consciousness as having body,<br/> consciousness as being in the self,<br/> the self as being in consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, house-father, is how the person-pack view arises."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, lord, how is there no person-pack view?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, house-father, the well-taught Ariyan disciple,<br/> who discerns those who are Ariyans,<br/> who is skilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who is trained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/> who discerns those who are worthy ones,<br/> who is skilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/> well trained in the worthy doctrine, -</p>

    <p class="f4">such regards not body as the self,<br/> regards not the self as having body,<br/> nor body as being in the self,<br/> nor the self as being in body.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards not feeling as the self -<br/> he regards not feeling as the self,<br/> he regards not feeling as having body,<br/> nor feeling as being in the self,<br/> nor the self as being in feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards not perception as the self -<br/> he regards not perception as the self,<br/> he regards not perception as having body,<br/> nor perception as being in the self,<br/> nor the self as being in perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards not the activities as the self -<br/> he regards not the activities as the self,<br/> he regards not the activities as having body,<br/> nor the activities as being in the self,<br/> nor the self as being in the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">He regards not consciousness as the self -<br/> he regards not consciousness as the self,<br/> he regards not consciousness as having body,<br/> nor consciousness as being in the self,<br/> nor the self as being in consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how, house-father, there is no person-pack view."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whence comes the worthy Isidatta,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> my lord?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I come from Avanti,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> house-father."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, there is at Avanti<br/> a clansman named Isidatta,<br/> an <span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span> unseen friend of ours,<br/> who has gone forth (from the household life).</p>

    <p class="f4">Has your reverence seen him?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have, house-father."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray where, lord, does that venerable one now dwell?"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words the venerable Isidatta was silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is your reverence the worthy<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> Isidatta?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am, house-father."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then may the worthy Isidatta take his pleasure at Macchikasaṇḍa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lovely is Wild Mango Grove!</p>

    <p class="f4">I will do my best to supply the worthy Isidatta<br/> with the requisites of robes<br/> and alms<br/> and lodging,<br/> of comforts<br/> and medicines in time of sickness."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That is kindly said, house-father."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the house-father, was glad<br/> of what was said by the venerable Isidatta<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then with his own hand<br/> he served and satisfied those elder brethren<br/> with food both hard and soft.</p>

    <p class="f4">And those elder Brethren,<br/> having eaten their fill,<br/> withdrew their hands from their bowls,<br/> rose up<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable chief elder<br/> said to the venerable Isidatta: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for you, friend,<br/> that this question arose.</p>

    <p class="f4">This question did not occur to me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, friend Isidatta,<br/> if on another occasion such a question arises,<br/> do vriu reply in like manner."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Isidatta,<br/> having set his lodging in order,<br/> took bowl and outer robe<br/> and departed from Macchikasaṇḍa,<br/> and in thus departing from Macchikasaṇḍa<br/> he was gone for good<br/> and came not back any more.</p>
