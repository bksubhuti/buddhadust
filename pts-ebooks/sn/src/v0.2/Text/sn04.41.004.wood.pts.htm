    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once a number of elder brethren were staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br/> in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father, went to visit those elder <span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span> Brethren,<br/> and on coming to them<br/> saluted them<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated Citta, the house-father, said to those elder brethren:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let my lords the elders accept of me tomorrow's meal."</p>

    <p class="f4">And those elder brethren accepted by silence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the house-father,<br/> understanding the acceptance of those elder Brethren,<br/> rose from his seat,<br/> saluted the elder brethren by the right<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the elder Brethren, when the night was gone,<br/> robed themselves at early dawn,<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe<br/> went to the dwelling of Citta, the house-father,<br/> and on reaching it<br/> sat down on seats prepared.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father,<br/> with his own hand<br/> served the elder brethren<br/> with choice butter and milk-rice<br/> till they had eaten enough.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now when the elder brethren had eaten their fill<br/> and withdrawn hand from bowl<br/> they rose from their seats<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Citta, the house-father,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Gather up the remains,"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">followed in the steps of the elder brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/> there was a sweltering<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> heat,<br/> and the elder brethren walked<br/> with bodies melting away,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> methinks,<br/> since they had eaten well of the meal.</p>

    <p class="f4">And at that time<br/> the venerable Mahaka was the junior<br/> of that company of brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the venerable Mahaka<br/> to the venerable Chief Elder: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"It were well, my lord Chief,<br/> if a cool wind should blow<br/> and there were a thunderstorm<br/> and the sky should rain down drop by drop."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"It were indeed well, friend Mahaka,<br/> if a cool wind should blow<br/> and there were a thunderstorm<br/> and the sky should rain down drop by drop."|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Mahaka so wrought by magic <span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span> power that a cool wind blew<br/> and there was a thunderstorm<br/> and the sky rained down drop by drop.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Citta, the house-father, had this thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, even the junior of this company of brethren<br/> has such magic power!"</p>

    <p class="f4">Now when the venerable Mahaka reached the Pleasance<br/> he said to the venerable chief elder:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough of this, lord!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, friend Mahaka,<br/> enough of this!|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">You have done enough.</p>

    <p class="f4">Service enough<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> has been done, friend Mahaka."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the elder brethren went to the residence,<br/> but the venerable Mahaka went to his own lodging.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father, came to see the venerable Mahaka,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the house-father,<br/> said to the venerable Mahaka: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for me, sir,<br/> if the worthy Mahaka would show me something superhuman,<br/> some miracle of magic."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, house-father,<br/> do you put a cloak on the verandah<br/> and scatter<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> a bundle of grass."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very well, sir,"<br/> said Citta, the house-father,<br/> and did as he was bidden.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahaka went into his lodging<br/> and shot the bolt of the door,<br/> and so wrought by magic power<br/> that a flame came through the keyhole<br/> and the parts about the door-bar<br/> and set the grass on fire<br/> but not the cloak.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father,<br/> in alarm,<br/> with hair on end,<br/> beat out the cloak<br/> and stood aside.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahaka came out of his lodging<br/> and said to Citta, the house-father:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough of this, house-father!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, my lord Mahaka,<br/> enough of this!</p>

    <p class="f4">Enough has been done, my lord Mahaka.</p>

    <p class="f4">Enough service has been done, my lord Mahaka.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let my lord, the worthy Mahaka,<br/> take his pleasure in Macchikasaṇḍa.</p>

    <p class="f4">Delightful is Wild Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will do my best to supply the worthy Mahaka<br/> with the requisites of robes<br/> and alms,<br/> and lodging,<br/> comforts<br/> and medicines in time of sickness."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That is kindly said, house-father."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahaka,<br/> having set his lodging in order, <span class="f2 g"><b>[199]</b></span><br/> took bowl and outer robe<br/> and left Macchikasaṇḍa, and in thus departing from Macchikasaṇḍa<br/> he was gone for good<br/> and came not back again.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>
