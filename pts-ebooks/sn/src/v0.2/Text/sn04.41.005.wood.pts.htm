    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][niza]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Kāmabhū was staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br/> in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father, came to visit the venerable Kāmabhū,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br/> the venerable Kāmabhū said to Citta, the house-father: -</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Pure-limbed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> white-canopied, one-wheeled, the car rolls on.<br/> Lo! he that cometh: faultless, stream-cutter, bond-less he."</p>

    <p class="f4">Of this that is said in brief, house-father,<br/> how say you the Full meaning should be regarded?'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Was this said by the Exalted One, sir?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It was, house-father."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, sir, do you wait a moment<br/> while I look into the meaning of it."</p>

    <p class="f4">So Citta, the house-father, was silent a moment,<br/> and then said to the venerable Kamabhū: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Pure-limbed,' sir,<br/> is a term for the virtues.</p>

    <p class="f4">'White-canopied,' sir,<br/> is a term for release.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'One-wheeled,' sir,<br/> is a term for mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Rolls on,' sir,<br/> is a term for coming and going.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Car,' sir,<br/> is a term for body,<br/> of the four great essentials compounded,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> of parents sprung,<br/> on rice- <span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span> gruel fed,<br/> impermanent,<br/> of a nature to be worn away,<br/> pounded away,<br/> broken<br/> and scattered.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lust, sir, is a fault.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hatred is a fault.</p>

    <p class="f4">Illusion is a fault.</p>

    <p class="f4">In a brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/> these are abandoned,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/> made things that have ceased to be,<br/> so that they cannot sprout again in time to come.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore a brother who has destroyed the āsavas<br/> is 'faultless.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'That cometh,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> sir,<br/> is a term for the Arahant.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Stream,' sir,<br/> is a term for craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">In a brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/> this is abandoned,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot sprout again in time to come.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, sir, a brother who has destroyed the āsavas<br/> is called 'stream-cutter.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Lust, sir, is a bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hatred is a bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">Illusion is a bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">In a brother who has destroyed the āsavas<br/> these are abandoned,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so that it cannot sprout again in time to come.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, sir, a brother who has destroyed the āsavas<br/> is called 'boundless.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, sir, as regards what was said by the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"Pure-limbed, white-canopied, one-wheeled, the car rolls on.<br/> Lo! he that cometh: faultless, stream-cutter, bond-less he."</p>

    <p class="f4">thus, sir, should be understood in full<br/> the meaning of this saying in brief."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good for you, house-father!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well gotten for you, house-father,<br/> that in you<br/> the eye of wisdom is conversant<br/> with the profound teaching of the Enlightened One!"</p>
