    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][bit][than]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Kāmabhū was staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br/> in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father, came to visit the venerable Kāmabhū,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the house-father, said to the venerable Kāmabhū: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, how many activities<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> are there?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are three activities, house-father:<br/> those of body,<br/> those of speech<br/> those of mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, sir,' said Citta, the house-father,<br/> pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But what, sir, is the activity of body,<br/> what is the activity of speech,<br/> what is the activity of mind?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Inbreathing and out-breathing, house-father,<br/> is the activity of body;<br/> thought directed and sustained<br/> is the activity of speech:<br/> perception and feeling<br/> are the activity of mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, sir,' said Citta, the house-father,<br/> pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But why, sir, are in-breathing and out-breathing the activity of body?</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is thought directed and sustained the activity of speech?</p>

    <p class="f4">Why are perception and feeling the activity of mind?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Inbreathing and out-breathing, house-father,<br/> are bodily processes,<br/> dependent on body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore are they called<br/> 'the activity of body.'</p>

    <p class="f4">First one directs thought<br/> and sustains it,<br/> then one utters speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore is thought directed and sustained called<br/> 'the activity of speech.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Perception and feeling<br/> are mental processes<br/> dependent on mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore are they called<br/> 'the activity of mind'."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, sir,' said Citta, the house-father,<br/> pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But how, sir, comes the attainment<br/> of the ceasing of perception and feeling?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"A brother, house-father,<br/> in attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling<br/> does not think:<br/> 'I shall attain,<br/> the ceasing of perception and feeling',<br/> 'I am attaining,<br/> the ceasing of perception and feeling',<br/> 'I have attained<br/> the ceasing of perception and feeling,'<br/> but his mind has <span class="f2 g"><b>[202]</b></span> been so practised that it leads him on to the state of being such."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, sir,' said Citta, the house-father,<br/> pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, sir, in attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling,<br/> what states cease first?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is it the activity of body<br/> or of speech<br/> or of mind?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"In so attaining, house-father,<br/> a brother's activity of speech ceases first,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> then that of body,<br/> then that of mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, sir,' said Citta, the house-father,<br/> pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But a brother who has so attained,<br/> how does he differ from a dead man,<br/> from one who bas made an end?</p>

    <p class="f4">"In a dead man, house-father,<br/> in one who bas made an end,<br/> the activity of body<br/> has ceased,<br/> become calmed<br/> the activities of speech<br/> has ceased,<br/> become calmed<br/> the activities of mind<br/> has ceased,<br/> become calmed<br/></p>

    <p class="f4">Life has run out,<br/> vital heat has ceased,<br/> the faculties are scattered.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him, house-father, who has attained the ceasing of perception and feeling,<br/> the activity of body<br/> also has ceased,<br/> become calmed<br/> the activities of speech<br/> also has ceased,<br/> become calmed<br/> the activities of mind<br/> also has ceased,<br/> become calmed.</p>

    <p class="f4">But his life has not run out,<br/> vital beat has not ceased,<br/> the faculties have become clarified.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the difference between a dead man,<br/> one who bas made an end,<br/> and one who has attained the ceasing of perception and feeling."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, sir,' said Citta, the house-father,<br/> pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But how comes about the emerging<br/> from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"In emerging from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling, house-father,<br/> a brother does not think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will now emerge,<br/> from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling', 'I am emerging,<br/> from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling', 'I have now emerged from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling,'<br/> but his mind has been so practised<br/> that it leads him on to the state of being such."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, sir,' said Citta, the house-father,<br/> pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But when a brother is thus emerging<br/> from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling,<br/> what states arise first?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is it activity of body,<br/> activity of speech,<br/> or activity of mind?</p>

    <p class="f4">"In a brother so emerging from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling, house-father,<br/> activity of mind arises first,<br/> next activity of body,<br/> and last activity of speech."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[203]</b></span> "Well said, sir,' said Citta, the house-father,<br/> pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But when a brother has so emerged<br/> from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling,<br/> how many contacts touch him?</p>

    <p class="f4">"When a brother has so emerged<br/> from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling, house-father,<br/> three contacts touch him:<br/> the void,<br/> the signless<br/> and the aimless contact.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span>."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, sir,' said Citta, the house-father,<br/> pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But when one has so emerged<br/> from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling,<br/> how does a brother's mind tend,<br/> slope,<br/> incline?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"His mind tends to detachment,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> house-father,<br/> it slopes to detachment,<br/> it inclines to detachment."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said, sir,' said Citta, the house-father,<br/> pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br/> and welcomed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, sir, how many states<br/> are most useful<br/> for the attainment of the ceasing of perception and feeling?'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Indeed, house-father,<br/> you ask last<br/> what you ought to have asked first!</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet will I explain to you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Two states are most useful, house-father,<br/> for the attainment of the ceasing of perception and feeling, -<br/> calm and insight.'</p>
