    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> Nāṭa's Son, had come to Macchikasaṇḍa together with a great company of the Nigaṇṭhas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Citta, the house-father, heard it said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son, has come to Macchikasaṇḍa together with a great company of the Nigaṇṭhas.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So Citta, the house-father, with a number of followers, went to visit the Nigaṇṭha, Nāṭa's Son,<br/> and on coming to him greeted him in friendly wise,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br/> the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son, said to Citta, the house-father:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Hast thou faith, house-father,<br/> in the teaching of Gotama, the recluse,<br/> that there is a mental balance<br/> without thought directed and sustained,<br/> that there is a ceasing<br/> of thought directed and sustained?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Herein, sir, I do not walk with faith in the teaching<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of Gotama, the recluse,<br/> that there is a mental balance<br/> without thought directed and sustained,<br/> that there is a ceasing<br/> of thought directed and sustained.'</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words, the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son,<br/> looking round<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> on his own company, said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I would have you look, sirs,<br/> how straight is this house-father Citta,<br/> how guileless<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is this house-father Citta,<br/> how ingenuous is this house-father Citta!</p>

    <p class="f4">Why, he who should think there can be any ceasing of thought directed and sustained,<br/> might think the mind could be caught in a net,<br/> or that Gangā's stream<br/> could be held back with his own fist!'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what think you sir?<br/> Which is the more excellent,<br/> knowledge or faith?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Why, house-father,<br/> knowledge is more excellent than faith.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'Now I, sir, if I so desire,<br/> aloof from lusts,<br/> aloof from states that are evil,<br/> can enter upon the first trance,<br/> which is joined with thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of solitude,<br/> zestful and easeful,<br/> and can abide therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br/> by the calming down of thought directed and sustained<br/> ... can enter on the second trance and abide therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br/> by abandoning ease<br/> ... can enter on the fourth trance and abide therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus knowing, sir,<br/> thus seeing,<br/> believing what other recluse or brahmin,<br/> should I hold<br/> that there is a mental balance<br/> without thought directed and sustained,<br/> or that there is a ceasing of thought directed and sustained?'</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words,<br/> the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son,<br/> looking around on his company, said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I would have you look, sirs,<br/> how crooked is this house-father,<br/> how crafty,<br/> how counterfeiting is this house-father Citta!'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, indeed, sir, we understand your saying:<br/> "I would have ye look, sirs,<br/> how straight is this house-father Citta,<br/> how guileless,<br/> how honest is this house-father Citta."</p>

    <p class="f4">And now indeed we understand your saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I would have ye look, sirs,<br/> how crooked is this house-father Citta,<br/> how crafty,<br/> how dishonest is this house-father Citta."</p>

    <p class="f4">If, sir, your first assertion was true,<br/> your last was false.<br/> And if your last was true,<br/> your first was false.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now here, sir,<br/> these ten reasonable questions<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> arise.</p>

    <p class="f4">If you know the way to <span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span> reply to them,<br/> you should give me a counter-blow<br/> along with your company.</p>

    <p class="f4">One question,<br/> one explanation,<br/> one answer.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> Two questions,<br/> two explanations,<br/> two answers.<br/> Three<br/> Four<br/> Five<br/> Six<br/> Seven<br/> Eight<br/> Nine<br/> Ten questions,<br/> ten explanations,<br/> ten answers.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Citta, the house-father,<br/> getting no reply to these ten reasonable questions,<br/> rose up from his seat and went away.</p>
