    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time Kassapa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Unclothed,<br/> an old family friend,<br/> had come to Macchikasaṇḍa.</p>

    <p class="f4">And Citta, the house-father, heard it said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"They say our old family friend, Kassapa, the Unclothed,<br/> has come to Macchikasaṇḍa.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So Citta, the house-father, went to visit Kassapa, the Unclothed,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him in friendly wise,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the house-father, said to Kassapa, the Unclothed:</p>

    <p class="f4">"How long have you been a Wanderer, worthy Kassapa?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Full thirty years, house-father,<br/> have I been a Wanderer."</p>

    <p class="f4">"In those thirty years, sir,<br/> have you come by any superhuman experience,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> any truly Ariyan excellence of knowledge and insight,<br/> any comfortable life?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"In these full thirty years, house-father,<br/> that I have been a Wanderer,<br/> I have never come by any superhuman experience,<br/> nor any truly Ariyan excellence of knowledge and insight,<br/> nor any comfortable life, -<br/> nothing but nakedness<br/> and a shaven crown<br/> and dusting away the gravel."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[209]</b></span> At these words Citta, the house-father,<br/> said to Kassapa, the Unclothed: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"A strange thing indeed!</p>

    <p class="f4">A wonder indeed,<br/> the good teaching of the Norm!</p>

    <p class="f4">To think that in full thirty years<br/> one should come by no superhuman experience,<br/> no truly Ariyan excellence of knowledge and insight,<br/> nor any comfortable life, -<br/> nothing but nakedness<br/> and a shaven crown<br/> and dusting away the gravel!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"But you, house-father, -<br/> how long is it since you entered<br/> on the life of the disciple?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I too, sir, have been full thirty years a disciple."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But in those full thirty years, house-father,<br/> have you come by any superhuman experience,<br/> any truly Ariyan excellence of knowledge and insight,<br/> any comfortable life?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"How should it not be so, sir?</p>

    <p class="f4">I, sir, when I so desire,<br/> aloof from lust,<br/> aloof from states that are evil,<br/> can enter upon the first trance,<br/> which is joined with thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of solitude,<br/> zestful and easeful,<br/> and abide therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, sir, when I so desire,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/> by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/> entering on the inward calm,<br/> that single-mindedness of will,<br/> apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of mental balance,<br/> zestful and full of ease,<br/> can enter on the second trance<br/> and abide therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br/> by the fading out of zest<br/> become balanced and remain mindful and composed,<br/> and experiencing with the body<br/> the happiness of which the Arians aver:<br/> 'The balanced thoughtful man dwells happily'<br/> can enter on the third trance<br/> and abide therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br/> by rejecting pleasure and pain,<br/> by the coming to an end<br/> of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br/> can enter on the fourth trance<br/> and abide therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why, sir, if I should make an end<br/> earlier than the Exalted One,<br/> 'twere no wonder if the Exalted One<br/> should pronounce thus of me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is no fetter,<br/> bound by which Citta, the house-father,<br/> could come back again to this world.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Kassapa, the Unclothed,<br/> said to Citta, the house-father: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"A strange thing, indeed!<br/> A wonder, indeed,<br/> the good teaching of the Norm!</p>

    <p class="f4">To think that a householder,<br/> one who wears white clothes,<br/> should come to such superhuman experience,<br/> such truly Ariyan excellence of knowledge and wisdom,<br/> such comfortable living.</p>

    <p class="f4">Oh, house-father,<br/> may I get ordination in this Norm-discipline?</p>

    <p class="f4">May I get full ordination?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the house-father, took Kassapa, the Unclothed <span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span> ,<br/> to some elder brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">And on coming to them he said: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sirs, this is Kassapa, the Unclothed,<br/> an old family friend of ours.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let the elders ordain this man.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let them give him full ordination.</p>

    <p class="f4">I for my part<br/> will do my best<br/> to supply the requisites of robes,<br/> alms<br/> and lodging,<br/> and comforts and medicines in time of sickness."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">So Kassapa, the Unclothed, got ordination in the Norcā-diseipline,<br/> got full ordination.</p>

    <p class="f4">And not long after he was ordained<br/> did the venerable Kassapa,<br/> dwelling solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> in no<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> long time<br/> attain that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br/> to win which the clansmen<br/> rightly go forth from home to the homeless.</p>

    <p class="f4">So that in that very life,<br/> of himself,<br/> he fully understood it,<br/> realized it<br/> and abode therein,<br/> and knew:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the venerable Kassapa<br/> was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
