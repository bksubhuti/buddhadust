    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time Citta, the house-father, was sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> stricken with a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of devas that dwell in gardens,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> forest<br/> and trees,<br/> devas that dwell in healing herbs<br/> and forest trees,<br/> gathered and came together<br/> and said to Citta, the house-father: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Aspire thus, house-father:</p>

    <p class="f4">'In future time may I be a rajah,<br/> a world-ruler.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Citta, the house-father, replied to those devas that dwell in gardens,<br/> forest<br/> and trees,<br/> devas that dwell in healing herbs<br/> and forest trees:</p>

    <p class="f4">"That is a thing impermanent,<br/> that is a thing unstable,<br/> that must pass<br/> and be left behind."</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words<br/> the comrades and blood-relations of Citta, the house-father,<br/> said to him: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Set up mindfulness, good master!</p>

    <p class="f4">Talk not at random."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span> "What have I said<br/> that makes you tell me<br/> to set up mindfulness<br/> and talk not at random?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, good master, you said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is a thing impermanent,<br/> that is a thing unstable,<br/> that must pass<br/> and be left behind.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, but I said that<br/> to the devas that dwell in gardens,<br/> forest<br/> and trees,<br/> devas that dwell in healing herbs<br/> and forest trees, who said to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Aspire thus, house-father:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In future time may I be a rajah,<br/> a world-ruler."'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"What significance, house-father,<br/> did the devas that dwell in gardens,<br/> forest<br/> and trees,<br/> devas that dwell in healing herbs<br/> and forest trees see,<br/> so as to say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Aspire thus, house-father:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In future time may I be a rajah,<br/> a world-ruler."'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Those devas that dwell in gardens,<br/> forest<br/> and trees,<br/> devas that dwell in healing herbs<br/> and forest trees<br/> thought thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This Citta, the house-father,<br/> is a virtuous man,<br/> of a lovely nature.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he aspire to be in future time a rajah,<br/> a world-ruler,<br/> the righteous aspiration of the heart,<br/> righteous in its very purity,<br/> will prove a blessing to the virtuous man,<br/> will bring forth righteous fruit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seeing such significance<br/> did those that dwell in gardens,<br/> forest<br/> and trees,<br/> devas that dwell in healing herbs<br/> and forest trees say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Aspire thus, house-father:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In future time may I be a rajah,<br/> a world-ruler."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then I said to them:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That is a thing impermanent,<br/> that is a thing unstable,<br/> that must pass<br/> and be left behind.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, good master, do you instruct us."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wherefore thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Possessed of faith unfaltering in the Buddha will we be,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Tis he,<br/> that Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> the Fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> world knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="f4">Possessed of faith unfaltering in the Norm<br/> will we be,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/> a thing to be seen in this very life,<br/> not a thing of time,<br/> inviting to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be realized by them that are wise,<br/> each for himself."</p>

    <p class="f4">Possessed will we be of faith unfaltering in the Order,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Walking righteously<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br/> walking in the right way<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br/> to wit,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men, <span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span><br/> that is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br/> worthy of honour,<br/> worthy of respect,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy to be saluted with uplifted palms,<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever worthy offering there be in our clan,<br/> all that shall be imparted without favour<br/> to righteous ones<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> that are of lovely nature."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus must ye train yourselves."</p>

    <p class="f4">So, when he had inclined the hearts<br/> of his comrades and blood-relations<br/> towards the Buddha,<br/> the Norm<br/> and the Order,<br/> when he had established them<br/> in giving up, Citta,<br/> the house-father, made an end.</p>
