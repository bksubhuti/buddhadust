    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at Jeta Grove<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Wrathful, the headman, came to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him,<br/> he saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Wrathful, the headman, said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, what is the reason,<br/> what is the cause,<br/> why such and such an one<br/> is styled 'wrathful,'<br/> and what the reason,<br/> what the cause<br/> why such and such an one<br/> is styled 'kindly'?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, headman, a certain man's<br/> passion is not abandoned.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to that<br/> others harass him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Harassed by others<br/> he shows vexation.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is he styled 'wrathful.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Resentment is not abandoned.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to that<br/> others harass him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Harassed by others<br/> he shows vexation.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is he styled 'wrathful.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Illusion is not abandoned.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to that<br/> others harass him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Harassed by others<br/> he shows vexation.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is he styled 'wrathful.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That, headman, is the reason,<br/> that is the cause<br/> why such and such an one<br/> is styled 'wrathful.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein, headman, if a certain man's<br/> passion is abandoned,<br/> owing to that<br/> others do not harass him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Unharassed by others<br/> he shows no vexation.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is he styled 'kindly.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Resentment is abandoned.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to that others do not <span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span> harass him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Unharassed by others<br/> he shows no vexation.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is styled 'kindly.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If illusion be abandoned,<br/> others do not harass him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Unharassed by others<br/> he shows no vexation.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is he styled 'kindly.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the reason,<br/> that is the cause, headman,<br/> why a certain one is styled 'kindly.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Wrathful, the headman,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Excellent, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br/> or show forth what is hidden,<br/> or point the way to him that wanders astray,<br/> or hold up a light in the darkness<br/> that they who have eyes<br/> may behold objects, -<br/> even as in divers ways<br/> has the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">To the Exalted One, lord,<br/> I go for refuge,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br/> as a lay disciple,<br/> as one who has gone to him for refuge,<br/> from this day forth<br/> so long as life doth last."</p>
