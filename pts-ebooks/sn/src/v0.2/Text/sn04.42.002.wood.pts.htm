    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha,<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then Tālaputa, the stage-manager,<br/> came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Tālapuṭa, the stage-manager,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br/> of teachers of old<br/> who were actors,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Speaking of stage-players they said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A player who on the stage<br/> or in the arena<br/> makes people laugh<br/> and delights them<br/> by his counterfeiting of the truth,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death is reborn in the <span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span> company of the Laughing Devas.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What says the Exalted One in this matter?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough, manager!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a second time did Tālapuṭa, the stage-manager,<br/> say to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br/> of teachers of old<br/> who were actors,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Speaking of stage-players they said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A player who on the stage<br/> or in the arena<br/> makes people laugh<br/> and delights them<br/> by his counterfeiting of the truth,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death is reborn in the company of the Laughing Devas.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What says the Exalted One in this matter?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a second time did the Exalted One respond:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough, manager!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a third time did Tālapuṭa, the stage-manager,<br/> say to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br/> of teachers of old<br/> who were actors,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Speaking of stage-players they said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A player who on the stage<br/> or in the arena<br/> makes people laugh<br/> and delights them<br/> by his counterfeiting of the truth,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death is reborn in the company of the Laughing Devas.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What says the Exalted One in this matter?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"True it is<br/> I did not permit your question,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Enough, manager!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ask me not this question.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Nevertheless I will expound this thing to you.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of those beings, manager,<br/> who aforetime were not free from lusts,<br/> but were bound with the bond of lust -<br/> in such cases,<br/> a player<br/> who on the stage<br/> or in the arena<br/> brings about lustful states of mind,<br/> so that such beings become still more lustful;</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of those beings, manager,<br/> who aforetime were not free from resentment,<br/> but were bound with the bond of resentment -<br/> in such cases,<br/> a player<br/> who on the stage<br/> or in the arena<br/> brings about resentful states of mind,<br/> so that such beings become still more resentful;</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of those beings, manager,<br/> who aforetime were not free from illusion,<br/> but were bound with the bond of illusion -<br/> in such cases,<br/> a player<br/> who on the stage<br/> or in the arena<br/> brings about illusory states of mind,<br/> so that such beings become still more deluded;</p>

    <p class="f4">being himself drugged and slothful,<br/> he drugs and makes others slothful, -<br/> such an one,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death is reborn in the Purgatory of Laughter.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now if his view of the matter is as you say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whatsoever player on the stage<br/> or in the arena<br/> makes people laugh<br/> and delights them<br/> by his counterfeiting of the truth,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death is reborn in the company of the Laughing Devas,'</p>

    <p class="f4">then I declare his view is perverted.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, manager, I declare<br/> that for one who is guilty of perverted view<br/> there are two paths open,<br/> one is Purgatory<br/> and the other is rebirth as an animal."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">At these words, Tālapuṭa, the stage-manager,<br/> cried aloud<br/> and burst into tears.</p>

    <p class="f4">[Then said the Exalted One: -]</p>

    <p class="f4">"That was why I disallowed your question, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Enough, manager!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ask me not this question.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span> "But, lord, I am not lamenting for that.</p>

    <p class="f4">I lament at the thought<br/> that for many a long day<br/> I have been cheated,<br/> deceived<br/> and led astray<br/> by teacher after teacher,<br/> actors,<br/> in the belief that a player on the stage<br/> or in the arena<br/> makes people laugh<br/> and delights them<br/> by his counterfeiting of the truth,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death is reborn in the company of the Laughing Devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br/> or show forth what is hidden,<br/> or point out the way<br/> to him that wanders astray,<br/> or hold up a light in the darkness<br/> so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br/> even so in divers ways<br/> has the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">To the Exalted One I go for refuge,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">O that I might gain ordination from the Exalted One,<br/> that I might gain full ordination."</p>

    <p class="f4">So Tālapuṭa, the stage-manager,<br/> got ordination from the Exalted One,<br/> got full ordination.</p>

    <p class="f4">And not long after doing so<br/> the venerable Tālapuṭa,<br/> dwelling solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> in no long time<br/> attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br/> to win which<br/> the clansmen rightly go forth from home<br/> to the homeless.</p>

    <p class="f4">So that in that very life,<br/> of himself,<br/> he fully understood it,<br/> realized it<br/> and abode therein,<br/> and knew:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Tālapuṭa, was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
