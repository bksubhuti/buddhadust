    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha,<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Mahout,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the head keeper, came to see the Exalted One<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side, Mahout, the head keeper,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br/> of teachers of old<br/> who were mahouts:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A mahout who in battle exerts himself,<br/> puts forth effort,<br/> thus exerting himself<br/> and putting forth effort<br/> is tortured<br/> and put an end to by others.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br/> after death he is reborn<br/> in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What says the Exalted One of this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough, head keeper!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a second time Mahout, the head keeper,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br/> of teachers of old<br/> who were mahouts:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A mahout who in battle exerts himself,<br/> puts forth effort,<br/> thus exerting himself<br/> and putting forth effort<br/> is tortured<br/> and put an end to by others.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br/> after death he is reborn<br/> in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What says the Exalted One of this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough, head keeper!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a third time Mahout, the head keeper,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br/> of teachers of old<br/> who were mahouts:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A mahout who in battle exerts himself,<br/> puts forth effort,<br/> thus exerting himself<br/> and putting forth effort<br/> is tortured<br/> and put an end to by others.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br/> after death he is reborn<br/> in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What says the Exalted One of this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"True it is, head keeper, that I do not admit your question, and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough, head keeper!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

    <p class="f4">Nevertheless I will expound it to you.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the case of a mahout<br/> who in battle exerts himself,<br/> puts forth effort,<br/> he must previously have had this low,<br/> mean,<br/> perverse idea:</p>

    <p class="f4">Let those beings be tortured,<br/> be bound,<br/> be destroyed,<br/> be exterminated,<br/> so that they may be thought never to have existed."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, so exerting himself,<br/> so putting forth effort,<br/> other men torture him<br/> and make an end of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">When body breaks up,<br/> after death he is reborn<br/> in the Purgatory of Quarrels.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now if his view was this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A mahout who in battle exerts himself,<br/> puts forth effort,<br/> thus exerting himself<br/> and putting forth effort<br/> is tortured<br/> and put an end to by others.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br/> after death he is reborn<br/> in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight,'</p>

    <p class="f4">- then I say that view of his is perverted.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, head keeper, I declare<br/> that for one who is guilty of perverted view<br/> one of two paths is open,<br/> either purgatory<br/> or rebirth as an animal."</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Mahout, the head keeper,<br/> cried aloud<br/> and burst into tears.</p>

    <p class="f4">[Then said the Exalted One: -]</p>

    <p class="f4">"That was why I disallowed your question,<br/> head keeper,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Enough, head keeper!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ask me not this question.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, lord, I am not lamenting for that,<br/> but at the thought that<br/> for many a long day<br/> I have been cheated,<br/> deceived<br/> and led astray<br/> in the past by teacher after teacher,<br/> mahouts,<br/> in the belief that any mahout who in battle exerts himself,<br/> puts forth effort,<br/> thus exerting himself<br/> and putting forth effort<br/> is tortured<br/> and put an end to by others.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br/> after death he is reborn<br/> in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br/> or show forth what is hidden,<br/> or point out the way<br/> to him that wanders astray,<br/> or hold up a light in the darkness<br/> so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br/> even so in divers ways<br/> has the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge, to the Norm and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br/> as a lay disciple,<br/> as one who has gone to him for refuge,<br/> from this day forth<br/> so long as life doth last."</p>
