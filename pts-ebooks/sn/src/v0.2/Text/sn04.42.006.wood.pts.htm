    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Nalanda<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in Pāvārika Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Asibandhaka's Son,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> the headman,<br/> came to see the Exalted One and,<br/> on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, the brahmins of the west,<br/> who are carriers of water-pots,<br/> wearers of lily-garlands,<br/> purifiers by water,<br/> fire-worshippers,<br/> when a man has died<br/> and made an end, -<br/> they lift him up<br/> and carry him out,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> call on him by name<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> and speed him heavenwards.</p>

    <p class="f4">But the Exalted One,<br/> who is Arahant,<br/> an All-enlightened One,<br/> is able to bring it about<br/> that the whole world,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> can be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World."</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to that, headman, I will question you.</p>

    <p class="f4">You may reply as you think fit.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose a case<br/> where a man is a taker of life,<br/> a taker of what is not <span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span> given,<br/> a wrong-doer in respect of sensual passion,<br/> a liar,<br/> a backbiter,<br/> of bitter speech,<br/> a babbler<br/> and covetous,<br/> of malevolent heart,<br/> of perverted view.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a great multitude gathers<br/> and throngs together,<br/> aspires and praises him<br/> and goes about with uplifted palms,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'May this man,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death be reborn<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray would that man,<br/> owing to the aspirations and praises<br/> of that great multitude,<br/> owing to their going about<br/> with uplifted palms, -<br/> would that man,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Again, headman, suppose a man hurls<br/> a huge, great rock<br/> into a deep,<br/> deep pool of water.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a great multitude gathers<br/> and throngs together<br/> and aspires<br/> and praises it<br/> and goes about with uplifted palms,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Rise up, good rock!</p>

    <p class="f4">Float up, good rock!</p>

    <p class="f4">Float ashore, good rock!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">Would that huge, great rock,<br/> because of the aspirations,<br/> because of the praises,<br/> because of the going about with uplifted palms<br/> of that great multitude, -<br/> would it rise up or float up or float ashore?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, headman,<br/> whatever man is a taker of life,<br/> a taker of what is not given,<br/> a wrong-doer in respect of sensual passion,<br/> a liar,<br/> a backbiter,<br/> of bitter speech,<br/> a babbler<br/> and covetous,<br/> of malevolent heart,<br/> of perverted view, -<br/> however much a great multitude,<br/> gathering and thronging together,<br/> might aspire<br/> and praise him<br/> and go about with uplifted palms,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'May this man, when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World,'</p>

    <p class="f4">yet would that man,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> be reborn in the Woeful Lot,<br/> in the Downfall,<br/> in Purgatory.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose that in this case<br/> in a man who abstains from taking life,<br/> who abstains from taking what is not given,<br/> who abstains from wrong action<br/> in respect of sensual passion,<br/> who abstains from lying,<br/> who abstains from back biting,<br/> who abstains from <span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span> bitter speech and babbling,<br/> who is not covetous,<br/> not of malevolent heart,<br/> a man of right view, -<br/> then a great multitude,<br/> gathering and thronging together,<br/> aspire<br/> and praise him<br/> and go about with uplifted palms,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'May this man, when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> be reborn in the Woeful Lot,<br/> in the Downfall,<br/> in Purgatory'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">Would that man,<br/> because of the aspirations<br/> and praises<br/> and going about with uplifted palms<br/> of that great multitude,<br/> be reborn in the Woeful Lot,<br/> in the Downfall,<br/> in Purgatory?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose again, headman,<br/> a man plunges a jar of butter<br/> or a jar of oil<br/> into a deep,<br/> deep pool of water,<br/> and breaks it,<br/> and it<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> becomes shreds<br/> or fragments<br/> and sinks down to the bottom:<br/> but the butter<br/> or oil<br/> that was in it<br/> floats up to the top.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then suppose a great multitude,<br/> gathering and thronging together,<br/> aspires<br/> and praises it,<br/> and goes about with uplifted palms,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sink down, good butter!</p>

    <p class="f4">Sink in, good butter!</p>

    <p class="f4">Go to the bottom,<br/> good butter and oil!"</p>

    <p class="f4">What think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">Would that butter and oil,<br/> because of the aspirations<br/> and praises<br/> and going about with uplifted palms<br/> of that great multitude, -<br/> would they sink down,<br/> would they sink in,<br/> would they go to the bottom?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, headman,<br/> whatever man abstains from taking life,<br/> who abstains from taking what is not given,<br/> who abstains from wrong action<br/> in respect of sensual passion,<br/> who abstains from lying,<br/> who abstains from back biting,<br/> who abstains from bitter speech and babbling,<br/> who is not covetous,<br/> not of malevolent heart,<br/> a man of right view,<br/> however much a great multitude,<br/> gathering and thronging together,<br/> aspire<br/> and praise him<br/> and go about with uplifted palms,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'May this man, when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> be reborn in the Woeful Lot,<br/> in the Downfall,<br/> in Purgatory',</p>

    <p class="f4">yet would he be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World."</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br/> or show forth what is hidden,<br/> or point out the way<br/> to him that wanders astray,<br/> or hold up a light in the darkness<br/> so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br/> even so in divers ways<br/> has the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge, to the Norm and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br/> as a lay disciple,<br/> as one who has gone to him for refuge,<br/> from this day forth<br/> so long as life doth last."</p>
