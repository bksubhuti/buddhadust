    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Nalanda in Pāvārika Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br/> came to see <span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span> the Exalted One and,<br/> on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does not the Exalted One, lord,<br/> dwell in compassion for every living thing?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, headman, the Tathāgata,<br/> dwells in compassion for every living thing."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, lord, does the Exalted One<br/> teach the Norm in full<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> to certain ones,<br/> but to certain others<br/> he does not teach the Norm in full?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, headman, as to this<br/> I shall question you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you reply as you think fit.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose a yeoman farmer<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> here<br/> has three fields,<br/> one excellent,<br/> one moderate,<br/> and one poor,<br/> hard,<br/> saltish,<br/> of bad soil</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">When that yeoman farmer wants to sow his seed,<br/> which field would he sow first,<br/> the excellent field,<br/> the moderate field,<br/> or the one that is poor,<br/> hard,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> saltish,<br/> of bad soil?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"That yeoman farmer, lord,<br/> wishing to sow his seed,<br/> would first sow the excellent field,<br/> and having done so<br/> he would sow the moderate one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having so done<br/> he might and might not sow that field<br/> that is poor,<br/> hard,<br/> saltish,<br/> of bad soil.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because in any case<br/> it might do for cattle-food."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, headman, just like that excellent field<br/> are my ordained disciples,<br/> both men and women.</p>

    <p class="f4">I teach them the Norm<br/> that is lovely in its beginning,<br/> lovely in its middle<br/> and lovely in its ending,<br/> both in spirit and in letter.</p>

    <p class="f4">I make known to them<br/> the righteous life<br/> that is wholly perfect<br/> and utterly pure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, headman,<br/> these people abide with me for their island,<br/> with me for their cave of shelter,<br/> me for their stronghold,<br/> me for their refuge.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, headman,<br/> just like that moderate field<br/> are my lay-disciples,<br/> both men and women.</p>

    <p class="f4">I teach them the Norm<br/> that is lovely in its beginning,<br/> lovely in its middle<br/> and lovely in its ending,<br/> both in spirit and in letter.</p>

    <p class="f4">I make known <span class="f2 g"><b>[222]</b></span> to them<br/> the righteous life<br/> that is wholly perfect<br/> and utterly pure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, headman,<br/> these people abide with me for their island,<br/> with me for their cave of shelter,<br/> me for their stronghold,<br/> me for their refuge.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, headman,<br/> just like that field that is poor,<br/> hard,<br/> saltish,<br/> of bad soil,<br/> are my<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> wandering recluses and brahmins<br/> that hold other views than mine.</p>

    <p class="f4">To them also I teach the Norm<br/> that is lovely in its beginning,<br/> lovely in its middle<br/> and lovely in its ending,<br/> both in spirit and in letter.</p>

    <p class="f4">I make known to them<br/> the righteous life<br/> that is wholly perfect<br/> and utterly pure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because if so be they understand<br/> but a single sentence of it,<br/> that would be to their profit and happiness<br/> for many a long day.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, headman,<br/> suppose a man has three water-pots,<br/> one not cracked,<br/> not leaky,<br/> not letting (water) run to waste -<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> and one water pot not cracked,<br/> but leaky<br/> and letting water run to waste:<br/> and one water-pot that is both cracked and leaky,<br/> and letting water run to waste.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">If that man wants to store up water,<br/> which pot would he put it in first, -<br/> in the one that is not cracked,<br/> not leaky,<br/> not letting water run to waste?</p>

    <p class="f4">Or would he put it in the pot<br/> that is not cracked,<br/> but leaky,<br/> letting water run to waste?</p>

    <p class="f4">Or would he put it in the one<br/> that is both cracked and leaky,<br/> and letting water run to waste?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, lord, that man would first store his water -<br/> in the one that is not cracked,<br/> not leaky,<br/> not letting water run to waste,<br/> then in the pot<br/> that is not cracked,<br/> but leaky,<br/> letting water run to waste, and as to the one<br/> that is both cracked and leaky,<br/> and letting water run to waste<br/> he might or he might not put it in that.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">At any rate the water<br/> might do for washing pots."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, brahmin, just like that water-pot<br/> that is not cracked,<br/> not leaky,<br/> not letting water run to waste<br/> are my ordained disciples,<br/> both men and women.</p>

    <p class="f4">I teach them the Norm<br/> that is lovely in its beginning,<br/> lovely in its middle<br/> and lovely in its ending,<br/> both in spirit and in letter.</p>

    <p class="f4">I make known to them<br/> the righteous life<br/> that is wholly perfect<br/> and utterly pure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, headman,<br/> these people abide with me <span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span> for their island,<br/> with me for their cave of shelter,<br/> me for their stronghold,<br/> me for their refuge.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, headman, just like that pot that is not cracked,<br/> but leaky,<br/> letting water run to waste<br/> are my lay-disciples<br/> both men and women.</p>

    <p class="f4">I teach them the Norm<br/> that is lovely in its beginning,<br/> lovely in its middle<br/> and lovely in its ending,<br/> both in spirit and in letter.</p>

    <p class="f4">I make known to them<br/> the righteous life<br/> that is wholly perfect<br/> and utterly pure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, headman,<br/> these people abide with me for their island,<br/> with me for their cave of shelter,<br/> me for their stronghold,<br/> me for their refuge.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, headman,<br/> just like that water-pot<br/> that is both cracked and leaky,<br/> and letting water run to waste,<br/> are mv wandering recluses and brahmins<br/> that hold other views than mine.</p>

    <p class="f4">I teach them the Norm<br/> that is lovely in its beginning,<br/> lovely in its middle<br/> and lovely in its ending,<br/> both in spirit and in letter.</p>

    <p class="f4">Because if so be they understand<br/> but a single sentence of it,<br/> that would be to their profit and happiness<br/> for many a long day.</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Asibandhaka's Son<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br/> or show forth what is hidden,<br/> or point out the way<br/> to him that wanders astray,<br/> or hold up a light in the darkness<br/> so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br/> even so in divers ways<br/> has the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge, to the Norm and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br/> as a lay disciple,<br/> as one who has gone to him for refuge,<br/> from this day forth<br/> so long as life doth last."</p>
