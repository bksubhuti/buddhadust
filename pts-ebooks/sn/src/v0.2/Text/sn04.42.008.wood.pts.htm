    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Nalanda in Pāvārika Mango Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br/> a follower of the Unclothed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> came to see the Exalted One and,<br/> on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br/> the Exalted One said to him: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Headman, in what way does the Unclothed, Nata's Son,<br/> teach doctrine to his followers?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus, lord, does the Unclothed, Nata's Son,<br/> teach doctrine to his followers:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whosoever slays a living creature, -<br/> all such go to the Woeful Lot,<br/> to Purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever takes what is not given, -<br/> all such go to the Woeful Lot,<br/> to Purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever acts wrongly in respect of sensual <span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span> passion, -<br/> all such go to the Woeful Lot,<br/> to Purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever tells lies, -<br/> all such go to the Woeful Lot,<br/> to Purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">According as a man habitually<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> lives,<br/> so goes he forth<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> to his destiny.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That, lord, is how the Unclothed, Nata's Son,<br/> teaches doctrine to his followers."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But you say, headman:</p>

    <p class="f4">'According as a man habitually lives,<br/> so goes he forth to his destiny.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That being so,<br/> no one will go to the Woeful Lot,<br/> to Purgatory,<br/> according to the teaching<br/> of the Unclothed, Nāṭa's Son.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">If a man takes life by night<br/> or by day<br/> or from time to time,<br/> which of the three times<br/> is the most habitual to him,<br/> that in which he slays<br/> or that in which he slays not?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, lord, of course<br/> in such case<br/> the time during which he is not slaying<br/> is the more habitual to him."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But you say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'According as a man habitually lives,<br/> so goes he forth to his destiny.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This being so, no man at all<br/> goes to the Woeful Lot,<br/> to Purgatory,<br/> according to the teaching<br/> of the Unclothed, Nāṭa's Son.</p>

    <p class="f4">If a man takes what is not given by night<br/> or by day<br/> or from time to time,<br/> which of the three times<br/> is the most habitual to him,<br/> that in which he is stealing<br/> or that in which he is not stealing?"</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">If a man be a liar by night<br/> or by day<br/> or from time to time,<br/> which of the three times<br/> is the most habitual to him,<br/> that in which he is telling lies<br/> or that in which he is not telling lies?"</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein, headman,<br/> if a certain teacher teaches such doctrine as this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whosoever slays a living creature, -<br/> all such go to the Woeful Lot,<br/> to Purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever takes what is not given, -<br/> all such go to the Woeful Lot,<br/> to Purgatory.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever tells lies, -<br/> all such go to the Woeful Lot,<br/> to Purgatory.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">His follower has faith in his teacher.</p>

    <p class="f4">He thinks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My teacher teaches this doctrine,<br/> holds this view:</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein, headman, the Tathāgata, arises in the world,<br/> the Arahant,<br/> the Fully Enlightened One,<br/> the Happy One,<br/> the Charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> Teacher of Devas and mankind,<br/> the Buddha,<br/> the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">He censures,<br/> strongly censures<br/> taking life,<br/> saying:</p>
