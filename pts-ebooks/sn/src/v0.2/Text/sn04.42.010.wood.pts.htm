    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time in the royal palace<br/> among those of the royal retinue<br/> who sat together in conclave<br/> there arose this topic in casual talk:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br/> are permitted to take gold and silver,<br/> they let gold and silver be offered,<br/> the recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br/> accept gold and silver."</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/> there sat in that company<br/> Jewel-crested,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the headman.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the headman:</p>

    <p class="f4">"My good sirs, say not that!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is not permitted to the recluses<br/> who are the sons of the Sakyan<br/> to take gold and silver,<br/> to let gold and silver be offered,<br/> to accept gold and silver.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejected by them<br/> are gems<br/> and gold,<br/> they have done with gold and silver.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Howbeit, Jewel-crested, the headman,<br/> could not convince that company.</p>

    <p class="f4">So Jewel-crested, the headman,<br/> went to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> Jewel-crested, the headman, said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, in the royal palace here,<br/> when those of the royal retinue<br/> had gathered and were sitting in conclave,<br/> this topic of casual talk arose:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br/> are permitted to take gold and silver,<br/> they let gold and silver be offered,<br/> the recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br/> accept gold and silver.'</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words, lord,<br/> I said to that company:</p>

    <p class="f4">'0 my good sirs,<br/> say not that!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is not so.</p>

    <p class="f4">The recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br/> do not take gold and silver,<br/> do not permit the offering of gold and silver,<br/> do not accept gold and silver.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejected by them are gems and gold.</p>

    <p class="f4">They have done with gold and silver.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But, lord, I could not convince that company.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, in so explaining<br/> did I speak in accordance with the Exalted One's view,<br/> without misrepresenting the Exalted One<br/> by stating what is wrong?</p>

    <p class="f4">Did I answer in conformity<br/> with his teaching,<br/> so that no one who is of the same view,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> a follower of the Exalted One's view,<br/> could give opportunity for censure?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Truly, headman, in so explaining<br/> you did speak in accordance with my view.</p>

    <p class="f4">You did not misrepresent me<br/> by stating what is wrong.</p>

    <p class="f4">You did answer in conformity with my teaching,<br/> so that no one who is of my view,<br/> a follower of my view,<br/> could give opportunity for censure.</p>

    <p class="f4">No, indeed, headman!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is not permitted<br/> to the recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br/> to take gold and silver,<br/> to let it be offered,<br/> to accept gold and silver.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not take gold and silver,<br/> let gold and silver be offered,<br/> accept gold and silver.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejected by them are gems and gold.</p>

    <p class="f4">They have done with <span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span> gold and silver.</p>

    <p class="f4">To him, headman, who is permitted to take gold and silver,<br/> the five sensual delights are also permitted.</p>

    <p class="f4">You may downright aver, headman,<br/> of him to whom the taking of gold and silver is permitted<br/> that he is not a recluse by nature,<br/> not of the nature of the Sakyan's sons.</p>

    <p class="f4">However, headman, this do I declare:</p>

    <p class="f4">Grass<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> is to be sought for<br/> by those in need of grass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Firewood is to be sought for<br/> by those in need of firewood.</p>

    <p class="f4">A cart is to be sought for<br/> by those in need of a cart.</p>

    <p class="f4">A servant is to be sought for<br/> by him who is in need of a servant.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, headman, in no manner whatsoever<br/> do I declare that gold and silver should be accepted<br/> or sought for."</p>
