    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Mallas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> at Uruvelakappa, a township of the Mallas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Bhadragaka, the headman, came to visit the Exalted One. On coming to him he saluted him and sat down at one side. So seated Bhadragaka, the headman, said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One would teach me the arising and the coming to an end of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'If I were to teach you, headman, the arising and the coming to an end of Ill, beginning with past time, saying, "Thus it was in the past," you would have doubt and perplexity. And if, headman, I were to teach you the arising and the coming to an end of Ill, beginning with future time, saying, "So will it be in the future," you would likewise have doubt and perplexity. But sitting here and now, headman, with you sitting here also, I will teach you the arising and the coming to an end of Ill. Do you listen attentively. Apply your mind and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so, lord,' replied Bhadragaka to the Exalted One. <span class="f2 g"><b>[233]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what think you, headman? Are there any men in Uruvelakappa owing to whose death or imprisonment or loss or blame there would come upon you sorrow and suffering, woe, lamentation and despair?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'There are such men in Uruvelakappa, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'But, headman, are there any men in Uruvelakappa owing to whose death or imprisonment or loss or blame, no sorrow and suffering, no woe, lamentation and despair would come upon you?'</p>

    <p class="f4">There are such men in Uruvelakappa, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, headman, what is the reason, what is the cause why sorrow and suffering, owe, lamentation and despair would come upon you in respect of some, but not of the others?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'In the case of those, lord, owing to whose death or imprisonment or loss or blame I should suffer such sorrow ... it is because I have desire and longing for them. And in the case of the others, lord, because I have not such desire and longing.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"You say, "I have not such desire and longing for them." Now, headman, do you shape your course<span class="f3"><sup>3</sup></span> by this Norm, when you have seen and known it, when you have reached it without loss of time, — plunged into it both in respect of the past and of the future, thus: Whatsoever Ill arising has come upon me in the past, — all that is rooted in desire,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is joined to desire. Whatsoever Ill arising may come upon me in future time, — all that is rooted in desire, is joined to desire. Desire is the root of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Wonderful, lord! Strange it is, lord, how ell said is this saying of the Exalted One: "Whatsoever Ill arising comes upon me, — all that is rooted in desire. Desire is indeed the root of Ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, lord, there is my boy, — Ciravāsi is his name. He lodges away from here.<span class="f3"><sup>5</sup></span> At the time of rising up, lord, I send off a man, saying: "Go, my man, inquire of Ciravāsi." Then, lord, till that man comes back again, I am in an anxious state,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> fearing lest some sickness may have befallen Ciravāsi.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what think you, headman? Would sorrow and grief, woe, lamentation and despair come upon you if your boy Ciravāsi were slain or imprisoned or had loss or blame?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, if such were to befall my boy Ciravāsi, how should I not have sorrow and grief, woe, lamentation and despair?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'But, headman, you must regard it in this manner: "Whatsoever Ill arising comes upon me, — all that is rooted in desire, is joined to desire. Desire is indeed the root of Ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman? When you did not see, did not hear Ciravāsi's mother, did you feel desire or longing or affection for her?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'No indeed, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'But, headman, when you got sight of her, got hearing of her, did you then have desire or longing or affection for her?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yes, lord.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now what think you, headman? Would sorrow and grief ... come upon you if Ciravāsi's mother were slain or imprisoned or had any loss or blame?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Why surely, lord, sorrow and grief ... would come upon me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'So in this manner, headman, must you look upon it: Whatsoever Ill arising may come upon me, — all that is rooted in desire, is joined to desire. Desire is indeed the root of Ill.</p>
