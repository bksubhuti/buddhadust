    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Mallas at Uruvelakappa, a township of the Mallas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Rāsiya,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the headman, came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Rāsiya, the headman,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, that Gotama the recluse<br/> censures all ascetic ways,<br/> that he downright chides and abuses<br/> any ascetic who lives a rough life.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Those who say thus, lord, -</p>

    <p class="f4">that <span class="f2 g"><b>[235]</b></span> Gotama the recluse<br/> censures all ascetic ways,<br/> that he downright chides and abuses<br/> any ascetic who lives a rough life,</p>

    <p class="f4">do they speak in conformity with the Exalted One's view,<br/> without misrepresenting the Exalted One<br/> by stating what is wrong?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Do they speak in conformity with his teaching,<br/> so that no one who is of the same view,<br/> a follower of his view,<br/> could give opportunity for censure?</p>

    <p class="f4">"They who speak thus, headman,<br/> saying</p>

    <p class="f4">that Gotama the recluse<br/> censures all ascetic ways,<br/> that he downright chides and abuses<br/> any ascetic who lives a rough life,-</p>

    <p class="f4">such speak not in accordance with my view,<br/> such do misrepresent me<br/> in so saying what is wrong.</p>

    <h4 class="ctr sigil_not_in_toc">1.</h4>

    <p class="f4">These two extremes,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> headman,<br/> should not be followed<br/> by one who has gone forth from the world:</p>

    <p class="f4">and devotion to self-mortification,<br/> which is painful,<br/> not Ariyan,<br/> not bound up with welfare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not following after these two extremes, headman,<br/> is the Middle Way of approach,<br/> fully known by the Tathāgata,<br/> which giveth vision,<br/> giveth knowledge,<br/> leading to calm,<br/> to supernormal knowledge,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what,headman,<br/> is that Middle Way of approach,<br/> fully known by the Tathāgata,<br/> which giveth vision,<br/> giveth knowledge,<br/> leading to calm,<br/> to supernormal knowledge,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are these three things, headman,<br/> belonging to this life,<br/> that are undecaying,<br/> not subject to time,<br/> inviting to come and see,<br/> leading onward (to Nibbāna),<br/> to be realized each for himself<br/> by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr">(i)</p>

    <p class="f4">Since the lustful man,<br/> because of his lust,<br/> directs thought to his own harm,<br/> directs thought to the harm of others,<br/> to the harm both of himself and of others,<br/> but when lust is abandoned<br/> directs thought neither to his own harm<br/> nor to that of others,<br/> nor of both, -<br/> thus these (results) belong to this life,<br/> they are undecaying,<br/> not subject to time,<br/> inviting to come and see,<br/> leading onward (to Nibbāna),<br/> to be realized each for himself<br/> by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr">(ii)</p>

    <p class="f4">Since the depraved man,<br/> because of his depravity,<br/> directs thought to his own harm,<br/> directs thought to the harm of others,<br/> to the harm both of himself and of others,<br/> but when depravity is abandoned<br/> directs thought neither to his own harm<br/> nor to that of others,<br/> nor of both, -<br/> thus these (results) belong to this life,<br/> they are undecaying,<br/> not subject to time,<br/> inviting to come and see,<br/> leading onward (to Nibbāna),<br/> to be realized each for himself<br/> by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr">(iii)</p>

    <p class="f4">Since the deluded man,<br/> because of his delusion,<br/> directs thought to his own harm,<br/> directs thought to the harm of others,<br/> to the harm both of himself and of others,<br/> but when delusion is abandoned<br/> directs thought neither to his own harm<br/> nor to that of others,<br/> nor of both, -<br/> thus these (results) belong to this life,<br/> they are undecaying,<br/> not subject to time,<br/> inviting to come and see,<br/> leading onward (to Nibbāna),<br/> to be realized each for himself<br/> by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, headman, are the three things<br/> belonging to this life,<br/> that are undecaying,<br/> not subject to time,<br/> inviting to come and see,<br/> leading onward (to Nibbāna), to be realized each for himself<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Rāsiya, the headman<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br/> or show forth what is hidden,<br/> or point out the way<br/> to him that wanders astray,<br/> or hold up a light in the darkness<br/> so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br/> even so in divers ways<br/> has the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge, to the Norm and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br/> as a lay disciple,<br/> as one who has gone to him for refuge,<br/> from this day forth<br/> so long as life doth last."</p>
