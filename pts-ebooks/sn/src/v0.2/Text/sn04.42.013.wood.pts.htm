    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Koliyans<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> at Uttara,<br/> a township of the Koliyans.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Pāṭaliya, the headman, came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated Pāṭaliya, the headman,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I have heard it said, lord,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Gotama the recluse knows magic.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Those who thus aver, lord,<br/> that Gotama the recluse knows magic, -<br/> do they speak in accordance with the Exalted One's view,<br/> without misrepresenting the Exalted One<br/> by stating what is wrong?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do they speak in conformity with his teaching,<br/> so that no one who is of the same view,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> a follower of his view,<br/> could give opportunity for censure?</p>

    <p class="f4">We wish not to speak falsely of the Exalted One, lord."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"They who said thus, headman,<br/> that I know magic,<br/> do speak in accordance with my view.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not misrepresent me<br/> by stating what is wrong.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do speak in conformity with my teaching,<br/> so that no one who is of the same view as I,<br/> who is a follower of my view,<br/> could give opportunity for censure."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"So then it is true, my friend,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> though I did not believe those recluses and brahmins<br/> when they said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Gotama the recluse knows magic.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So after all,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> my friend, Gotama the recluse<br/> is a trickster."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, headman, does he who says that I know magic, -<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[245]</b></span> does he in so saying<br/> thereby imply that I am a trickster,<br/> saying,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Such is the Exalted One,<br/> such is the Happy One'?</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, headman, in this matter<br/> I will question you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you answer as you think fit.</p>

    <h4 class="ctr sigil_not_in_toc">1.</h4>

    <p class="f4 ctr">(i)</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you know the hirelings of the Koliyans,<br/> who have drooping crests?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord, I do know them."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">For what purpose<br/> are these hirelings of the Koliyans,<br/> who have drooping crests?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"To check robbers, lord,<br/> among the Koliyans<br/> and to carry messages for the Koliyans.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, lord, is the reason<br/> for those hirelings of the Koliyans,<br/> who have drooping crests."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now what think you, headman?</p>

    <p class="f4">As to those hirelings of the Koliyans,<br/> do you know them as honest<br/> or as rogues?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I know them, lord, as wicked rogues.</p>

    <p class="f4">If there be any wicked rogues<br/> among the Koliyans,<br/> it is they."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, headman, if anyone should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Pāṭaliya, the headman,<br/> knows that the hirelings of the Koliyans,<br/> who have drooping crests,<br/> are wicked rogues.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore Pataliya, the headman,<br/> is himself a wicked rogue,' -</p>

    <p class="f4">would he be speaking truth in so saying?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">The hirelings of the Koliyans<br/> are one thing,<br/> but I am quite another thing,<br/> of quite another nature<br/> from that of the Koliyans' hirelings<br/> who have drooping crests,<br/> of quite another nature!"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"So, headman, you will get<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> this said about you:</p>

    <p class="f4">'<i>Pāṭaliya,</i> the headman, knows<br/> that the Koliyans' hirelings with drooping crests<br/> are wicked rogues,<br/> but Pāṭaliya, the headman, is not a wicked rogue.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Why then does not the Tathāgata, get this <span class="f2 g"><b>[246]</b></span> said of him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Tathāgata, knows magic,<br/> but the Tathāgata, is not a trickster'?</p>

    <p class="f4">Idle babble, headman,<br/> do I know<br/> and the fruits thereof,<br/> and, how practising,<br/> one who is an idle babbler,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death is reborn in the Woeful State,<br/> the Evil Lot,<br/> the Downfall,<br/> in Purgatory, -<br/> that also do I know.</p>

    <h4 class="ctr sigil_not_in_toc">1.</h4>

    <p class="f4">There are, headman, certain recluses and brahmins<br/> who teach this,<br/> who have this view:</p>
