    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, Brethren, the Uncompounded<br/> and the path that goes to the Uncompounded.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is the Uncompounded?</p>

    <p class="f4">The destruction of lust, Brethren,<br/> the destruction of hatred,<br/> the destruction of illusion, -<br/> that is called the Uncompounded.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is the path<br/> that goes to the Uncompounded?</p>

    <p class="f4">The five controlling powers.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That, Brethren, is called<br/> 'the path that goes to the Uncompounded.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, Brethren, have I taught ye the Uncompounded.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I taught ye the way that goes to the Uncompounded.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatever should be done<br/> by a teacher that seeks the welfare of his disciples,<br/> in compassion,<br/> feeling compassion,<br/> that have I done for you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here, Brethren, are the roots of trees.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here are empty places.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you meditate.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be not remiss.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be not remorseful hereafter.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is our instruction to you.</p>
