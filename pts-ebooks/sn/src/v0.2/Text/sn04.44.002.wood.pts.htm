    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Vesalī, in Great Grove, at the Hall of the Gabled Home.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time the venerable Anuradha<br/> was staying not far from the Exalted One<br/> in a forest hut.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of heretical Wanderers<br/> came to visit the venerable Anuradha,<br/> greeted him<br/> and exchanged the courtesies of civil words<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, those heretical Wanderers<br/> said to the venerable Anuradha: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend Anuradha, a Tathāgata,<br/> a superman,<br/> one of the best of men,<br/> a winner of the highest winning,<br/> is proclaimed in (one of) these four ways:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, exists after death'</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, does not exist after death,</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, both does and does not exist after death,</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, neither exists nor not-exists after death.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Upon this the venerable Anuradha said<br/> to those heretical Wanderers: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, a Tathāgata,<br/> a superman,<br/> one of the best of men,<br/> a winner of the highest gain,<br/> is spoken of in other than those four ways,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, exists after death'</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, does not exist after death,</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, neither exists nor not-exists after death.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Upon this those heretical Wanderers<br/> said of the venerable Anuradha:</p>

    <p class="f4">"This brother must be a novice, not long ordained.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, if he is an elder, he is an ignorant fool."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[270]</b></span> So those heretical Wanderers,<br/> having thus abused the venerable Anuradha,<br/> by calling him 'novice' and 'fool,'<br/> rose up and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Anuradha,<br/> not long after those heretical Wanderers were gone,<br/> thought thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"If these heretical Wanderers<br/> were to put me a further question,<br/> how, in answering,<br/> should I tell them the views of the Exalted One<br/> without misrepresenting the Exalted One<br/> by stating an untruth?</p>

    <p class="f4">How should I answer<br/> in accordance with his teaching,<br/> so that no one who agrees with his teaching<br/> and follows his views<br/> might incur reproach?</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Anuradha<br/> went to the Exalted One<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Anuradha thus addressed the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am staying here, lord,<br/> in a forest hut<br/> not far from the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a number of heretical Wanderers came to me<br/> greeted me<br/> and exchanged the courtesies of civil words<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now what think you, Anuradha?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent!"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[271]</b></span> "Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is impermanent,<br/> is that weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now what is impermanent,<br/> what is woe,<br/> what is of a nature to change, -<br/> is it proper to regard that thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is mine.</p>

    <p class="f4">This am I.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my self.'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is impermanent,<br/> is that weal or woe?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my self.'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Therefore, Anuradha, whatsoever body,<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> subtle or gross,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near, -<br/> every body<br/> should be regarded,<br/> as it really is,<br/> by perfect insight,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

    <p class="f4">This am not I.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is not my self.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever feelings<br/> be they past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> subtle or gross,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near, -<br/> every feeling<br/> should be regarded,<br/> as it really is,<br/> by perfect insight,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

    <p class="f4">This am not I.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is not my self.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever perception<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> subtle or gross,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near, -<br/> every perception<br/> should be regarded,<br/> as it really is,<br/> by perfect insight,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

    <p class="f4">This am not I.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is not my self.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever activities<br/> be they past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> subtle or gross,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near, -<br/> every activity<br/> should be regarded,<br/> as it really is,<br/> by perfect insight,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

    <p class="f4">This am not I.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is not my self.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever consciousness<br/> be it past,<br/> future<br/> or present,<br/> inward or outward,<br/> subtle or gross,<br/> low or high,<br/> far or near, -<br/> every consciousness<br/> should be regarded,<br/> as it really is,<br/> by perfect insight,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

    <p class="f4">This am not I.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is not my self.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So seeing, Anuradha,<br/> the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/> feels aversion from body,<br/> feels aversion from feeling,<br/> feels aversion from perception,<br/> feels aversion from the activities,<br/> feels aversion from consciousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">So feeling,<br/> he is dispassionate.</p>

    <p class="f4">By dispassion<br/> be is set free.</p>

    <p class="f4">By freedom<br/> comes the knowledge that he is free.</p>

    <p class="f4">So that he knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Ended is birth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in such conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what say you, Anuradha?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you regard a Tathāgata's, body<br/> as the Tathāgata?"</p>
