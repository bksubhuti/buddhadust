    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great were staying at Benares,<br/> in Isipatana,<br/> at Antelope Wood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great,<br/> rising at eventide from his solitary meditation,<br/> came to see the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> and on coming to him,<br/> after the exchange of friendly greetings<br/> and the compliments of courtesy,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the venerable Kotthita the Great said: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"How now, friend Sāriputta?</p>

    <p class="f4">Does the Tathāgata, exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, not exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, both exist and not exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, neither exist nor not-exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"How then friend?</p>

    <p class="f4">When I ask the question:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Does the Tathāgata, exist after death?'</p>

    <p class="f4">you reply:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When I ask the question:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Does the Tathāgata, not exist after death?'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> It is to be remembered that Tathāgata, is defined by the <i>Comy.</i> here and elsewhere as equivalent to <i>satta,</i> any being. The question is that common to all, 'What becomes of us after death?' not only 'What becomes of the Tathāgata, (as Buddha)?' There are many passages, however, where the Master refers to himself in this connexion. At the <i>Udāna</i> <i>Comy.,</i> p. 340, <i>Tathāgata = attā,</i> 'the self.' At <i>M.</i> i,. 338 it = a Saint. See <i>Brethren,</i> 393, <i>n.</i> 4; <i>K.S.</i> iii, 95 <i>n.</i> Perhaps 'liberated being' is the best term for general use</p>
