    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great were staying at Benares,<br/> in Isipatana,<br/> at Antelope Wood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great,<br/> rising at eventide from his solitary meditation,<br/> came to see the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> and on coming to him,<br/> after the exchange of friendly greetings<br/> and the compliments of courtesy,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the venerable Kotthita the Great said: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"How now, friend Sāriputta?</p>

    <p class="f4">Does the Tathāgata, exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, not exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, both exist and not exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, neither exist nor not-exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"How then friend?</p>

    <p class="f4">When I ask the question:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Does the Tathāgata, exist after death?'</p>

    <p class="f4">you reply:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When I ask the question:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Does the Tathāgata, not exist after death?'</p>

    <p class="f4">you reply:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is the reason, friend,<br/> what is the cause<br/> why this thing is not revealed by the Exalted One?"</p>
