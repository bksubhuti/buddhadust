    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Wanderer, Vacchagotta, came to visit the Exalted One<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of civilities<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer, Vacchagotta,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master Gotama, some time ago,<br/> on some former occasions,<br/> when a number of sectarians of different views,<br/> both recluses and brahmins,<br/> who were Wanderers,<br/> had met together<br/> and were sitting in the Debating Hall,<br/> this topic of talk arose: -</p>

    <p class="f4">Pūraṇa Kassapa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> here,<br/> who has a crowd of followers,<br/> who is teacher of a crowd,<br/> a well-known and famous founder of theories,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> one in high repute among the manyfolk,<br/> when speaking of a disciple<br/> who had passed away,<br/> who had made <span class="f2 g"><b>[280]</b></span> an end, thus describes his rebirth:</p>

    <p class="f4">And in like manner, Ajita of the haircloth, here,<br/> who has a crowd of followers,<br/> who is teacher of a crowd,<br/> a well-known and famous founder of theories,<br/> one in high repute among the manyfolk,<br/> when speaking of a disciple<br/> who had passed away,<br/> who had made an end, thus describes his rebirth:</p>

    <p class="f4">So and so is reborn thus and thus."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Gotama the recluse,<br/> who has a crowd of followers,<br/> who is teacher of a crowd,<br/> a well-known and famous founder of theories,<br/> one in high repute among the manyfolk,<br/> when speaking of a disciple<br/> who had passed away,<br/> who had made an end, thus describes his rebirth:</p>

    <p class="f4">"So and so is reborn thus and thus.</p>

    <p class="f4">So and so is reborn thus and thus."</p>

    <p class="f4">But if one of his disciples is a superman,<br/> one who has won the highest gain,<br/> when speaking of such a disciple<br/> who has passed away,<br/> who has made an end,<br/> does not describe him in terms of rebirth,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"So and so is reborn thus and thus."</p>

    <p class="f4">But he describes him thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"He has cut off craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">He has broken the bond.</p>

    <p class="f4">By perfect comprehension of conceit<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> he has made an end of ill."'</p>

    <p class="f4">Of this matter, master Gotama,<br/> I had doubt and wavering,<br/> and I thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How is the teaching of Gotama the recluse<br/> to be understood in this matter?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"You may well doubt, Vaccha.</p>

    <p class="f4">You may well waver.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, your wavering has arisen<br/> on a doubtful point.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to rebirth, Vaccha,<br/> I declare it to be for what has fuel,<br/> not for what is without fuel.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, Vaccha,<br/> a fire with fuel blazes up,<br/> but not without fuel,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> even so, Vaccha, do I declare rebirth<br/> to be for what has fuel,<br/> not for what is without fuel."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[281]</b></span> "But, master Gotama,<br/> at the time when a flame,<br/> flung by the wind,<br/> goes a very long way,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> as to fuel<br/> what says the master Gotama about this?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"At the time when a flame, Vaccha,<br/> flung by the wind<br/> goes a very long way,<br/> I declare that flame<br/> to be supported by the wind.</p>

    <p class="f4">At that time, Vaccha,<br/> the wind is its fuel."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, master Gotama,<br/> at the time when a being<br/> lays aside this body<br/> and rises up again in another body, -<br/> what does master Gotama declare<br/> to be the fuel for that?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"At the time, Vacoha,<br/> when a being lays aside this body<br/> and rises up again in another body,<br/> for that I declare<br/> craving to be the fuel.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, Vaccha,<br/> craving is on that occasion the fuel."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

This thought is called <i>cuti-citta</i> (decease thought). Hence on his death-bed a man is urged by his friends and relatives to fix his thoughts on profitable things, in order to be reborn accordantly. See the death-bed scene of Citta (supra). The <i>khīṇāsava</i> or Arahant, having no <i>upādāna</i> (fuel or grasping), has no thought attaching him to any object <i>(kiñcana),</i> so his flame flickers out for want of fuel.</p>
