    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Wanderer, Vacchagotta, came to visit the Exalted One<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of civilities<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer, Vacchagotta,<br/> said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, master Gotama, is there a self?"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words the Exalted One was silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">"How, then, master Gotama, is there not a self?"</p>

    <p class="f4">For a second time also the Exalted One was silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Vacchagotta the Wanderer rose from his seat and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of Vacchagotta the Wanderer<br/> the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"How is it, lord,<br/> that the Exalted One gave no answer<br/> to the question of Vacchagotta the Wanderer?"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[282]</b></span> 'If, Ānanda, when asked by the Wanderer:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is there a self?'</p>

    <p class="f4">I had replied to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is a self,'</p>

    <p class="f4">then, Ānanda,<br/> that would be siding<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> with the recluses and brahmins<br/> who are eternalists.</p>

    <p class="f4">But if, Ānanda, when asked:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is there not a self?'</p>

    <p class="f4">I had replied that</p>

    <p class="f4">'It does not exist',</p>

    <p class="f4">that, Ānanda, would be siding<br/> with those recluses and brahmins<br/> who are annihilationists.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, when asked by the Wanderer:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is there a self?'</p>

    <p class="f4">had I replied that</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is',</p>

    <p class="f4">would my reply be in accordance with the knowledge<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> that</p>

    <p class="f4">'All things are not-self'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Again, Ānanda, when asked by the Wanderer:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is there not a self?'</p>

    <p class="f4">had I replied that</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is not',</p>

    <p class="f4">it would have been more bewilderment<br/> for the bewildered Vacchagotta.</p>

    <p class="f4">For he would have said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Formerly indeed I had a self,<br/> but now I have not one any more.'"</p>
