    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sabhiya of the Kaccanas<br/> was staying at Ñātika in the Brick Hall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Wanderer Vacchagotta went to visit the venerable Sabhiya,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him in friendly fashion,<br/> and after the exchange of civilities,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the Wanderer Vacchagotta said to the venerable Sabhiya: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"How say you, master Kaccana?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Does the Tathāgata, exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"That, Vaccha, is not revealed by the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, not exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"That, Vaccha, is not revealed by the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, both exist and not exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"That, Vaccha, is not revealed by the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, neither exist nor not-exist after death?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"That, Vaccha, is not revealed by the Exalted One."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, master Kaccana, what is the reason,<br/> what is the cause<br/> why the Wanderers of other views,<br/> when questioned on these points answer that:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Tathāgata, exists after death.'</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Tathāgata, does not exist after death?'</p>

    <p class="f4">or:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Tathāgata, both exists and does not exist after death'</p>

    <p class="f4">or:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Tathāgata, neither exists nor does not-exist after death'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, master Kaccana, what is the reason,<br/> what is the cause<br/> why Gotama the recluse,<br/> when questioned thus,<br/> does not answer that:</p>

    <p class="f4">The Tathāgata, exists after death.'</p>

    <p class="f4">or</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Tathāgata, does not exist after death?'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now as to the reason,<br/> the grounds,<br/> for describing him as 'embodied'<br/> or 'disembodied',<br/> as 'conscious'<br/> or 'unconscious',<br/> as 'neither conscious nor unconscious', -<br/> if such reason,<br/> such grounds,<br/> should cease in every way,<br/> entirely,<br/> wholly,<br/> utterly<br/> and without remainder,<br/> by what definition<br/> could one describe him<br/> as 'embodied'<br/> or 'disembodied',<br/> as 'conscious'<br/> or 'unconscious',<br/> as 'neither conscious nor unconscious?'"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"How long have you been ordained, Kaccana?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Not long, friend.</p>

    <p class="f4">Only three years."</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is indeed a great thing, friend,<br/> for one to know thus much<br/> in so short a time;<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> not to speak of things abstruse."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
