    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br/> at Sakkara,<br/> a Sakyan township.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Ānanda said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The half of the holy life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> lord,<br/> it is friendship with what is lovely,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> association with what is lovely,<br/> intimacy with what is lovely!'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Say not so, Ānanda!</p>

    <p class="f4">Say not so, Ānanda!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the whole,<br/> not the half,<br/> of the holy life, -<br/> this friendship,<br/> this association,<br/> this intimacy with what is lovely.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of a monk who is a friend,<br/> an associate,<br/> an intimate<br/> of what is lovely<br/> we may expect this, -<br/> that he will develop the Ariyan eightfold way,<br/> that he will make much of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Ānanda, does such a monk<br/> develop and make much of<br/> the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span> Herein,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> Ānanda, he cultivates right view,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right aim,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">likewise right speech,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right action,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right living,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right effort,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Ānanda, is how a monk who is a friend,<br/> an associate,<br/> an intimate of what is lovely,<br/> cultivates and makes much of<br/> the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the method, Ānanda,<br/> by which you are to understand<br/> how the whole of this holy life<br/> consists in friendship,<br/> in association,<br/> in intimacy<br/> with what is lovely.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, Ānanda, beings liable to rebirth<br/> are liberated from rebirth;<br/> beings liable to decay,<br/> liable to death,<br/> liable to grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair,<br/> are liberated therefrom<br/> because of my friendship with what is lovely.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It is by this method, Ānanda,<br/> that you are to understand how<br/> the whole of this holy life<br/> consists in friendship,<br/> in association,<br/> in intimacy with what is lovely.</p>
