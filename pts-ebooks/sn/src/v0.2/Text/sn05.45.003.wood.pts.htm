    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated he said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The whole of the holy life, lord,<br/> consists in friendship,<br/> in association,<br/> in intimacy with what is lovely.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well said! Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">The whole,<br/> consists in friendship,<br/> in association,<br/> in intimacy with what is lovely.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Of a monk who is a friend,<br/> an associate,<br/> an intimate<br/> of what is lovely<br/> we may expect this, -<br/> that he will develop the Ariyan eightfold way,<br/> that he will make much of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Sāriputta, does such a monk<br/> develop and make much of<br/> the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Sāriputta, he cultivates right view,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right aim,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">likewise right speech,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right action,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right living,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right effort,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Sāriputta, is how a monk who is a friend,<br/> an associate,<br/> an intimate of what is lovely,<br/> cultivates and makes much of<br/> the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the method, Sāriputta,<br/> by which you are to understand<br/> how the whole of this holy life<br/> consists in friendship,<br/> in association,<br/> in intimacy<br/> with what is lovely.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, Sāriputta, beings liable to rebirth<br/> are liberated from rebirth;<br/> beings liable to decay,<br/> liable to death,<br/> liable to grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair,<br/> are liberated therefrom<br/> because of my friendship with what is lovely.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is by this method, Sāriputta,<br/> that you are to understand how<br/> the whole of this holy life<br/> consists in friendship,<br/> in association,<br/> in intimacy with what is lovely.</p>
