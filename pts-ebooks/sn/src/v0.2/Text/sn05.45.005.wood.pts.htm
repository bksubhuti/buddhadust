    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of monks came to visit the Exalted One<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Here, lord, the wanderers holding other views ask us this question:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What is it, friends,<br/> for which the holy life is lived<br/> under Gotama the recluse?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus questioned, lord,<br/> we thus reply to those wanderers holding other views:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is for the full understanding of ill, friends,<br/> that the holy life is lived<br/> under Gotama the recluse.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus questioned, lord,<br/> and thus replying,<br/> do we state the views of the Exalted One,<br/> without misrepresenting the Exalted One<br/> by stating an untruth?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do we answer in accordance<br/> with his teaching,<br/> so that no one who agrees with his teaching<br/> and follows his views<br/> could incur reproach?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Truly, monks, thus questioned<br/> and thus replying,<br/> ye do state my views<br/> without misrepresenting me<br/> by stating an untruth.</p>

    <p class="f4">You do answer in accordance<br/> with my teaching,<br/> so that no one who agrees with my teaching<br/> and follows my views<br/> could incur reproach<br/> in stating that it is for the full understanding of Ill<br/> that the holy life is lived under my rule.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But if, monks, the wanderers holding other views<br/> should thus question you:</p>

    <p class="f4">'But, friends, is there any way,<br/> is there any practice<br/> for the full understanding of this Ill?' -<br/> thus questioned, monks,<br/> thus should ye reply to those wanderers of other views:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friends, there is indeed a Way,<br/> there is indeed a practice<br/> for the full understanding of this ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is that Way,<br/> what that practice?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is this very Ariyan eightfold way;<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the Way,<br/> this is the practice<br/> for the full understanding of this Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus questioned, monks,<br/> thus should ye reply<br/> to those wanderers holding other views."</p>
