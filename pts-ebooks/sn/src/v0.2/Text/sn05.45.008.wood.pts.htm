    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will teach you, monks, the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will analyse it for you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen.</p>

    <p class="f4">Give careful heed and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," said those monks in assent to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One then said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What, monks, is the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is<br/> right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is right view?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the knowledge of Ill,<br/> knowledge of the arising of ill,<br/> knowledge <span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span> of the ceasing of ill,<br/> and knowledge of the practice leading to the ceasing of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is called 'right view.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is right aim?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the aim to renounce,<br/> the aim to be free from malice,<br/> the aim to be harmless.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is called 'right aim.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is right speech?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the avoiding of lying speech,<br/> the avoiding of calumny,<br/> of cutting speech,<br/> of wanton speech.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is called 'right speech.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is right action?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the avoiding of taking life,<br/> the avoiding of stealing,<br/> the avoiding of unchastity.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is called 'right action.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is right living?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple,<br/> by abandoning a wrong way of life,<br/> gets his living by a right way of life.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is called 'right living.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is right effort?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk puts forth desire [to do],<br/> makes an effort,<br/> begins to strive,<br/> applies his mind,<br/> lays hold of his mind<br/> to prevent the arising of ill,<br/> unprofitable states<br/> not yet arisen.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to ill,<br/> unprofitable states that have arisen,<br/> he puts forth desire<br/> makes an effort,<br/> begins to strive,<br/> applies his mind,<br/> lays hold of his mind<br/> to destroy them.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to profitable states<br/> that have not yet arisen,<br/> he puts forth desire<br/> makes an effort,<br/> begins to strive,<br/> applies his mind,<br/> lays hold of his mind<br/> for their arising.</p>

    <p class="f4">As to profitable states<br/> that have already arisen,<br/> he puts forth desire,<br/> makes an effort,<br/> begins to strive,<br/> applies his mind,<br/> lays hold of his mind<br/> for their continuance,<br/> for their non-confusion,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> for their more-becoming,<br/> increase,<br/> culture<br/> and fulfilment.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is called 'right effort.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is right mindfulness?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk abides contemplating body in body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed,<br/> mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He abides contemplating feelings in feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed,<br/> mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He abides contemplating mind in mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed,<br/> mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He abides contemplating mind-states in mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed,<br/> mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called 'right mindfulness.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[9]</b></span> And what, monks, is right concentration?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk, aloof from sensuality,<br/> aloof from evil states,<br/> enters on the first trance,<br/> which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of solitude,<br/> easeful and zestful,<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">By the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/> he enters on the inward calm,<br/> that one-pointedness of mind,<br/> apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/> that is born of mental balance,<br/> zestful and easeful,<br/> that is the second trance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br/> he abides indifferent,<br/> mindful and composed,<br/> and experiences ease through the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having entered on the third trance,<br/> which the Ariyans describe in these terms:</p>

    <p class="f4">"He who is indifferent and mindful dwells happily,"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">he abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, by the abandoning of ease,<br/> by the abandoning of discomfort,<br/> by the destruction of the happiness and unhappiness<br/> that he had before,<br/> having entered on that state<br/> which is neither pleasant nor painful,<br/> that utter purity of mindfulness<br/> reached by indifference,<br/> which is the fourth trance,<br/> he abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called 'right concentration.'"</p>
