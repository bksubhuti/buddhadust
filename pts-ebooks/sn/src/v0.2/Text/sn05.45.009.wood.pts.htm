    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Suppose, monks, the spike of bearded wheat<br/> or bearded barley<br/> be wrongly aimed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> when pressed by hand or foot<br/> will it pierce<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> hand or foot,<br/> will it draw blood?</p>

    <p class="f4">It cannot be so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because the spike is wrongly aimed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, monks, it cannot be<br/> that the monk whose view is wrongly aimed,<br/> whose way-culture is wrongly aimed,<br/> can pierce through ignorance,<br/> draw knowledge<br/> and realize Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because his view is wrongly aimed.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[10]</b></span> But, monks, suppose that the spike of bearded wheat<br/> or bearded barley<br/> be well aimed.</p>

    <p class="f4">When pressed by hand or foot,<br/> it is certain<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> that it will pierce hand or foot<br/> and draw blood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, monks, the spike is well aimed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, monks, it is certain<br/> that the monk whose view is well aimed,<br/> whose way-culture is well aimed,<br/> can pierce through ignorance,<br/> draw knowledge,<br/> and realize Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, monks, of the right aim of his view.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how does a monk<br/> by well aimed view,<br/> by well aimed way-culture,<br/> so pierce through ignorance,<br/> draw knowledge<br/> and realize Nibbāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, he cultivates right view,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right aim,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right speech,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right action,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right living,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right effort,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration,<br/> which is based on detachment,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how this monk,<br/> by well aimed view,<br/> by well aimed path-culture,<br/> pierces through ignorance,<br/> draws knowledge<br/> and realizes Nibbāna."</p>
