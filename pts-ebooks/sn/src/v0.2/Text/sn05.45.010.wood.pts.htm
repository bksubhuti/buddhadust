    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Nandiya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the wanderer came to the Exalted One,<br/> and on reaching him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Nandiya the wanderer<br/> said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What conditions are there, master Gotama,<br/> which when cultivated and made much of,<br/> lead to Nibbāna,<br/> have Nibbāna for their goal,<br/> end in Nibbāna?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are eight conditions, Nandiya,<br/> which when cultivated and made much of,<br/> lead to Nibbāna,<br/> have Nibbāna for their goal,<br/> end in Nibbāna,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">These eight conditions, Nandiya, when cultivated and made much of,<br/> lead to Nibbāna,<br/> have Nibbāna for their goal,<br/> end in Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Nandiya the wanderer said this to the-Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span> "Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as one raises what is fallen<br/> or shows forth what is hidden,<br/> or points out the way<br/> to him that wanders astray,<br/> or holds up a light in the darkness<br/> so that they who have eyes may see objects,<br/> — even so in divers ways<br/> has Dhamma, been set forth<br/> by master Gotama.</p>

    <p class="f4">I myself go for refuge to Gotama,<br/> the Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama accept me as a lay disciple,<br/> as one who has gone to him for refuge<br/> from this day forth,<br/> so long as I have life."</p>
