    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I desire to dwell in solitude<br/> for three months.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not to be visited by any<br/> save by him alone who brings my food."</p>

    <p class="f4">"So be it, lord"<br/> replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus no one visited the Exalted One<br/> save the one who brought his food.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at the end of those three months the Exalted One,<br/> leaving his solitude,<br/> addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I have been dwelling partly<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> in the same manner as I did<br/> after I first attained enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus I came to know<br/> what is experienced as a result of wrong view,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong view,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of right view<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right view,<br/> what is experienced as a result of wrong aim,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong aim,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of right aim<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right aim,<br/> what is experienced as a result of wrong speech,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong speech,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of right speech<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right speech,<br/> what is experienced as a result of wrong action,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong action,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of right action<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right action,<br/> what is experienced as a result of wrong living,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong living,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of right living<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right living,<br/> what is experienced as a result of wrong effort,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong effort,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of right effort<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right effort,<br/> what is experienced as a result of wrong mindfulness,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong mindfulness,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of right mindfulness<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right mindfulness,<br/> what is experienced as a result of wrong concentration,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong concentration,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of right concentration:<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise I came to know what is experienced as a result of desire,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing desire,<br/> what is experienced as a result of directed thought,<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing directed thought,<br/> what is experienced as a result of perception.<br/> and what is experienced as a result of suppressing perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">When desire is not suppressed,<br/> directed thought is not suppressed,<br/> perception is not suppressed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to these<br/> there is experience.</p>

    <p class="f4">(When desire is suppressed,<br/> but directed thought<br/> and perception<br/> are not suppressed,<br/> owing to these<br/> there is experience.</p>

    <p class="f4">When desire<br/> and directed thought<br/> are suppressed,<br/> but not perception,<br/> then there is experience.)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When desire<br/> and directed thought<br/> and perception,<br/> are suppressed,<br/> owing to that there is experience.</p>

    <p class="f4">For one who has not attained<br/> there is the effort to do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">When that state is attained,<br/> owing to that there is experience."</p>
