    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And who, monks, is the unworthy?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one has<br/> wrong view,<br/> wrong aim,<br/> wrong speech,<br/> wrong action,<br/> wrong living,<br/> wrong effort,<br/> wrong mindfulness<br/> wrong concentration.</p>
