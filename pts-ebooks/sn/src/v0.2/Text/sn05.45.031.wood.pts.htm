    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you wrong conduct and right conduct.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is wrong conduct?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is as follows:</p>

    <p class="f4">Wrong view,<br/> wrong aim,<br/> wrong speech,<br/> wrong action,<br/> wrong living,<br/> wrong effort,<br/> wrong mindfulness<br/> wrong concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called 'wrong conduct.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is right conduct?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is as follows:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called 'right conduct.'"</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> does not number the following suttas till p. 45 of text, which is unusual. Léon Feer (Introduction, p. vi vol. v) discusses the matter at length, and concludes that the next two chapters were 'inserted, apparently, as a lengthening of the fourth chapter.' I have therefore, numbered them as sub-sections of cap. 4. Text calls them Nos. 31-148. [Ed note: we follow the PTS Pali text numbering but insert the Sub-headings.]</p>
