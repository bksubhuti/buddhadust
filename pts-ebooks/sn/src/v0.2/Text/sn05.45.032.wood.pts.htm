    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you both the wrongly conducted and the rightly conducted.<br/> Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And who, monks, is the wrongly conducted? Herein, monks, a certain one has wrong view,<br/> wrong aim,<br/> wrong speech,<br/> wrong action,<br/> wrong living,<br/> wrong effort,<br/> wrong mindfulness<br/> wrong concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one is called 'wrongly conducted.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And who, monks, is rightly conducted?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one has right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one is called 'rightly conducted.'"</p>
