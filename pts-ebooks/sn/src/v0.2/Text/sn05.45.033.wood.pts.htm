    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"By whomsoever, monks, the Ariyan eightfold way is neglected,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> by them is neglected the Ariyan eightfold way<br/> that leads to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">By whomsoever the Ajiyan eightfold way is undertaken,<br/> by them is undertaken the Ariyan eightfold way<br/> that leads to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Aiiyan eightfold way?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is as follows:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">"By whomsoever, monks, the Ariyan eightfold way is neglected,<br/> by them is neglected the Ariyan eightfold way<br/> that leads to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">By whomsoever the Ajiyan eightfold way is undertaken,<br/> by them is undertaken the Ariyan eightfold way<br/> that leads to the utter destruction of ill.</p>
