    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a great number of monks came to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side the Exalted One said to them: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if the wanderers holding other views should thus question you:</p>

    <p class="f4">'What is it, friends, for which the holy life is lived<br/> under (the rule of) Gotama the recluse?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus questioned, monks,<br/> ye should reply thus<br/> to those wanderers of other views:</p>

    <p class="f4">'With the aim of thorough comprehension of the way out,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> friends, the holy life is lived<br/> under the rule of Gotama the recluse.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But if, monks, the wanderers of other views<br/> should thus question you:</p>

    <p class="f4">'But, friends, is there a way,<br/> is there a practice<br/> leading to the thorough comprehension of the way out?' -</p>

    <p class="f4">thus questioned, monks,<br/> thus should ye make reply<br/> to those wanderers of other views:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friends, there is indeed a way,<br/> there is indeed a practice<br/> leading to the thorough comprehension of the way out.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the way,<br/> what the practice<br/> leading to the thorough comprehension of the way out?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just this Ariyan eightfold way,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the way,<br/> this is the practice<br/> leading to the thorough comprehension of the way out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus questioned, monks,<br/> thus should ye make reply<br/> to those wanderers holding other views."</p>
