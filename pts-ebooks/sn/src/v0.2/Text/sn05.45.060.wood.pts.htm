    <p class="f4">Just as, monks, the dawn is the forerunner, the harbinger, of the arising of the sun, even so insight is the forerunner, the harbinger, of the arising of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of a monk who has insight, monks, it may be expected that he will cultivate the Ariyan eightfold way, that he will make much of the Ariyan eightfold way. And how, monks, does a monk who has insight cultivate and make much of the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates right view, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right aim, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right speech, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right action, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right living, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right effort, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration, which is based on detachment, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Ānanda, is how a monk who has insight cultivates and makes much of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>
