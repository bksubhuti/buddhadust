    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Supported, monks, by Himalaya,<br/> lord of mountains,<br/> snakes grow a body<br/> and get strength.</p>

    <p class="f4">When they have grown a body<br/> and got strength there,<br/> they go down to the tarns.</p>

    <p class="f4">From the tarns<br/> they go down to the lakes,</p>

    <p class="f4">From the lakes<br/> they go down to the small rivers,</p>

    <p class="f4">From the small rivers<br/> they go down to the great rivers,</p>

    <p class="f4">From the great rivers<br/> they go down to the sea,<br/> they go down to the mighty ocean.</p>

    <p class="f4">There they get great size and growth of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, monks, a monk supported by virtue,<br/> fixed in virtue,<br/> cultivating the seven limbs of wisdom<br/> and making much of them,<br/> wins to greatness and growth in conditions.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And how does a monk supported by virtue,<br/> fixed in virtue,<br/> cultivating the seven limbs of wisdom<br/> and making much of them,<br/> wins to greatness and growth in conditions?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is mindfulness,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is investigation of the Norm,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is energy,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is zest,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is tranquillity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is concentration,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is equanimity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how a monk supported by virtue,<br/> fixed in virtue,<br/> by <span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span> cultivating the seven limbs of wisdom<br/> and making much of them,<br/> wins to greatness and growth in conditions.</p>
