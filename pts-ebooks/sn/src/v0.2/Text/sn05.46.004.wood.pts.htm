    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Brother monks!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, friend," replied those monks to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, there are these seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm-investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the seven.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of these seven limbs of wisdom, friends,<br/> in which soever I desire to abide<br/> during the early part of the day,<br/> in that limb of wisdom<br/> I abide.</p>

    <p class="f4">In which soever limb of wisdom<br/> I desire to abide<br/> in the middle of the day,<br/> in that I abide.</p>

    <p class="f4">In which soever limb of wisdom<br/> I desire to abide<br/> in the evening,<br/> in that I abide.</p>

    <p class="f4">If, friends, it is the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> in such case I fully know that it is boundless in me,<br/> or that it is well begun in me, or,<br/> when it is established in me,<br/> I fully know that it is so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, if it fails me,<br/> I fully know that it is owing to this or <span class="f2 g"><b>[59]</b></span> that cause.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">If, friends, it is the limb of wisdom that is Norm-investigation,<br/> in such case I fully know that it is boundless in me,<br/> or that it is well begun in me, or,<br/> when it is established in me,<br/> I fully know that it is so.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just like the wardrobe of a rajah<br/> or great nobleman,<br/> full of garments of various hues.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever suit he desires to don in the forenoon,<br/> that he dons in the forenoon.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever suit he desires to don at midday,<br/> that he dons at midday.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever suit he desires to don at eventide,<br/> that he dons at eventide.</p>
