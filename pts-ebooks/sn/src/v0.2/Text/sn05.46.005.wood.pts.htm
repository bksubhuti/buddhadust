    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then a certain monk came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated that monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Wisdom limb! Wisdom limb!' is the saying, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far is this name applicable?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"They conduce to wisdom, monk.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is why they are so called.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is mindfulness,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is investigation of the Norm,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is energy,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is zest,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is tranquillity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is concentration,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is equanimity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he cultivates these seven limbs of wisdom<br/> he frees his heart from the <i>āsava</i> of sensuality,<br/> from the <i>āsava</i> of becoming,<br/> from the <i>āsava</i> of nescience.</p>

    <p class="f4">The knowledge comes to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Freed am I by being freed'<br/> so that he fully knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Cut off is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">They conduce to wisdom, monk.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is why they are so called.'</p>
