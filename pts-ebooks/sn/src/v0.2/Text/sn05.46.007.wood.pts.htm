    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just as, monks, in a peaked house<br/> all rafters whatsoever<br/> go together to the peak,<br/> slope to the peak,<br/> join in the peak,<br/> and of them all<br/> the peak is reckoned chief,<br/> even so, monks, the monk<br/> who cultivates and makes much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> slopes to Nibbāna,<br/> inclines to Nibbāna,<br/> tends to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk<br/> who cultivates and makes much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom<br/> slope to Nibbāna,<br/> incline to Nibbāna,<br/> tend to Nibbāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is mindfulness,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is investigation of the Norm,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is energy,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is zest,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is tranquillity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is concentration,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is equanimity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus cultivated, Kuṇḍaliya<br/> thus made much of,<br/> do the seven limbs of wisdom<br/> complete the release by knowledge."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus cultivated and made much of, monks,<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom<br/> slope to Nibbāna,<br/> incline to Nibbāna,<br/> tend to Nibbāna.</p>
