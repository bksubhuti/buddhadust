    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> not having yet arisen,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> do arise,<br/> but not without the manifestation of a Tathāgata,<br/> an Arahant,<br/> a fully enlightened one.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity</p>

    <p class="f4">These seven limbs of wisdom, monks<br/> not having yet arisen,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> do arise,<br/> but not without the manifestation of a Tathāgata,<br/> an Arahant,<br/> a fully enlightened one.</p>
