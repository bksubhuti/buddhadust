    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha<br/> in Bamboo Grove<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/> the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> was staying on the hill Vulture's Peak,<br/> and was sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> stricken with a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/> rising from his solitude at eventide,<br/> went to visit the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Exalted One as he sat<br/> said to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, Moggallāna, I hope you are bearing up.</p>

    <p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br/> and not increase?</p>

    <p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating<br/> and not increasing?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not bearing up.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating,<br/> but of their increasing."</p>

    <p class="f4">Moggallāna, these seven limbs of wisdom<br/> fully expounded by myself,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom, Kassapa, that is mindfulness,<br/> fully expounded by myself,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, fully expounded by myself,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is energy, fully expounded by myself,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, fully expounded by myself,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is concentration, fully expounded by myself,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is equanimity, fully expounded by myself,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">These seven limbs of wisdom, Kassapa,<br/> fully expounded by myself,<br/> if cultivated,<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Verily, lord, they are limbs of wisdom!</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, O Happy One, they are limbs of wisdom!"</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One,<br/> and the venerable Moggallāna the Great was delighted thereat,<br/> and took pleasure in what was said by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Kassapa the Great<br/> rose up from that sickness.</p>

    <p class="f4">There and then that sickness of the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> was abandoned.</p>
