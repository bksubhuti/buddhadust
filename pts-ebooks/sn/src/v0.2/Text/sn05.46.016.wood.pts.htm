    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha<br/> in Bamboo Grove<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/> the Exalted One<br/> and was sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> stricken with a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Cunda the Great<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/> the Exalted One said to the venerable Cunda the Great:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Cunda, call to mind<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the limbs of wisdom."</p>

    <p class="f4">"These seven limbs of wisdom, lord,<br/> fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/> if cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom, lord, that is mindfulness,<br/> fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is energy, fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is tranquillity, fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is concentration, fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is equanimity, fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/> when cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">These seven limbs of wisdom, lord,<br/> fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/> if cultivated,<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to full comprehension,<br/> to wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Verily, Cunda, they are limbs of wisdom!</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily, Cunda, they are limbs of wisdom!"</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke Cunda the Great,<br/> and the Master was <br/> approving of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One rose up from that sickness.</p>

    <p class="f4">There and then that sickness of the Exalted One was abandoned.</p>
