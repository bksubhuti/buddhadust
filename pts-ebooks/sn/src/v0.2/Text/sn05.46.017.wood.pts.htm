    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"These seven limbs of wisdom, monks,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> conduce to no more going to the hither<br/> or the further shore.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity."</p>

    <p class="f4">"These seven limbs of wisdom, monks,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> conduce to no more going to the hither<br/> or the further shore.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">So saying, the Happy One added this further as Teacher:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span> Few are they of mortal men<br/> Who have reached the further shore:<br/> But the crowd of other folk<br/> On this side fare up and down.<br/> They who follow in the teaching<br/> Of the Norm expounded well,<br/> They shall reach the shore and pass<br/> The realm of Death so hard to cross.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Giving up the state of darkness<br/> Let the wise pursue the light:<br/> Giving up home for the homeless,<br/> In solitude where joys are rare,<br/> Let him long for bliss unbounded.<br/> Leaving lusts and owning naught<br/> Let the wise man cleanse himself<br/> From the passions of the heart.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">They whose mind is rightly cultured<br/> In the wisdom's (seven) limbs, -<br/> Glad to have surrendered clinging,<br/> Glad to be from bondage loosed,<br/> Canker-cured, they, all-resplendent,<br/> E'en in this world are at peace.</p>
