    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">For him that acts in accordance therewith<br/> they conduce to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity."</p>
