    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"These seven limbs of wisdom, monks,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> conduce to downright revulsion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> to calm,<br/> to full comprehension,<br/> to the wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity."</p>

    <p class="f4">"These seven limbs of wisdom, monks,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> conduce to downright revulsion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> to calm,<br/> to full comprehension,<br/> to the wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>
