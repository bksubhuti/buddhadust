    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">"The way, monks,<br/> and the practice leading thereto<br/> which conduces to the destruction of craving, -<br/> do ye cultivate that way and practice.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>
