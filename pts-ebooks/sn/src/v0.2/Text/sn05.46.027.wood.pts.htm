    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The way, monks,<br/> and the practice leading thereto<br/> which conduces to the cessation of craving, -<br/> do ye cultivate that way and practice.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is the way, monks,<br/> what the practice<br/> that so conduces?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity."</p>

    <p class="f4">And how cultivated,<br/> how made much of,<br/> do the seven limbs of wisdom<br/> conduce to the cessation<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> of craving?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is mindfulness,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is investigation of the Norm,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is energy,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is zest,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is tranquillity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is equanimity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, cultivated,<br/> thus made much of,<br/> do the seven limbs of wisdom<br/> conduce to the cessation of craving"</p>
