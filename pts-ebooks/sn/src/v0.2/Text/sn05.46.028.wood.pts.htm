    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">I will teach you, monks, the way concerned with penetration.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is that way?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity."</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words the venerable Udāyī said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, how cultivated,<br/> how made much of, do these seven limbs of wisdom conduce to penetration??</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Udayi, a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that <span class="f2 g"><b>[74]</b></span> is mindfulness,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender;<br/> which is far-spreading,<br/> lofty,<br/> boundless,<br/> free of malevolence.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, with mind that has cultivated the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> pierces through,<br/> breaks down<br/> the great mass of lust<br/> that hitherto had not been pierced through<br/> or broken down.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
