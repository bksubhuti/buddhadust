    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">I behold not, monks, any other single condition which,<br/> thus cultivated and made much of,<br/> is so conducive to abandonment<br/> of the conditions that bind<br/> as the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity."</p>

    <p class="f4">And how cultivated, monks,<br/> how made much of<br/> do the seven limbs of wisdom<br/> conduce to the abandonment<br/> of conditions that bind?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that mindfulness,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is investigation of the Norm,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is energy,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is zest,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, are the conditions that bind?</p>

    <p class="f4">The eye, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/> that bind and cleave to one.</p>

    <p class="f4">The ear, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/> that bind and cleave to one.</p>

    <p class="f4">The nose, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/> that bind and cleave to one.</p>

    <p class="f4">The tongue, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/> that bind and cleave to one.</p>

    <p class="f4">The body, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/> that bind and cleave to one.</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/> that bind and cleave to one.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are called<br/> 'conditions that bind.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
