    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sumbha,<br/> at Desaka,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> a district of the Sumbha.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[75]</b></span> Now the venerable Udāyī came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Udāyī said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Strange it is, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">A wonder it is, lord!<br/> how strongly the affection and respect for the Exalted One,<br/> the modesty and delicacy of feeling for him,<br/> have worked<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Formerly, lord, when I was living the life of a householder,<br/> I was not much concerned about the Norm,<br/> not much concerned about<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, lord, when I beheld the affection,<br/> the respect,<br/> the modesty<br/> and delicacy of feeling<br/> for the Exalted One,<br/> I went forth from home<br/> to the homeless.</p>

    <p class="f4">To me it was<br/> that the Exalted One taught the Norm,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Thus is body,<br/> thus the arising of body,<br/> thus the perishing of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is feeling,<br/> thus the arising of feeling,<br/> thus the perishing of feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is perception,<br/> thus the arising of perception,<br/> thus the perishing of perception.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus are the activities<br/> thus the arising of the activities,<br/> thus the perishing of the activities.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is consciousness,<br/> thus the arising of consciousness,<br/> thus the perishing of consciousness.'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, lord, when I had gone into solitude,<br/> while pondering over the rise and fall<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> of these five factors of existence,<br/> I fully realized,<br/> as in truth it is,<br/> the meaning of</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill:<br/> this is the arising of ill:<br/> this is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">I fully realized,<br/> as in truth it is,<br/> the meaning of</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice<br/> that leads to the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, lord, I fully grasped the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">I laid hold of<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> the way,<br/> which, cultivated and made much of,<br/> will lead me,<br/> thus and thus abiding,<br/> to the attainment of being such:<br/> so that I shall come to know:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Cut off is rebirth:<br/> lived is the holy life:<br/> done is the task:<br/> there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, lord, I laid hold of<br/> the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> which, cultivated and made much of,<br/> will lead me on,<br/> thus and thus abiding,<br/> to the state of being such:<br/> so that I shall come to know:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Cut off is rebirth:<br/> lived is the holy life:<br/> done is the task:<br/> there is no more of being here for me.'</p>
