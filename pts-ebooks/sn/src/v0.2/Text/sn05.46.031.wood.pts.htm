    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever conditions, monks,<br/> are the constituent parts of good and bad,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> but are on the side of<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> goodness,<br/> all of them have their root in earnestness,<br/> converge in earnestness;<br/> earnestness is reckoned the chief of those conditions.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the monk who is earnest<br/> we may expect that he will cultivate<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> that he will make much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how does the earnest monk<br/> cultivate and make much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is mindfulness,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is investigation of the Norm,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is energy,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is zest,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is tranquillity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is concentration,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is equanimity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk who is earnest<br/> cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>
