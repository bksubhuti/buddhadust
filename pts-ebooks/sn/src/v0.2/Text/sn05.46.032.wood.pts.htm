    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whatsoever conditions, monks,<br/> are the constituent parts of good and bad,<br/> but are on the side of goodness,<br/> all of them have their root in systematic attention,<br/> converge in systematic attention.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of those conditions<br/> systematic attention is reckoned chief.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of a monk who possesses systematic attention<br/> we may expect that he will cultivate<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> that he will make much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk<br/> who is possessed of systematic attention<br/> cultivate and make much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is mindfulness,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is investigation of the Norm,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is energy,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is zest,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is tranquillity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is concentration,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is equanimity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk<br/> who is possessed of systematic attention<br/> cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>
