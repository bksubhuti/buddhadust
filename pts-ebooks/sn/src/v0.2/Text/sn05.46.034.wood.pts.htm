    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> which are without check and hindrance,<br/> if cultivated and made much of<br/> with uncorrupted heart,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom which is mindfulness,<br/> if unrestrained by check and hindrance,<br/> if cultivated and made much of<br/> with uncorrupted heart,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom which is investigation of the Norm,<br/> if unrestrained by check and hindrance,<br/> if cultivated and made much of<br/> with uncorrupted heart,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom which is energy,<br/> if unrestrained by check and hindrance,<br/> if cultivated and made much of<br/> with uncorrupted heart,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom which is zest,<br/> if unrestrained by check and hindrance,<br/> if cultivated and made much of<br/> with uncorrupted heart,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom which is tranquillity,<br/> if unrestrained by check and hindrance,<br/> if cultivated and made much of<br/> with uncorrupted heart,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom which is concentration,<br/> if unrestrained by check and hindrance,<br/> if cultivated and made much of<br/> with uncorrupted heart,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom which is equanimity,<br/> if unrestrained by check and hindrance,<br/> if cultivated and made much of<br/> with uncorrupted heart,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> which if unrestrained by check and hindrance,<br/> if cultivated and made much of<br/> with uncorrupted heart,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>
