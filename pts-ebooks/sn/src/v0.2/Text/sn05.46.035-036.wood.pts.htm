    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also in him,<br/> who practises unsystematic attention,<br/> malevolence,<br/> if not already risen,<br/> arises:<br/> and, if already arisen,<br/> malevolence conduces<br/> to the more-becoming and growth thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also in him,<br/> who practises unsystematic attention,<br/> sloth and torpor,<br/> if not already risen,<br/> do arise:<br/> and, if arisen,<br/> sloth and torpor conduces<br/> to the more-becoming and growth thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also in him,<br/> who practises unsystematic attention,<br/> excitement and flurry,<br/> if not already risen,<br/> do arise:<br/> and, if already arisen,<br/> excitement and flurry conduces<br/> to the more-becoming and growth thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also in him,<br/> who practises unsystematic attention,<br/> doubt and wavering,<br/> if not already risen,<br/> do arise:<br/> and, if already arisen,<br/> doubt and wavering conduces<br/> to the more-becoming and growth thereof.</p>
