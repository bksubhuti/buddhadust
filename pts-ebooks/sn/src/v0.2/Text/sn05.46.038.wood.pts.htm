    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five checks,<br/> hindrances<br/> and corruptions of the heart,<br/> which weaken insight.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Sensual desire, monks, is a check,<br/> hindrance<br/> and corruption of the heart,<br/> that weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Malevolence, is a check,<br/> hindrance<br/> and corruption of the heart,<br/> that weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sloth and torpor, is a check,<br/> hindrance<br/> and corruption of the heart,<br/> that weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Excitement and flurry, is a check,<br/> hindrance<br/> and corruption of the heart,<br/> that weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Doubt and wavering, is a check,<br/> hindrance<br/> and corruption of the heart,<br/> that weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These five are checks,<br/> hindrances<br/> and corruptions of the heart,<br/> which weaken insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">The seven limbs of wisdom, monks,<br/> if unrestrained,<br/> unhindered,<br/> if cultivated<br/> and made much of<br/> with uncorrupted heart,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five hindrances at such time exist not?</p>

    <p class="f4">The hindrance that is sensual desire,<br/> at such time,<br/> exists not.</p>
