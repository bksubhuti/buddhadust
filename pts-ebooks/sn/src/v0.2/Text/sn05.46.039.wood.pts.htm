    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are mighty trees, monks,<br/> grown from tiny seeds,<br/> of mighty bulk,<br/> which overspread<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> (other) trees.</p>

    <p class="f4">The trees thus overspread<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> break up,<br/> break down,<br/> fall to the ground<br/> and so lie.</p>

    <p class="f4">What mighty trees, monks,<br/> grown from tiny seeds,<br/> of mighty bulk,<br/> which overspread other trees<br/> by which being overspread,<br/> break up,<br/> break down,<br/> fall to the ground<br/> and so lie?</p>

    <p class="f4">Trees such as the bo-tree,<br/> the banyan,<br/> the wave-leafed fig,<br/> the bunched fig,<br/> the cedar,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> the wood-apple tree.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">These are the mighty trees, monks,<br/> grown from tiny seeds,<br/> of mighty bulk,<br/> which overspread other trees:<br/> by which being overspread,<br/> break up,<br/> break down,<br/> fall to the ground<br/> and so lie.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br/> here maybe is such and such a clansman, who,<br/> whatsoever lusts he abandons<br/> and goes forth from home to the homeless,<br/> just by such lusts,<br/> or by lusts still worse than these,<br/> is broken up,<br/> broken down:<br/> down he falls<br/> and so lies.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, there are these five checks,<br/> hindrances<br/> which overspread the heart,<br/> which weaken insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">Sensual desire, monks, is a check,<br/> a hindrance<br/> which overspreads the heart<br/> and weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Malevolence, monks, is a check,<br/> a hindrance<br/> which overspreads the heart<br/> and weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Sloth and torpor, monks, is a check,<br/> a hindrance<br/> which overspreads the heart<br/> and weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Excitement and flurry, monks, is a check,<br/> a hindrance<br/> which overspreads the heart<br/> and weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Doubt and wavering, monks, is a check,<br/> a hindrance<br/> which overspreads the heart<br/> and weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Each of these, monks, is a check,<br/> a hindrance<br/> which overspreads the heart<br/> and weakens insight.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span> These seven limbs of wisdom, monks,<br/> which are without check and hindrance,<br/> which overspread not the heart,<br/> if cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits<br/> of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> which is without check and hindrance,<br/> which overspreads not the heart,<br/> which, if cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduces to the realization<br/> of the fruits of liberation by knowledge;</p>

    <p class="f4">the limb of wisdom which is equanimity,<br/> which is without check and hindrance,<br/> which overspreads not the heart,<br/> which, if cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduces to the realization<br/> of the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the seven limbs of wisdom, monks,<br/> which are without check and hindrance,<br/> which overspread not the heart,<br/> if cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to realizing the fruits<br/> of liberation by knowledge.</p>
