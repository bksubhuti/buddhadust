    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, there are these five hindrances<br/> which cause blindness,<br/> loss of sight<br/> and ignorance;<br/> which obstruct insight,<br/> consort with pain<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> and conduce not to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Which five?</p>
