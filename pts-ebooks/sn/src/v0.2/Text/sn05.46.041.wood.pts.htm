    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> in past times<br/> have abandoned the three conceits,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> all of them <span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span> did so<br/> by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> in future times<br/> shall abandon the three conceits,<br/> all of them will do so<br/> by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses or brahmins, monks,<br/> do now<br/> abandon the three conceits,<br/> all of them do so<br/> by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> in past times<br/> have abandoned the three conceits,<br/> all of them did so<br/> by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/> these seven limbs of wisdom.</p>
