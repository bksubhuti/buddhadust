    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, together with the appearance of a monarch who rolls the wheel<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> there is the appearance of the seven treasures.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven treasures?</p>

    <p class="f4">The treasure of the Wheel,<br/> the treasure of the Elephant,<br/> the treasure of the Horse,<br/> the treasure of the Jewel,<br/> the treasure of the Woman,<br/> the treasure of the Housefather,<br/> the treasure of the Heir Apparent.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the seven treasures that appear<br/> along with the appearance of a monarch who rolls the wheel.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise, monks, together with the appearance of a Tathāgata who is Arahant, a fully Enlightened One,<br/> there is the appearance of these seven treasures.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">There is the appearance of the seven treasures of wisdom;<br/> the treasure of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the treasure of wisdom that is searching the Norm,<br/> the treasure of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the treasure of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the treasure of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the treasure of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the treasure of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, together with the appearance of a Tathāgata who is Arahant, a fully Enlightened One,<br/> there is the appearance of these seven treasures of wisdom.</p>
