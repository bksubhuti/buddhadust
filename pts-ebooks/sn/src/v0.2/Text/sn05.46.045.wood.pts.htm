    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now a certain brother came to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side<br/> he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Intelligent, no imbecile!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Intelligent, no imbecile!'<br/> is the saying, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far is this name applicable?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"By the fact, monk, of cultivating,<br/> and making much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> one is called 'Intelligent, no imbecile.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> the limb of wisdom that is equanimity."</p>

    <p class="f4">"By the fact, monk, of cultivating,<br/> and making much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> one is called 'Intelligent, no imbecile.'</p>
