    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"As a matter concerning the outside,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> monks,<br/> I see no other single factor<br/> so potent for the arising of the seven limbs of wisdom as<br/> friendship with what is lovely.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of a monk who is a friend what is lovely<br/> we may expect that he will cultivate<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> that he will make much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how does a monk<br/> who is a friend of what is lovely<br/> cultivate and make much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is mindfulness,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is investigation of the Norm,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is energy,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is zest,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is tranquillity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is concentration,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is equanimity,<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk,<br/> who is a friend of what is lovely<br/> cultivates and makes much of<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom."</p>
