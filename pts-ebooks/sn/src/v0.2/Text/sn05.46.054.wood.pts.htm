    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Koliyans,<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> at Haliddavasana,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> a township of the Koliyans.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a great number of monks,<br/> robing themselves in the forenoon<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe,<br/> entered Haliddavasana for alms.</p>

    <p class="f4">And it occurred to those monks thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">How if we paid a visit to the Park of the Wanderers of other viws?"</p>

    <p class="f4">So those monks did so,<br/> and on reaching them<br/> courteously greeted those Wanderers of other views,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/> they sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One replied:</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus questioned, monks,<br/> the Wanderers of other views<br/> will be unable to explain themselves,<br/> and further will come to an ill pass.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/> that is mindfulness<br/> accompanied by equanimity<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm,<br/> accompanied by equanimity<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> accompanied by compassion<br/> which is based on equanimity,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> accompanied by equanimity<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> accompanied by equanimity<br/> which is based on seclusion,<br/> on dispassion,<br/> on cessation,<br/> which ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he desires:</p>

    <p class="f4">Avoiding both the repugnant<br/> and the non-repugnant,<br/> let me abide indifferent,<br/> mindful<br/> and self-possessed;<br/> he so abides<br/> avoiding both the repugnant<br/> and the non-repugnant<br/> indifferent,<br/> mindful<br/> and self-possessed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, passing utterly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/> he attains and abides in the sphere<br/> wherein he is conscious<br/> of the existence of nothing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, the heart's release by equanimity<br/> has for its excellence<br/> the sphere wherein nought exists.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein there is insight<br/> for the monk who has not penetrated to a further release.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>
