    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the brahmin Saṅgārava<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of civil courtesies,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the brahmin Sangarava said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is the reason, Master Gotama,<br/> what is the cause<br/> why the chants which I once learned by heart for many days<br/> do not recur to me,<br/> not to speak of those I have not learned by heart.</p>
