    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, on the hill Vulture's Peak.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Prince Abhaya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Prince Abhava said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, Pūraṇa Kassapa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> says this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is no condition,<br/> there is no cause<br/> of not knowing and not seeing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not knowing<br/> and not seeing<br/> are without condition,<br/> without cause.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no condition,<br/> there is no cause<br/> of knowing and seeing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Knowing and seeing<br/> are without condition,<br/> without cause."</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein what says the Exalted One?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is condition, prince,<br/> there is cause<br/> of not knowing,<br/> of not seeing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not knowing<br/> and not seeing<br/> have a condition,<br/> have a cause.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is indeed a condition, prince,<br/> there is indeed a cause<br/> of knowing<br/> of seeing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Knowing and seeing<br/> have a condition,<br/> have a cause."</p>

    <p class="f4">"At such time, prince,<br/> as one dwells with heart<br/> possessed and overwhelmed<br/> by sensual lust,<br/> and knows not,<br/> sees not<br/> in very truth<br/> any refuge from sensual lust that has arisen, -<br/> this, prince, is the cause<br/> of not knowing,<br/> of not seeing.</p>
