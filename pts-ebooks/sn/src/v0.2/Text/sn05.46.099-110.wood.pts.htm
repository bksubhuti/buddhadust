    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, the river Ganges,<br/> that flows,<br/> slides<br/> and tends towards the east,<br/> and there comes a great crowd of folk,<br/> armed with pick and basket, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'We will make this river Ganges<br/> flow,<br/> slide<br/> and tend towards the west.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What think ye, monks?</p>

    <p class="f4">Would that great crowd of folk<br/> make the river Ganges<br/> flow,<br/> slide<br/> and tend towards the west?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Because, lord, the river Ganges<br/> flows,<br/> slides<br/> and tends towards the east,<br/> it were no easy thing<br/> to make it flow,<br/> slide<br/> and tend towards the west;<br/> insomuch that fatigue and vexation<br/> would be the lot<br/> of that great crowd of folk."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just so, monks, if the rajah's royal ministers<br/> or his friends<br/> or boon companions<br/> or kinsmen<br/> or blood relatives<br/> were to come to a monk<br/> who is cultivating and making much of the Ariyan eightfold way,<br/> and were to seek to entice him with wealth, saying:</p>
