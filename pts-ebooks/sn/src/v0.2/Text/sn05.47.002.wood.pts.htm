    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Vesālī, in Ambapālī's Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord" replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"A monk should dwell mindful and composed.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is our instruction to you.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how does a monk dwell mindful?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells as regards body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is a monk mindful.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how is a monk composed?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk, in his going forth<br/> and in his returning,<br/> acts composedly.</p>

    <p class="f4">In looking in front<br/> and looking behind<br/> he acts composedly.</p>

    <p class="f4">In bending<br/> or relaxing (his limbs)<br/> he acts composedly.</p>

    <p class="f4">In wearing his robe<br/> and in bearing bowl and outer robe<br/> he acts composedly.</p>

    <p class="f4">In eating,<br/> drinking,<br/> chewing<br/> and tasting<br/> he acts composedly.</p>

    <p class="f4">In easing himself,<br/> in going,<br/> standing,<br/> sitting,<br/> in sleeping,<br/> waking,<br/> in speaking<br/> and keeping silence<br/> he acts composedly.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus is a monk composed.</p>

    <p class="f4">A monk should dwell mindful and composed, monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is our instruction to you."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
