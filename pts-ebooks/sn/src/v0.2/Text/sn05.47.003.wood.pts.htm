    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain monk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came to visit the Exalted One<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/> that monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine in brief,<br/> such that, on hearing it,<br/> I might dwell remote,<br/> earnest,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring."</p>

    <p class="f4">"And thus maybe some silly fellows<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> here<br/> may inquire of me,<br/> and when I preach them doctrine<br/> they may think it worth their while<br/> to follow after me."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let my lord the Exalted One teach me doctrine in brief!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let the Happy One teach me doctrine in brief!</p>

    <p class="f4">Surely I could understand the meaning<br/> of the Exalted One's words!</p>

    <p class="f4">Surely I should become an heir<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> to the Exalted One's words!"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, monk, you must purify the rudiments in good states.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And what are the rudiments in good states?</p>

    <p class="f4">They are virtue that is truly pure,<br/> and straight view.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monk, when your virtue shall be truly pure<br/> and your view straight,<br/> thenceforward, monk,<br/> leaning on virtue,<br/> established in virtue,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> you can cultivate the four stations of mindfulness<br/> in a threefold way.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monk, as regards your own self,<br/> in body contemplating body (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, as regards externals,<br/> in body contemplating body (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, both as regards your own self<br/> and as regards externals,<br/> in body contemplating body (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Next, <span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span> as regards your own self,<br/> in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, as regards externals,<br/> in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, both as regards your own self<br/> and as regards externals,<br/> in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, as regards your own self,<br/> in mind contemplating mind (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, as regards externals,<br/> in mind contemplating mind (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, both as regards your own self<br/> and as regards externals,<br/> in mind contemplating mind (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, as regards your own self,<br/> in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, as regards externals,<br/> in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Or, both as regards your own self<br/> and as regards externals,<br/> in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient)<br/> do you abide ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monk, when you,<br/> leaning on virtue,<br/> established in virtue,<br/> shall have cultivated<br/> these four stations of mindfulness<br/> in this threefold manner,<br/> then, monk, you may look for that growth in good states<br/> which shall come to you,<br/> whether by night or by day,<br/> and not for falling away in good states."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon that monk was delighted with the words of the Exalted One,<br/> and was glad of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he rose up,<br/> saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">And that monk,<br/> dwelling solitary,<br/> remote,<br/> earnest,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> in no long time<br/> attained that goal<br/> for which the clansmen rightly leave home<br/> for the homeless,<br/> even that unrivalled goal of right living, -<br/> attained it even in this very life,<br/> and knowing it for himself,<br/> realizing it for himself,<br/> abode therein,<br/> so that he came to know:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for me there is no more of being here."</p>

    <p class="f4">And that monk was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
