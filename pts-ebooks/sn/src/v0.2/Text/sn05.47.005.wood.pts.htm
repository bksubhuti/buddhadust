    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'"A heap of demerit," monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">If any one should thus name<br/> the five hindrances,<br/> rightly would he do so:<br/> for indeed one entire mass of demerit<br/> are the five hindrances.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The hindrance of sensual desire,</p>

    <p class="f4">the hindrance of malevolence,</p>

    <p class="f4">the hindrance of sloth and torpor,</p>

    <p class="f4">the hindrance of excitement and flurry,</p>

    <p class="f4">the hindrance of doubt and wavering.</p>

    <p class="f4">"A heap of demerit," monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">If any one should thus name them, rightly would he do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">"A heap of merit," monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">If any one should thus name<br/> the four stations of mindfulness,<br/> rightly would he do so:<br/> for indeed one entire mass of merit<br/> are the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from covetousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk abides in feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from covetousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk abides in mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from covetousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk abides in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from covetousness.</p>

    <p class="f4">In- <span class="f2 g"><b>[125]</b></span> deed, monks,<br/> if one named the four stations of mindfulness<br/> "a heap of merit,"<br/> rightly would he so name them:<br/> for one entire mass of merit<br/> are these four stations of mindfulness.'</p>
