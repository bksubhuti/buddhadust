    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"In Himalaya, king of mountains, monks,<br/> there is a tract of land<br/> that is rough and hard to cross,<br/> where neither monkeys nor humans do resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise there is a tract of land<br/> where monkeys do resort,<br/> but not humans.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are tracts, monks, in Himalaya,<br/> tracts of level country,<br/> delightful spots,<br/> where both monkeys and humans do resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">In those spots, monks,<br/> a hunter<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> sets a trap of pitch<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">13</a></sup></span><br/> in the monkeys' tracks<br/> to catch the monkeys.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now those monkeys who are free from folly and greed,<br/> on seeing that pitch-trap<br/> keep far away from it.</p>

    <p class="f4">But a greedy, foolish monkey<br/> comes up to the pitch<br/> and handles it with one paw,<br/> and his paw sticks fast in it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, thinking:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I'll free my paw,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he seizes it with the other paw:<br/> but that too sticks fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">To free both paws<br/> he seizes them with one foot,<br/> and that too sticks fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">To free both paws<br/> and the one foot,<br/> he lays hold of them<br/> with the other foot:<br/> but that too sticks fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">To free both paws and both feet<br/> he lays hold of them<br/> with his muzzle:<br/> but that too sticks fast.</p>

    <p class="f4">So that monkey<br/> thus trapped in five ways<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> lies down and howls,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> thus fallen on misfortune,<br/> fallen on ruin,<br/> a prey for the hunter,<br/> to work his will upon him.</p>

    <p class="f4">So the hunter spits him<br/> and prepares him (for eating) there and then<br/> over a charcoal fire,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> and goes off at his pleasure.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so it is, monks,<br/> with one who roams in wrong pastures<br/> that belong to others.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore do not ye so roam.</p>

    <p class="f4">For to <span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span> those, monks, who so roam<br/> Māra gets access,<br/> Māra gets opportunity.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is not one's own range,<br/> but belongs to others?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the five sensual elements.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">There are, monks, objects cognizable by the eye,<br/> objects desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are sounds cognizable by the ear<br/> sounds desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are scents cognizable by the nose<br/> scents desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are savours cognizable by the tongue<br/> savours desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">There are tangibles cognizable by the body<br/> tangibles desirable,<br/> pleasant,<br/> delightful<br/> and dear,<br/> passion-fraught,<br/> inciting to lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is not one's own range<br/> but belongs to others.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye range your own pasture-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Keep to your own native beat.</p>

    <p class="f4">To those who range their own pasture-ground,<br/> who keep their own native beat,<br/> Māra gets no access,<br/> Māra gets no opportunity of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is a monk's own pasture-ground?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is his own native beat?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells as regards body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is a monk's own pasture-ground,<br/> this is his native beat.</p>
