    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, a foolish,<br/> inexperienced,<br/> unskilful cook<br/> of rājahs or royal ministers,<br/> put in charge of the various sorts of soup,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> to wit:<br/> soups to be classified as sour,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> bitter,<br/> pungent,<br/> sweet,<br/> alkaline,<br/> non-alkaline,<br/> salty<br/> or otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, that foolish,<br/> inexperienced,<br/> unskilful cook<br/> does not take proper note<span class="f3"><sup>4</sup></span> of his master's<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> taste,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Today my <span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span> master likes this soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'he reaches out for that,'<br/> or<br/> 'he takes a good helping of this,'<br/> or<br/> 'he praises this one';</p>

    <p class="f4">'today master likes sour soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he reaches out<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> for sour soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he takes a good helping of sour soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he praises sour soup;'</p>

    <p class="f4">'today master likes bitter soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he reaches out for bitter soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he takes a good helping of bitter soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he praises bitter soup;'</p>

    <p class="f4">'today master likes alkaline soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he reaches out for alkaline soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he takes a good helping of alkaline soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he praises alkaline soup;'</p>

    <p class="f4">'today master likes non-alkaline soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he reaches out for non-alkaline soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he takes a good helping of non-alkaline soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he praises non-alkaline soup;'</p>

    <p class="f4">'today master likes salty soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he reaches out for salty soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he takes a good helping of salty soup,'<br/> or<br/> 'today he praises salty soup;'</p>

    <p class="f4">In each case he does not take note<br/> of his masters likes and dislikes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore, monks, that foolish,<br/> inexperienced,<br/> unskilful cook<br/> gets no perquisites of clothing<br/> or gratuities<br/> or offerings.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, monks, that foolish,<br/> inexperienced,<br/> unskilful cook<br/> does not take note of his master's tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br/> here some foolish,<br/> inexperienced,<br/> unskilful monk<br/> abides in body contemplating body<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed,<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting,<br/> but, though he abides in body contemplating body,<br/> his mind is not concentrated,<br/> the corruptions<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> of mind are not abandoned,<br/> he takes no proper note of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">He abides in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed,<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting,<br/> but, though he abides in feelings contemplating feelings,<br/> his mind is not concentrated,<br/> the corruptions of mind are not abandoned,<br/> he takes no proper note of that.</p>

    <p class="f4">But suppose, monks, that there is a wise,<br/> experienced,<br/> skilful cook<br/> of rajahs or royal ministers,<br/> put in charge of the various sorts of soup,<br/> to wit:<br/> soups to be classified as sour,<br/> bitter,<br/> pungent,<br/> sweet,<br/> alkaline,<br/> non-alkaline,<br/> salty<br/> or otherwise.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span> Thus, monks, that wise,<br/> experienced,<br/> skilful cook<br/> takes proper note of his master's tastes,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Well, monks, that wise,<br/> experienced,<br/> skilful cook<br/> has perquisites of clothing,<br/> gratuities<br/> and offerings.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because the wise fellow studies his master's tastes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br/> here we may have some wise,<br/> experienced,<br/> skilful monk.</p>

    <p class="f4">He abides in body contemplating body (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed,<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus abides in body contemplating body,<br/> his mind is concentrated,<br/> the corruptions are abandoned,<br/> he takes proper note of that matter.</p>
