    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br/> robing himself in the forenoon<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe,<br/> went to visit a certain settlement of nuns,<br/> and on reaching them<br/> sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of nuns came to see the venerable Ānanda,<br/> and on reaching him,<br/> saluted the venerable Ānanda<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/> those nuns said this<br/> to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are here dwelling, lord Ānanda,<br/> a number of nuns<br/> with their minds well established<br/> in the four stations of mindfulness,<br/> and they have attained<br/> to greater excellence of comprehension than before.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"So it is, sisters.</p>

    <p class="f4">So it is, sisters.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever,<br/> be it monk or nun,<br/> dwells with mind well established<br/> in the four stations of mindfulness,<br/> such may be expected to attain<br/> to greater excellence of comprehension than before."</p>

    <p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda,<br/> after instructing those nuns<br/> with a talk about doctrine,<br/> having roused,<br/> incited<br/> and gladdened them,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> rose up and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br/> after going his begging round in Sāvatthī<br/> and having returned and eaten his meal,<br/> went to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/> the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, here (in Sāvatthī) robing myself in the forenoon<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe,<br/> I went to visit a certain settlement of nuns,<br/> and on reaching them<br/> sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of nuns came to see me,<br/> and on reaching me,<br/> saluted me<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/> those nuns said this<br/> to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There are here dwelling, lord Ānanda,<br/> a number <span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span> of nuns<br/> with their minds well established<br/> in the four stations of mindfulness,<br/> and they have attained<br/> to greater excellence of comprehension than before.'</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words, lord, I said to those nuns:</p>

    <p class="f4">'So it is, sisters.</p>

    <p class="f4">So it is, sisters.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever,<br/> be it monk or nun,<br/> dwells with mind well established<br/> in the four stations of mindfulness,<br/> such may be expected to attain<br/> to greater excellence of comprehension than before.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"So it is, Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">So it is, Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever,<br/> be it monk or nun,<br/> dwells with mind well established<br/> in the four stations of mindfulness<br/> shall so attain<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> to greater excellence of comprehension than before.</p>

    <p class="f4">In what four stations?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, a monk dwells in body contemplating body (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus abides in body contemplating body,<br/> either some bodily object arises,<br/> or bodily discomfort<br/> or drowsiness of mind<br/> scatters his thoughts abroad to externals.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon, Ānanda,<br/> his attention should be directed<br/> to some pleasurable object of thought.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus directs it<br/> to some pleasurable object of thought,<br/> delight springs up in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him, thus delighted,<br/> arises zest.</p>

    <p class="f4">Full of zest<br/> his body is calmed down.</p>

    <p class="f4">With body so calmed<br/> he experiences ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">The mind of one at ease<br/> is concentrated.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He thus reflects:</p>

    <p class="f4">The aim on which I set my mind<br/> I have attained.</p>

    <p class="f4">Come,<br/> let me withdraw my mind<br/> (from the pleasurable object of thought).</p>

    <p class="f4">So he withdraws his mind therefrom,<br/> and neither starts<br/> nor carries on<br/> thought-process.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he is fully conscious:</p>

    <p class="f4">I am without thought<br/> initial or sustained.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am inwardly mindful.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am at ease.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Ānanda,<br/> a monk abides in feelings contemplating feelings,<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus abides in feelings contemplating feelings,<br/> either some bodily object arises,<br/> or bodily discomfort<br/> or drowsiness of mind<br/> scatters his thoughts abroad to externals.</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Ānanda, is the practice<br/> for the non-direction of mind?</p>

    <p class="f4">A monk, by not directing his mind<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> to externals,<br/> is fully aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My mind is not directed to externals.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he is fully aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My mind is not concentrated<br/> either on what is before<br/> or on what is behind,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/> but it is set free,<br/> it is undirected.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he is fully aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'In body contemplating body I abide,<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am at ease.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, by not directing his mind to externals,<br/> he is fully aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he is fully aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My mind is not concentrated<br/> either on what is before<br/> or on what is behind,<br/> but it is set free,<br/> it is undirected.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he is fully aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">I am at ease.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, by not directing his mind to externals,<br/> he is fully aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My mind is not directed to externals.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he is fully aware:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My mind is not concentrated<br/> either on what is before<br/> or on what is behind,<br/> but it is set free,<br/> it is undirected.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the practice<br/> for the non-direction of mind.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I shown you these two practices, -<br/> that for the direction of mind,<br/> and that for the non-direction of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever, Ānanda, should be done by a teacher<br/> who seeks the welfare of his disciples,<br/> in compassion,<br/> feeling compassion<br/> have I done that for you.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Here, Ānanda, are the roots of trees.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here are empty places. <span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye meditate.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be not remiss.</p>

    <p class="f4">Be not remorseful hereafter.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is our instruction to you."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>
