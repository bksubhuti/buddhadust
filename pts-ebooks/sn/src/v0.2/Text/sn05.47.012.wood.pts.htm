    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Nālandā,<span class="f3"><sup>1</sup></span> in Cloth-seller's Mango Grove.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated the venerable Sāriputta said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, I have such faith in the Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">There never was, methinks,<br/> nor shall be,<br/> nor is there now existing<br/> anyone, whether recluse or brahmin,<br/> who is greater<br/> or more accomplished,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> that is, in the higher wisdom!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Splendid,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> indeed, Sāriputta,<br/> is your bull-like utterance,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">You have laid hold of certainty.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">You have uttered a lion's roar,<br/> in saying as you do,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord I have such faith in the Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">There never was, methinks,<br/> nor shall be,<br/> nor is there now existing<br/> anyone, whether recluse or brahmin,<br/> who is greater<br/> or more accomplished;<br/> that is, in the higher wisdom!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Come now, Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">Those who in past time were Arahants,<br/> fully Enlightened Ones, -<br/> pray, have you seen<br/> mind to mind<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> with all those Exalted Ones<br/> (so as to say of them):</p>

    <p class="f4">'Such was the virtue of those Exalted Ones,<br/> such the teachings of those Exalted Ones,<br/> such their wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus they dwelt<br/> and thus those Exalted Ones were released'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span> Then again, Sāriputta,<br/> those who shall be Arahants,<br/> fully Enlightened Ones<br/> in future times, -<br/> pray, have you seen<br/> mind to mind<br/> with all those Exalted Ones,<br/> so as to say of them:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Such was the virtue of those Exalted Ones,<br/> such the teachings of those Exalted Ones,<br/> such their wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus they dwelt<br/> and thus those Exalted Ones were released'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Again, Sāriputta,<br/> he who is now Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One, -<br/> pray, is he seen<br/> mind to mind<br/> by you (so that you can say of him):</p>

    <p class="f4">'Such is the virtue of the Exalted One,<br/> such his teaching,<br/> such his wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus and thus he dwells,<br/> thus is that Exalted One released'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"So then, Sāriputta,<br/> in this matter<br/> you have no power of seeing<br/> mind to mind<br/> with these Arahants,<br/> these fully Enlightened Ones,<br/> whether in past or future or present time.</p>

    <p class="f4">What then, Sāriputta,<br/> is the meaning of your splendid bull like utterance,<br/> your laying hold of certainty,<br/> your uttering of the lion's roar,<br/> in saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, I have such faith in the Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">There never was, methinks,<br/> nor shall be,<br/> nor is there now existing<br/> anyone, whether recluse or brahmin,<br/> who is greater<br/> or more accomplished;<br/> that is, in the higher wisdom'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"True it is, lord,<br/> as to those Arahants,<br/> those fully Enlightened Ones,<br/> whether in time past or future or present,<br/> I have no power of seeing<br/> mind to mind with them.</p>

    <p class="f4">I only infer<br/> from my knowledge<br/> which is in accordance with the Norm.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, lord, there is a border town<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> with strong foundations,<br/> strong walls and towers,<br/> but a single gate,<br/> and over that is set a warden,<br/> wise,<br/> shrewd<br/> and watchful,<br/> who keeps out strangers<br/> and welcomes friends.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he patrols all round that town<br/> in order due<br/> he might not mark a crevice in the <span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span> wall<br/> or a hole just big enough for a cat to slip through,<br/> but he would think:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Whatsoever creatures of any size<br/> enter this town<br/> or go out therefrom,<br/> all of them must enter<br/> or go out<br/> by this same gate.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, lord, is my inference<br/> from knowledge in accordance with the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">Those, lord, who in time past were Arahants,<br/> fully Enlightened Ones, -<br/> all of those Exalted Ones,<br/> by abandoning the five hindrances,<br/> those corruptions of the heart<br/> that weaken insight,<br/> being well established<br/> in the four stations of mindfulness,<br/> by cultivating in very truth<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> did attain enlightenment<br/> in the unsurpassed perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">They, lord, who in future time,<br/> will be fully Enlightened Ones, -<br/> all of those Exalted Ones,<br/> by abandoning the five hindrances,<br/> those corruptions of the heart<br/> that weaken insight,<br/> being well established<br/> in the four stations of mindfulness,<br/> by cultivating in very truth<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> will attain enlightenment<br/> in the unsurpassed perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One, lord,<br/> who even now is Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> by abandoning the five hindrances,<br/> those corruptions of the heart<br/> which weaken insight,<br/> he, well established<br/> in the four stations of mindfulness,<br/> by cultivating in very truth<br/> the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/> is enlightened with the unsurpassed perfect wisdom."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, Sāriputta,<br/> you should repeat this Norm-teaching<br/> again and again<br/> to monks and nuns,<br/> to disciples,<br/> both men and women;<br/> and whatsoever silly fellows<br/> have any doubt or perplexity about the Tathāgata,<br/> when they hear my method of Norm-teaching,<br/> all such doubt and perplexity<br/> shall be abandoned.'</p>
