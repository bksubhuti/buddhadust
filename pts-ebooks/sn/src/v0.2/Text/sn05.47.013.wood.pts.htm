    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion the venerable Sāriputta was staying <span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span> among the Magadhese<br/> at Nālagāmaka,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> being sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> stricken with a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Cunda the novice was in attendance<br/> on the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">And it was owing to this sickness<br/> that the venerable Sāriputta passed away.</p>

    <p class="f4">So Cunda the novice,<br/> taking the venerable Sāriputta's bowl and outer robe,<br/> went to Sāvatthī,<br/> to Jeta Grove,<br/> and so to Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/> where he went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/> Cunda the novice said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, the venerable Sāriputta has passed away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here are his bowl and outer robe.</p>

    <p class="f4">[This water-strainer holds his relics.]"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend Cunda, this piece of news<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> will be an excuse for seeing the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let us go, friend Cunda,<br/> to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and when we get there<br/> we will tell him about this matter."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very good, sir," said Cunda the novice<br/> in reply to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda<br/> and Cunda the novice<br/> went to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As they thus sat<br/> the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, this Cunda the novice said to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sir, the venerable Sāriputta has passed away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here are his bowl and outer robe.</p>

    <p class="f4">This water-strainer holds his relics.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, lord, thereat<br/> my body was as if drugged.</p>

    <p class="f4">My bearings were confused.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span> The teachings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> were not clear to me<br/> when I heard the words<br/> 'the venerable Sāriputta has passed away.'"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But tell me, Ānanda,<br/> when the venerable Sāriputta passed away,<br/> did he take with him<br/> the constituents of virtue;<br/> did he take with him<br/> the constituents of concentration;<br/> did he take with him<br/> the constituents of wisdom;<br/> did he take with him<br/> the constituents of release;<br/> did he take with him<br/> the constituents of release by knowing and seeing?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Nay, lord, when the venerable Sāriputta passed away<br/> he did not take with him the constituents of virtue;<br/> he did not take with him<br/> the constituents of concentration;<br/> he did not take with him<br/> the constituents of wisdom;<br/> he did not take with him<br/> the constituents of release;<br/> he did not take with him<br/> the constituents of release by knowing and seeing."</p>

    <p class="f4">But he was to me an adviser,<br/> one who was well grounded.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He was an instructor,<br/> one who could arouse,<br/> incite<br/> and gladden.</p>

    <p class="f4">He was unwearied in teaching the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">He was the patron<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/> of those who lived the righteous life along with him.</p>

    <p class="f4">We bear in mind<br/> that essence of the Norm,<br/> that patronage of the Norm<br/> possessed by the venerable Sāriputta, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Have I not afore time<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/> declared to you this, Ānanda, - <span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span> how in all things that are dear and delightful<br/> there is the nature of diversity,<br/> the nature of separation,<br/> the nature of otherness?</p>

    <p class="f4">How is it possible, Ānanda,<br/> in the case of what is born,<br/> what is become,<br/> what is compounded,<br/> what is transitory, -<br/> how is it possible<br/> to have one's wish fulfilled:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Oh! may it not perish'?</p>

    <p class="f4">Nay, such a thing cannot be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, Ānanda, from some mighty tree,<br/> standing firm and full of vigour<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/> one of the greater limbs rots off, -<br/> even so, Ānanda, from the mighty Order of monks,<br/> standing firm and full of vigour,<br/> Sāriputta has passed away.</p>

    <p class="f4">How is it possible, Ānanda,<br/> I say,<br/> in the case of what is born,<br/> what is become,<br/> what is compounded,<br/> what is transitory, -<br/> how is it possible<br/> that one's wish can be fulfilled:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Oh! may it not perish'?</p>

    <p class="f4">Nay, such a thing cannot be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda,<br/> do ye abide grounded on self,<br/> self-refuged,<br/> taking refuge in none other.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye abide grounded on the Norm,<br/> taking refuge in the Norm,<br/> having none other refuge.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, Ānanda,<br/> does a monk so abide?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda,<br/> a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Ānanda, is how a monk abides grounded on self,<br/> self-refuged,<br/> taking refuge in none other.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso, Ānanda,<br/> either now<br/> or when I have passed away,<br/> shall abide grounded on self,<br/> self-refuged,<br/> taking refuge in none other;<br/> grounded on the Norm,<br/> with the Norm for refuge,<br/> taking refuge in none other, -<br/> they, Ānanda,<br/> shall be my monks,<br/> they shall be atop of the gloom;<br/> that is,<br/> they who are anxious to learn."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>
