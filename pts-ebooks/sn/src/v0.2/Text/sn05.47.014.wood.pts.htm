    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Vajjians<br/> at Ukkāvela<br/> on the river Ganges<br/> together with a great company <span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span> of monks,<br/> not long after the passing away of Sāriputta and Moggallāna the Great.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the Exalted One was seated in the open air,<br/> surrounded by the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/> observing that the Order of monks was become silent,<br/> thus addressed the monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, truly this company seems empty.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have passed away<br/> my company is empty of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is indifferent<br/> as to that quarter<br/> in which Sāriputta and Moggallāna are dwelling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whosoever in past times<br/> have been Arahants,<br/> fully Enlightened Ones, -<br/> each one of those Exalted Ones<br/> had such a noble pair of disciples<br/> as were Sāriputta and Moggallāna to me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whosoever in future times<br/> shall be Arahants,<br/> fully Enlightened Ones,<br/> each of them shall have such a noble pair of disciples<br/> as were Sāriputta and Moggallāna to me.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">A wonder of disciples it is, monks!</p>

    <p class="f4">A marvel of disciples it is, monks!</p>

    <p class="f4">To think how they carry out the Master's teachings,<br/> how they give advice accordantly,<br/> how dear to the fourfold company,<br/> how delightful,<br/> how revered and sought after they must be.</p>

    <p class="f4">A wonder it is, monks!</p>

    <p class="f4">A marvel it is, monks,<br/> in the Tathāgata!</p>

    <p class="f4">For though such a pair of disciples has passed away,<br/> there is in the Tathāgata<br/> no sorrow<br/> or lamenting.</p>

    <p class="f4">How is it possible, monks,<br/> in the case of what is born,<br/> what is become,<br/> what is compounded,<br/> what is transitory, -<br/> how is it possible to have one's wish fulfilled:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Oh I may it not perish'?</p>

    <p class="f4">Nay, such a thing cannot be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if, monks, from some mighty tree,<br/> standing firm<br/> and full of vigour,<br/> the greater limbs should rot away:</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so monks,<br/> from the mighty Order of monks,<br/> standing firm<br/> and full of vigour,<br/> Sāriputta and Moggallāna have passed away.</p>

    <p class="f4">How is it possible, I say,<br/> in the case if what is born,<br/> what is become,<br/> what is compounded,<br/> what is transitory, -<br/> how is it <span class="f2 g"><b>[145]</b></span> possible to have one's wish fulfilled:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Oh! may it not perish!'?</p>

    <p class="f4">Nay, such a thing cannot be.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks,<br/> do ye abide grounded on self,<br/> self-refuged,<br/> taking refuge in none other.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye abide grounded on the Norm,<br/> taking refuge in the Norm,<br/> having none other refuge.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks,<br/> does a monk so abide?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks,<br/> a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk abides grounded on self,<br/> self-refuged,<br/> taking refuge in none other.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever, monks,<br/> either now<br/> or when I have passed away,<br/> shall abide grounded on self,<br/> self-refuged,<br/> taking refuge in none other;<br/> grounded on the Norm,<br/> with the Norm for refuge,<br/> taking refuge in none other, -<br/> they, monks,<br/> shall be my monks,<br/> they shall be atop of the gloom;<br/> that is,<br/> they who are anxious to learn."</p>
