    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Uttiya came to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Uttiya said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for me, lord,<br/> if the Exalted One would teach me<br/> a teaching in brief,<br/> hearing which teaching from the Exalted One<br/> I might dwell solitary,<br/> remote,<br/> earnest,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring."</p>

    <p class="f4">"In such case, Uttiya,<br/> you must purify the rudiments in good states.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what are the rudiments in good states?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is virtue<br/> that is truly pure<br/> and straight view.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Uttiya, when your virtue shall be truly pure<br/> and your view straight,<br/> thenceforward,<br/> leaning on virtue,<br/> established in virtue,<br/> you can cultivate the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein Uttiya, do you abide in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abide in feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abide in mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Abide in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, Uttiya, when you,<br/> leaning on virtue,<br/> established in virtue,<br/> shall have thus cultivated<br/> the four stations of mindfulness,<br/> thenceforward, Uttiya,<br/> you shall pass beyond the realm of death<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Uttiya was delighted with the words of the Exalted One<br/> and was glad of them.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he rose up,<br/> saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Uttiya,<br/> dwelling solitary and remote,<br/> earnest,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> in no long time<br/> attained that goal<br/> for which the clansmen rightly leave home<br/> for the homeless,<br/> even that unrivalled goal of righteous living,<br/> attained in even this very life:<br/> and, knowing it for himself,<br/> realizing it for himself,<br/> abode therein,<br/> so that he came to know:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lived is the righteous life.</p>

    <p class="f4">Done is what I had to do.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Uttiya was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
