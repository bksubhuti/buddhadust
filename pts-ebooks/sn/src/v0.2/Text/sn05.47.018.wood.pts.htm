    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Uruvelā,<br/> on the bank of the river Nerañjarā, under the Goatherds' Banyan,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> after he had just attained enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, as the Exalted One meditated in solitude,<br/> there arose in his mind<br/> this train of thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the one sole way<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> that leads to the purification of beings,<br/> to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br/> to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br/> to the winning of the Method,<br/> to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/> to wit:<br/> the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">A monk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> should dwell in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the one sole way<br/> that leads to the purification of beings,<br/> to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br/> to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br/> to the winning of the Method,<br/> to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/> to wit:<br/> the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Brahma Sahampati,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> reading with his mind<br/> the mind of the Exalted One,<br/> just as a strong man might stretch out <span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span> his bent arm,<br/> or draw in his arm stretched out, -<br/> even so did Brahmā Sahampati vanish from the Brahma World<br/> and appear before the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then drawing his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/> joining his hands<br/> he raised them to the Exalted One and said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus it is, Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is, O Happy One!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the one sole way<br/> that leads to the purification of beings,<br/> to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br/> to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br/> to the winning of the Method,<br/> to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/> to wit:<br/> the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">A monk should dwell in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke Brahma Sahampati.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having so said<br/> Brahmā Sahampati added this further:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Beholding this one way for ending birth,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> This way the All-compassionate doth know:<br/> By this way men ere now have crossed the flood,<br/> Shall cross and do cross now.</p>
