    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sumbhā, at Desakā, a district of the Sumbhā.</p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Once upon a time, monks, a bamboo acrobat<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> set up his pole and called to his pupil, Medakathālikā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, my lad,<br/> climb the pole and stand on my shoulder!'</p>

    <p class="f4">'All right, master,' replied the pupil to the bamboo acrobat,<br/> climbed the pole<br/> and stood on bis master's shoulder.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the master to bis pupil:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, Medakathālikā, my lad,<br/> you watch me and I'll watch you.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus watched and warded by each other,<br/> we'll show our tricks,<br/> get a good fee<br/> and come down safe<br/> from the bamboo pole.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">At these words Medakathālikā the pupil<br/> said to his master:</p>

    <p class="f4">'No, no!</p>

    <p class="f4">That won't do, master!</p>

    <p class="f4">You look after yourself<br/> and I'll look after myself.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus watched and warded,<br/> each by himself,<br/> we'll show our tricks,<br/> get a good fee<br/> and come down safe<br/> from the bamboo pole.</p>

    <p class="f4">That's the way to do it!'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, monies, just as Medakathālikā the pupil<br/> said to his master:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I'll look after myself,'</p>

    <p class="f4">so ought ye to observe<br/> the station of mindfulness which means<br/> 'I'll ward myself';</p>

    <p class="f4">likewise that which means<br/> 'We'll ward another.'</p>

    <p class="f4">By warding oneself, monks,<br/> one wards another.</p>

    <p class="f4">By warding another<br/> one wards himself.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks,<br/> by warding oneself<br/> does one ward another?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is by following after,<br/> by cultivating,<br/> by making much of him.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks,<br/> by warding another<br/> does one ward himself?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is by forbearance,<br/> by harmlessness,<br/> by goodwill,<br/> by compassion towards him.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is how he wards himself.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, ye must observe the station of mindfulness which means</p>

    <p class="f4">'I'll ward myself.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Ye must observe that which means:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I'll ward another.'</p>

    <p class="f4">It is by warding self, monks,<br/> that one wards another.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is by warding another<br/> that one wards himself."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Text title is <i>Sedaka</i> or (?) <i>Ekantaka</i>. These titles are from the <i>Uddāna,</i> generally corrupt. As above at text 89, I read <i>Desakā</i> of <i>JA.</i> i, 393.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Caṇḍāla-vaṅsika,</i> not as <i>Pali Dict.</i> <i>(s.v. vaṅsika)</i> 'a <i>caṇḍāla</i> (of scavenger caste) by descent,' but 'bamboo acrobat' (<i>vaṅsa</i> is primarily 'bamboo'; secondarily 'family'). For castes see <i>Dialogue.</i> i, 95 <i>ff.</i> <i>Caṇḍāla</i> according to <i>Comy.</i> at <i>DA.</i> i, 84 (<i>Cf.</i> <i>Dialogue.</i> i, 9), is a game with an iron ball <i>(caṇḍa-gula-kīla).</i> The name means 'ball-and-bamboo-acrobat.' The man balances a bamboo on forehead, chin, shoulder, or breast (as may be often seen in Ceylon or India). The pupil climbs up and balances himself, standing, sitting, or lying, on the point of the pole. <i>Cf.</i> <i>JA.</i> iv, 390, <i>candaṇḍāla-vaṅsa-dhopana-sippa.</i> Text has a confusion of capital C here.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Lit. 'Frying-pan.' Text has altered here to the masculine form of vocative (Burmese <i>MSS.</i> have it right), but <i>Comy.</i> notes that the name is a feminine one.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> 'The end of the pole rests on the man's forehead or throat. He must watch the balance of the pole closely, and not attend to the pupil on the end of the pole, who must look after himself.' It is possible, also, that here, as sometimes happens, both are balanced on the end of the pole.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> His regular systematic life which leads to Arahantship attracts the attention of another, who follows his example and so 'goes to heaven.'</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> <i>Anuddayā = anuhampā.</i> <i>Comy.</i> <i>anuddayāya sapubba-bhāgāya muditāya.</i></p>
