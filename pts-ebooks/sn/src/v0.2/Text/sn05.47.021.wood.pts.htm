    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Bhadda<br/> were staying at Pāṭaliputra<br/> in Cock's Pleasaunce.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhadda,<br/> rising from his solitude at eventide,<br/> went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously and,<br/> after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Bhadda said this<br/> to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, friend Ānanda,<br/> as to these virtuous habits<br/> spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/> what is the use of them?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said! well said, friend Bhadda!</p>

    <p class="f4">Welcome is your penetration,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> welcome is your ready wit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Goodly is your questioning.</p>

    <p class="f4">You ask this, friend Bhadda,<br/> do you not?</p>

    <p class="f4">'As to these virtuous habits<br/> spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/> what is the use of them?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, friend Bhadda, the virtuous habits<br/> spoken of by the Exalted One<br/> are those which come<br/> by the cultivation of four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, friend, are the virtuous habits<br/> so spoken of by the Exalted One, -<br/> those which come<br/> by the cultivation of the four stations of mindfulness."</p>
