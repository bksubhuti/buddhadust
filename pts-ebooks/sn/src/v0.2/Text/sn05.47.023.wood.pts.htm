    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Bhadda<br/> were staying at Pāṭaliputra<br/> in Cock's Pleasaunce.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhadda,<br/> rising from his solitude at eventide,<br/> went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously and,<br/> after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Bhadda said this<br/> to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, friend Ānanda, what is the condition,<br/> what is the cause,<br/> why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br/> the good Norm decays?</p>

    <p class="f4">What again, friend Ānanda, is the condition,<br/> what the cause,<br/> why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br/> the good Norm does not decay?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, friend Bhadda!</p>

    <p class="f4">Welcome is your penetration.</p>

    <p class="f4">Welcome is your ready wit.</p>

    <p class="f4">You ask this, do you not?</p>

    <p class="f4">'Pray, friend Ānanda, what is the condition,<br/> what is the cause,<br/> why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br/> the good Norm decays?</p>

    <p class="f4">What again, friend Ānanda, is the condition,<br/> what the cause,<br/> why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br/> the good Norm does not decay?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do, friend."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, friend, it is owing to not cultivating,<br/> not making much of<br/> four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, friend, is the reason<br/> why the good Norm decays.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, it is owing to cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> four stations of mindfulness<br/> that the good Norm does not decay.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is owing to not cultivating,<br/> not making much of<br/> these four stations of mindfulness<br/> that is the reason<br/> why the good Norm decays.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, it is owing to cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> these four stations of mindfulness<br/> that the good Norm does not decay.</p>
