    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain brahmin came to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously and,<br/> after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What is the condition, master Gotama,<br/> what is the cause,<br/> why, after the final passing away of the Tathāgata,<br/> the good Norm does not last long;<br/> and again, master Gotama,<br/> what is the condition,<br/> what the cause,<br/> why, after the final passing away of the Tathāgata,<br/> the good Norm does last long?"</p>

    <p class="f4">It is owing to not cultivating, brahmin,<br/> owing to not making much of<br/> four stations of mindfulness,<br/> that the good Norm does not last long<br/> after the final passing away of the Tathāgata.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is owing to cultivating, brahmin,<br/> owing to making much of<br/> four stations of mindfulness,<br/> that the good Norm lasts long<br/> after the final passing away of the Tathāgata.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is owing to not cultivating, brahmin,<br/> owing to not making much of<br/> these four stations of mindfulness,<br/> that the good Norm does not last long<br/> after the final passing away of the Tathāgata.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is owing to cultivating, brahmin,<br/> owing to making much of<br/> these four stations of mindfulness,<br/> that the good Norm lasts long<br/> after the final passing away of the Tathāgata."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as if one should lift up the fallen,<br/> discover the hidden,<br/> point out the way to the bewildered,<br/> show a light in the gloom, saying:|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now they that have eyes to see||<br/> can see objects,' -|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">even so in divers ways<br/> has the Exalted One expounded the truth.</p>

    <p class="f4">I, even I, lord,<br/> do go for refuge to the Exalted One,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order of monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me as his follower,<br/> as one who has taken refuge in him,<br/> from this day forth<br/> so long as my life shall last."</p>
