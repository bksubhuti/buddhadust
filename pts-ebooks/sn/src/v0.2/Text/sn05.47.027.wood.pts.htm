    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion<br/> the venerable Sāriputta<br/> and the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> and the venerable Anuruddha<br/> were staying at Sāketa in Cactus Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> together with Moggallāna the Great,<br/> rising from their solitude at eventide,<br/> went to visit the venerable Anuruddha,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously,<br/> and, after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Sāriputta said this<br/> to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'An adept!</p>

    <p class="f4">An adept!'</p>

    <p class="f4">is the saying, friend Anuruddha.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, friend Anuruddha,<br/> how far is this term applicable?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"By the perfect cultivation, friend,<br/> of four stations of mindfulness<br/> one is called 'an adept.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is by the perfect cultivation<br/> of these four stations of mindfulness, friend,<br/> that one is an adept."</p>
