    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion<br/> the venerable Sāriputta<br/> and the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/> and the venerable Anuruddha<br/> were staying at Sāketa in Cactus Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> together with Moggallāna the Great,<br/> rising from their solitude at eventide,<br/> went to visit the venerable Anuruddha,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously,<br/> and, after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Sāriputta said this<br/> to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

    <p class="f4">"By cultivating and making much<br/> of how many conditions<br/> has the venerable Anuruddha<br/> come to great super-knowledge?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, it is by cultivating and making much<br/> of four stations of mindfulness<br/> that I have come to great super-knowledge.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, friend, it is by cultivating,<br/> by making much<br/> of these four stations of mindfulness<br/> that I have come to understand the universe<br/> with its thousand worlds."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
