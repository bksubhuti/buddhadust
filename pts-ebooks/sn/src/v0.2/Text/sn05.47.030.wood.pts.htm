    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying near Rājagaha,<br/> in Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding Ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the house-father Mānadiṇṇa was sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the house-father Mānadiṇṇa called to a certain man, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come hither, good man!</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you go to the venerable Ānanda,<br/> and on coming to him,<br/> in my name bowing down at his feet,<br/> say this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Master, the house-father Mānadiṇṇa is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">He bows down at the feet of the venerable Ānanda,<br/> and says:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for me, master,<br/> if the venerable Ānanda would come<br/> to the dwelling of the house-father Mānadiṇṇa,<br/> out of compassion for him."'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very well, sir," said that man,<br/> in reply to the house-father Mānadiṇṇa,<br/> and went to where the venerable Ānanda was staying.</p>

    <p class="f4">On coming there,<br/> he saluted the venerable Ānanda<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As be thus sat<br/> that man said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master, the house-father Mānadiṇṇa is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">He bows down at the feet of the venerable Ānanda<br/> and begs that he will visit his dwelling,<br/> out of compassion for him."</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda assented by silence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br/> robing himself<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe,<br/> set off for the dwelling of the house-father Mānadiṇṇa,<br/> and on coming there<br/> sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having sat down,<br/> he said this to the house-father Mānadiṇṇa:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, house-father!</p>

    <p class="f4">I hope you are bearing up.</p>

    <p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br/> and not increase?</p>

    <p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating<br/> and not increasing?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, sir, I am not bearing up.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating,<br/> but of their increasing."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, house-father,<br/> thus must you train yourself:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will abide in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will abide in feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will abide in mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will abide in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That, house-father, is how you must train yourself."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Master, even when I am afflicted<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> by such painful feeling as this,<br/> I do abide in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I do abide in feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I do abide in mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I do abide in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, as to those five fetters of the lower sort<br/> shown by the Exalted One,<br/> I do not see a single one of them in myself<br/> that is not abandoned."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Good for you, house-father!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well gotten by you, house-father!</p>

    <p class="f4">You have declared the fruits of not returning, house-father!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>
