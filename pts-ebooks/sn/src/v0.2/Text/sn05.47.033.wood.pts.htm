    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"By whomsoever, monks, the four stations of mindfulness are neglected,<br/> by them also is neglected<br/> the Ariyan way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">By whomsoever, monks, the four stations of mindfulness are undertaken,<br/> by them also is undertaken<br/> the Ariyan way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">"These four stations of mindfulness, monks,<br/> if cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to downright revulsion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> to calm,<br/> to full comprehension,<br/> to perfect wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">"By whomsoever, monks, the four stations of mindfulness are neglected,<br/> by them also is neglected<br/> the Ariyan way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">By whomsoever, monks, the four stations of mindfulness are undertaken,<br/> by them also is undertaken<br/> the Ariyan way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>
