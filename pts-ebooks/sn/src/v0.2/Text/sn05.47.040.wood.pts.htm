    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">I will teach you, monks,<br/> a station of mindfulness,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/> the cultivation of<br/> a station of mindfulness,<br/> and the practice leading to the cultivation of<br/> a station of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is a station of mindfulness?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/> 'a station of mindfulness.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the cultivation of a station of mindfulness?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells contemplating the rise of things<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> in body.</p>

    <p class="f4">He so dwells contemplating the fall of things<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in body.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells contemplating both the rise and the fall of things in body,<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> having restrained the dejection in the world<br/> arising from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the practice leading to<br/> the cultivation of a station of mindfulness?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just this Ariyan eightfold way,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward's translation of <i>'-paṭṭhāna'</i> as 'stations' breaks down here where the use is put into the singular. Woodward inserts 'The Four' here, but below uses 'a station' which is very awkward when it deals with the four together. I have changed it here to the singular for internal consistency and consistency with the Pali. Bhk. Bodhi translates 'establishment'. Since <i>'-paṭṭhāna'</i> can also be understood in the sense of 'pasture' (resort or establishment as in residence, or alternatively as basis of nourishment) which would face the same issues, if 'station' or 'pasture' or 'resort' or the like is for some reason preferred, the solution would be to set up the sutta so that the whole sequence was repeated four times, once for each of the 'stations'.</p>
