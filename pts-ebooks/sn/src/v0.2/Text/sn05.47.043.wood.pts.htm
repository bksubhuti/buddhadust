    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"On a certain occasion, monks,<br/> I was staying at Uruvela,<br/> on the bank of the river Nerañjarā,<br/> under the Goatherds' Banyan,<br/> after I had just attained enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span> Then, monks, as I meditated in solitude,<br/> this train of thought arose in my mind:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the one sole way<br/> that leads to the purification of beings,<br/> to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br/> to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br/> to the winning of the Method,<br/> to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/> to wit:<br/> the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">A monk should dwell in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the one sole way<br/> that leads to the purification of beings,<br/> to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br/> to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br/> to the winning of the Method,<br/> to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/> to wit:<br/> the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br/> reading with his mind my mind,<br/> just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br/> or draw in his outstretched arm, -<br/> even so did Brahmā Sahampati vanish from the Brahma World<br/> and appear before me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br/> drawing his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/> joined his hands<br/> and raised them to me<br/> and thus spoke:</p>

    <p class="f4">'True it is, O Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">True it is, O Happy One!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the one sole way<br/> that leads to the purification of beings,<br/> to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br/> to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br/> to the winning of the Method,<br/> to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/> to wit:<br/> the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">A monk should dwell in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the one sole way<br/> that leads to the purification of beings,<br/> to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br/> to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br/> to the winning of the Method,<br/> to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/> to wit:<br/> the four stations of mindfulness.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati.</p>

    <p class="f4">So saying he added this further:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">'Beholding this one way for ending birth,<br/> This way the All-compassionate doth know:<br/> By this way men ere now have crossed the flood,<br/> Shall cross and do cross now.'"</p>
