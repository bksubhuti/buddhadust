    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a certain monk came to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One should teach me a teaching in brief,<br/> hearing which teaching from the Exalted One<br/> I might dwell solitary,<br/> remote,<br/> earnest,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well then, monk, you ought to purify the rudiments in good states.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monk, you must purify the rudiments in good states.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what are the rudiments in good states?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monk, abandoning wrong conduct in body,<br/> do you cultivate right conduct in body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise, abandoning wrong conduct in speech,<br/> you should cultivate right conduct in speech.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning wrong conduct in mind,<br/> you should cultivate right conduct in mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, monk, abandoning wrong conduct in body,<br/> cultivating right conduct in body<br/> abandoning wrong conduct in speech,<br/> cultivating right conduct in speech<br/> abandoning wrong conduct in mind,<br/> cultivating right conduct in mind,<br/> leaning on virtue,<br/> established in virtue,<br/> you should cultivate four stations of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monk, when you,<br/> leaning on virtue<br/> and established in virtue,<br/> shall have thus cultivated the four stations of mindfulness, -<br/> then, monk, you may look for that increase in good states<br/> which shall come to you,<br/> whether by night or by day,<br/> and not for decrease in good states."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then that monk was delighted with the words of the Exalted One<br/> and not long after,<br/> dwelling solitary,<br/> secluded,<br/> zealous,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> in no long time<br/> attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br/> to win which<br/> the clansmen rightly go forth from home<br/> to the homeless.</p>

    <p class="f4">So that in that very life,<br/> of himself,<br/> he fully understood it,<br/> realized it<br/> and abode therein,<br/> and knew:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the righteous life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> for life in these conditions<br/> there is no hereafter.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And that monk was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
