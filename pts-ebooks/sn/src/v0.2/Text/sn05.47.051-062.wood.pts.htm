    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, monks, whatsoever great rivers there be,<br/> such as the Ganges,<br/> <i>Yamunā,<br/> Acīravatī,<br/> Sarabhū<br/> and Mahī,</i><br/> all of them flow,<br/> slide<br/> and tend to the East,<br/> even so a monk who cultivates<br/> and makes much of<br/> the four stations of mindfulness<br/> flows,<br/> slides,<br/> tends to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks, by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> the four stations of mindfulness<br/> does a monk flow,<br/> slide<br/> and tend to Nibbāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus cultivating,<br/> thus making much of<br/> the four stations of mindfulness<br/> a monk flows,<br/> slides<br/> and tends to Nibbāna.</p>
