    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br/> the controlling power of energy,<br/> the controlling power of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling power of concentration,<br/> the controlling power of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not,<br/> as they really are<br/> the arising,<br/> the perishing of,<br/> the escape from<br/> these five controlling powers,<br/> such are not worthy to be accounted recluses among recluses,<br/> nor among brahmins as brahmins;<br/> nor have those worthies of themselves understood,<br/> or even in this life realized,<br/> the goal of recluseship<br/> or of brahminhood,<br/> nor do they dwell in the attainment of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, those recluses or brahmins who have under- <span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span> stood<br/> as they really are<br/> the arising,<br/> the perishing of,<br/> the escape from<br/> these five controlling powers,<br/> such are worthy to be accounted among recluses as recluses,<br/> and among brahmins as brahmins:<br/> and those worthies have of themselves understood<br/> and even in this life have realized<br/> the goal of recluseship<br/> and brahminhood,<br/> and they do dwell in the attainment thereof."</p>
