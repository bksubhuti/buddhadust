    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br/> the controlling power of energy,<br/> the controlling power of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling power of concentration,<br/> the controlling power of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the controlling power of faith?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has faith.</p>

    <p class="f4">He has faith in the wisdom of the Tathāgata, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> supremely Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/> 'the controlling power of faith.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the controlling power of energy?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br/> dwells resolute in energy,<br/> ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br/> to acquire good qualities,<br/> strenuously exerting himself,<br/> not throwing off the burden in good qualities.</p>

    <p class="f4">He starts desire,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> strives,<br/> sets going energy,<br/> lays hold of thought<br/> and exerts effort<br/> to prevent the arising of bad qualities not yet arisen.</p>

    <p class="f4">He starts desire<br/> strives,<br/> sets going energy,<br/> lays hold of thought<br/> and exerts effort<br/> to abandon bad qualities <span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span> that have arisen.</p>

    <p class="f4">He starts desire<br/> strives,<br/> sets going energy,<br/> lays hold of thought<br/> and exerts effort<br/> for the persistence of good qualities that have arisen,<br/> for their non-confusion,<br/> for their more-becoming,<br/> for their increase and development,<br/> for their perfecting.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/> 'the controlling power of energy.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the controlling power of mindfulness?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br/> is mindful,<br/> possessed of supreme discrimination,<br/> one who calls to mind and remembers<br/> things said and done long ago.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells in body contemplating body (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells in mind contemplating mind (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> composed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/> 'the controlling power of mindfulness.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the controlling power of concentration?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple,<br/> making self-surrender the object of his thought,<br/> lays hold of concentration,<br/> lays hold of one-pointedness.</p>

    <p class="f4">He, aloof from sensuality,<br/> aloof from evil conditions,<br/> enters on the first trance,<br/> which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/> which is born of solitude,<br/> easeful and zestful,<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br/> he enters on<br/> (that inward calm,<br/> that single-minded purpose,<br/> apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of mental balance,<br/> zestful<br/> and full of ease,<br/> which is)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> the second trance,<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then (by the fading out of zest<br/> he becomes balanced<br/> and remains mindful and composed,<br/> and experiences with the body<br/> that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:<br/> The balanced thoughtful man<br/> dwells happily; and)<br/> he enters on the third trance<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain,<br/> by the coming to an end<br/> of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br/> he enters on<br/> and abides in<br/> the fourth trance,<br/> which is free of pain<br/> and free of pleasure,<br/> a state of perfect purity of balance and equanimity.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is called<br/> 'the controlling power of concentration.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span> And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the controlling power of insight?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br/> is possessed of insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">He has insight<br/> for tracing out the rise and fall of things,<br/> insight which is Ariyan,<br/> penetrating,<br/> going on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands, as it really is,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Such is ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands, as it really is,</p>

    <p class="f4">'Such is the arising of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands, as it really is,</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice<br/> that goes to the cessation of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/> 'the controlling power of insight.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, monks, are the five controlling powers."</p>
