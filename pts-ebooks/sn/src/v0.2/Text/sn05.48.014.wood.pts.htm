    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br/> the controlling power of energy,<br/> the controlling power of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling power of concentration,<br/> the controlling power of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">By the completion and fulfilment, monks,<br/> of these five controlling powers<br/> one is Arahant.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> one is a non-returner.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having them in a still less degree,<br/> one is a once-returner.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree than that,<br/> one is a stream-winner.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a still less degree,<br/> one is a Norm-follower.</p>

    <p class="f4">If one have these five controlling powers<br/> in a still less degree than that, he is<br/> 'one who walks by faith.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is, monks, that he who completes his task<br/> succeeds completely,<br/> while he who does part only<br/> succeeds partially.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, these five controlling powers<br/> are not barren of results,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> I declare.</p>
