    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br/> the controlling power of energy,<br/> the controlling power of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling power of concentration,<br/> the controlling power of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">By the completion and fulfilment, monks,<br/> of these five controlling powers<br/> one is Arahant.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> one obtains release midway.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he attains release by a reduction of his time.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he attains release without much trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he attains release with some trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he is 'one who goes up stream,'<br/> one who goes to the Pure Abodes.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he is a once-returner.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he is a stream-winner.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he is a Norm-follower.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he is 'one who walks by faith.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is, monks, that he who completes his task<br/> succeeds completely,<br/> while he who does part only<br/> succeeds partially.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span> Thus, monks, these five controlling powers<br/> are not barren of results,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> I declare.</p>
