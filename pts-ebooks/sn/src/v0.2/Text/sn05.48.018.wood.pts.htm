    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br/> the controlling power of energy,<br/> the controlling power of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling power of concentration,<br/> the controlling power of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">By the completion and fulfilment, monks,<br/> of these five controlling powers<br/> one is Arahant.</p>

    <p class="f4">If one have them in a less degree,<br/> he is practising to realize the fruits of Arahantship.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree<br/> one is a non-returner.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he is a once-returner.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he is a stream-winner.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he is a Norm-follower.</p>

    <p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/> he is 'one who walks by faith.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, he in whom these five controlling powers<br/> are in every way,<br/> everywhere,<br/> wholly and utterly absent,<br/> of such an one I say<br/> 'he is an outsider,<br/> one who stands in the ranks of the many-folk.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
