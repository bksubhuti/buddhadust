    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a certain monk came to visit the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Perfect in faculties!</p>

    <p class="f4">Perfect in faculties!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is the saying, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far is one perfect in faculties?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, monk, a monk cultivates the controlling power of faith,<br/> which leads to tranquillity,<br/> which leads to the perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the controlling power of energy,<br/> which leads to tranquillity,<br/> which leads to the perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the controlling power of mindfulness,<br/> which leads to tranquillity,<br/> which leads to the perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the controlling power of concentration,<br/> which leads to tranquillity,<br/> which leads to the perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the controlling power of insight,<br/> which leads to tranquillity,<br/> which leads to the perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far a monk is possessed of perfection in faculties.'</p>
