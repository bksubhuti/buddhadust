    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br/> the controlling power of energy,<br/> the controlling power of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling power of concentration,<br/> the controlling power of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the five controlling powers.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, so long as I did not fully comprehend,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising<br/> and the perishing of,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> and the escape from<br/> these five controlling powers,<br/> just so long, monks, did I not know the meaning of<br/> 'being enlightened<br/> with supreme enlightenment<br/> with regard to the world<br/> and its devas,<br/> its Maras,<br/> its Brahmas,<br/> with regard to the host<br/> of recluses and brahmins,<br/> of devas and mankind.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, when I came to know fully,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising<br/> and the perishing of,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> and the escape from<br/> these five controlling powers,<br/> then, monks, I fully knew the meaning of<br/> 'being enlightened<br/> with supreme enlightenment<br/> with regard to the world<br/> and its devas,<br/> its Maras,<br/> its Brahmas,<br/> with regard to the host<br/> of recluses and brahmins,<br/> of devas and mankind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then arose in me knowledge and insight thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sure is my heart's release.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is my last birth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now is there no more becoming.'"</p>
