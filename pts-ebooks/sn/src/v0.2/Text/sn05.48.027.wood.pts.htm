    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six sense-faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">The sense-faculty of eye,<br/> the sense-faculty of ear,<br/> the sense-faculty of nose,<br/> the sense-faculty of tongue,<br/> the sense-faculty of body<br/> the sense-faculty of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the six sense faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">When a monk,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> by seeing,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising<br/> and the perishing of,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of<br/> and the escape from<br/> these six sense-faculties,<br/> becomes released without grasping, -<br/> such a monk is called 'Arahant,<br/> in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br/> one who has lived the life,<br/> done the task,<br/> lifted the burden,<br/> a winner of his own welfare,<br/> one who has outworn the fetters of rebirth,<br/> one released by perfect insight.'"</p>
