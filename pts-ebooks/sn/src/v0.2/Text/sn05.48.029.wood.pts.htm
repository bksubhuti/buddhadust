    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six sense-faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">The sense-faculty of eye,<br/> the sense-faculty of ear,<br/> the sense-faculty of nose,<br/> the sense-faculty of tongue,<br/> the sense-faculty of body<br/> the sense-faculty of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the six sense faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising<br/> and the perishing of,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> and the escape from<br/> these six faculties of sense,<br/> such are not worthy to be accounted<br/> as recluses among recluses<br/> nor as brahmins among brahmins,<br/> nor have those worthies of themselves understood,<br/> or even in this life realized,<br/> the goal of recluseship<br/> or of brahminhood,<br/> nor do they dwell in the attainment of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, those recluses and brahmins who do understand,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising<br/> and the perishing of,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of,<br/> and the escape from<br/> these six faculties of sense,<br/> such are worthy to be accounted<br/> as recluses among recluses<br/> and as brahmins among brahmins,<br/> and those worthies have of themselves understood,<br/> even in this life realized,<br/> the goal of recluseship<br/> and brahminhood,<br/> and they do dwell in the attainment of it."</p>
