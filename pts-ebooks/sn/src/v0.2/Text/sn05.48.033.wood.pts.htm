    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of ease,<br/> the controlling faculty of discomfort,<br/> the controlling faculty of happiness,<br/> the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br/> the controlling faculty of indifference.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the five controlling faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now when a monk, by understanding,<br/> as they really are,<br/> the arising<br/> and the perishing of,<br/> the satisfaction in,<br/> the misery of<br/> and the escape from<br/> these five controlling faculties,<br/> is freed without grasping,<br/> such an Ariyan disciple is called<br/> 'Arahant,<br/> one in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br/> one who has lived the life,<br/> done his task,<br/> lifted the burden,<br/> a winner of his own welfare,<br/> who has outworn the fetters of rebirth,<br/> one who is released by perfect insight.'</p>
