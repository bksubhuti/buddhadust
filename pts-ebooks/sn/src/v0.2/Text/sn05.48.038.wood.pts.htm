    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of ease,<br/> the controlling faculty of discomfort,<br/> the controlling faculty of happiness,<br/> the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br/> the controlling faculty of indifference.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the five controlling faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">"And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the controlling faculty of ease?</p>

    <p class="f4">That ease which is bodily,<br/> that agreeableness which is bodily,<br/> that ease,<br/> that agreeableness<br/> which is experienced<br/> when it arises from bodily contact, -<br/> that, monks, is called<br/> 'the controlling faculty of ease.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the controlling faculty of discomfort?</p>

    <p class="f4">That discomfort which is bodily,<br/> that disagreeableness which is bodily,<br/> that discomfort,<br/> that disagreeableness<br/> which is experienced<br/> when it arises from bodily contact, -<br/> that, monks, is called<br/> 'the controlling faculty of discomfort.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the controlling faculty of happiness?</p>

    <p class="f4">That happiness which is mental,<br/> that agreeableness which is mental,<br/> that happiness,<br/> that agreeableness<br/> which is experienced<br/> when it arises from mental contact, -<br/> that, monks, is called<br/> 'the controlling faculty of happiness.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the controlling faculty of unhappiness?</p>

    <p class="f4">That pain which is mental,<br/> that disagreeableness which is mental,<br/> that pain,<br/> that disagreeableness<br/> which is experienced<br/> when it arises from mental contact, -<br/> that, monks, is called<br/> 'the controlling faculty of unhappiness.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the controlling faculty of indifference?</p>

    <p class="f4">That bodily or mental feeling experienced,<br/> which is neither agreeable nor disagreeable, -<br/> that, monks, is called<br/> 'the controlling faculty of indifference.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, in these cases,<br/> the controlling faculty of ease<br/> and the controlling faculty of happiness<br/> should be regarded as pleasurable feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise the controlling faculty of discomfort<br/> and that of unhappiness<br/> must be regarded as painful feeling.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise the controlling faculty of indifference<br/> must be regarded as feeling that is neither pleasant nor painful.</p>

    <p class="f4">These indeed, monks, are the five controlling faculties."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is, monks, that these five controlling faculties,<br/> from being five, become three,<br/> and again, from being three,<br/> they become five in turn.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
