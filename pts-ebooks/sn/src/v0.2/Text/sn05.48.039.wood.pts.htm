    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of ease,<br/> the controlling faculty of discomfort,<br/> the controlling faculty of happiness,<br/> the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br/> the controlling faculty of indifference.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the five controlling faculties.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, owing to the contact<br/> that is to be experienced as agreeable, monks,<br/> arises the controlling faculty of ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">He (who experiences it),<br/> being at ease,<br/> is fully aware of being so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Also, on the ceasing of that contact<br/> to be experienced as agreeable,<br/> as to that controlling faculty of ease, -<br/> which had arisen owing to that appropriate<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> contact<br/> to be experienced as agreeable, -<br/> he is aware that it ceases,<br/> that it is quieted down.</p>
