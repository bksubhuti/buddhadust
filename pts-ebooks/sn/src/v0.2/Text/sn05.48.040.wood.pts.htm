    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of discomfort,<br/> the the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br/> controlling faculty of ease,<br/> the controlling faculty of happiness,<br/> the controlling faculty of indifference.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the five controlling faculties.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein, monks, suppose a monk dwells earnest,<br/> ardent,<br/> and aspiring,<br/> and there arises in him the controlling faculty <span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span> of discomfort.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is aware of it thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There has arisen in me<br/> this controlling faculty of discomfort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now this is conditioned,<br/> has its cause,<br/> its constituent parts,<br/> its reasons.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That the controlling faculty of discomfort<br/> should arise without these conditions,<br/> causes,<br/> constituent parts<br/> and reasons,<br/> is quite impossible.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he comes to know fully<br/> both the controlling faculty of discomfort,<br/> its arising<br/> and its ceasing:<br/> and, whence arising,<br/> how this controlling faculty of discomfort<br/> comes to cease without remainder,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> -<br/> that also he fully knows.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, whence does it arise<br/> and how does it come to cease without remainder?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk,<br/> aloof from sense-desires,<br/> aloof from evil conditions,<br/> enters upon the first trance,<br/> which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of seclusion,<br/> zestful<br/> and easeful,<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Here the controlling faculty of discomfort,<br/> which has arisen,<br/> ceases without remainder.</p>

    <p class="f4">This monk is called<br/> 'A monk who has understood the ceasing<br/> of the controlling faculty of discomfort,<br/> one who has collected his mind<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> for the attaining such a condition.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein again, monks,<br/> suppose a monk dwells earnest,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> and there arises in him<br/> the controlling faculty of unhappiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is aware of it thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There has arisen in me<br/> this controlling faculty of unhappiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now this is conditioned,<br/> has its cause,<br/> its constituent parts<br/> and reasons.</p>

    <p class="f4">That the controlling faculty of unhappiness<br/> should arise without these conditions,<br/> causes,<br/> constituent parts<br/> and reasons<br/> is quite impossible.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he comes to know fully<br/> both the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br/> and its arising<br/> and its ceasing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Also he fully knows,<br/> whence arising,<br/> how this controlling faculty of unhappiness<br/> comes to cease without remainder.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span> Now whence does it arise,<br/> and how does it come to cease without remainder?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk,<br/> by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/> attains and abides in the second trance,<br/> that inward calming,<br/> that single-mindedness of will,<br/> apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/> that is born of mental balance,<br/> zestful and easeful.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is here that the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br/> which has arisen,<br/> comes to cease without remainder.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such an one, monks, is called</p>

    <p class="f4">'A monk who has come to know<br/> the ceasing of the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br/> one who has collected his mind<br/> for attaining such a condition.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein again, monks,<br/> suppose a monk dwells earnest,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> and there arises in him<br/> the controlling faculty of ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is aware of it thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There has arisen in me<br/> this controlling faculty of ease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now this is conditioned,<br/> has its cause,<br/> its constituent parts<br/> and its reasons.</p>

    <p class="f4">That the controlling faculty of ease<br/> should arise without these conditions,<br/> causes,<br/> constituent parts<br/> and reasons,<br/> is quite impossible.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he comes to know<br/> both the controlling faculty of ease<br/> and its arising<br/> and its ceasing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Also he fully knows,<br/> whence arising,<br/> how this controlling faculty of ease<br/> comes to cease without remainder.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now whence does it arise<br/> and how does it come to cease without remainder?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk,<br/> by the fading out of zest,<br/> disinterested,<br/> mindful and composed,<br/> experiences with body<br/> that ease of which the Ariyans declare:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He who is disinterested and alert<br/> dwells at ease,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">and he so attains and abides<br/> in the third trance.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is here that the controlling faculty of ease,<br/> which has arisen,<br/> comes to cease <span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span> without remainder.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such an one, monks, is called<br/> 'A monk who has understood<br/> the ceasing of the controlling faculty of ease,<br/> one who has collected his mind<br/> for attaining such a condition.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein again, monks,<br/> suppose a monk dwells earnest,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring,<br/> and there arises in him<br/> the controlling faculty of happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is aware of it thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he comes to know<br/> the controlling faculty of happiness<br/> and its arising<br/> and its ceasing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Also he fully knows,<br/> whence arising,<br/> how this controlling faculty of happiness<br/> comes to cease without remainder.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now whence does it arise<br/> and how does it come to cease without remainder?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks,<br/> by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br/> by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br/> he attains and abides in the fourth trance,<br/> a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br/> an equanimity of utter purity.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein the controlling faculty of happiness,<br/> which had arisen,<br/> comes to cease without remainder.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such an one, monks, is called<br/> 'A monk who has understood the ceasing<br/> of the controlling faculty of happiness,<br/> one who has collected his mind<br/> for attaining such a condition.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein again, monks,<br/> suppose a monk dwells earnest,<br/> ardent<br/> and aspiring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then there arises in him<br/> the controlling faculty of indifference.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is aware of it thus:</p>
