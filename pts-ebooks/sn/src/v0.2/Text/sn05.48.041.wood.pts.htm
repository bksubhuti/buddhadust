    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> in East Park,<br/> at the terraced house of Migara's mother.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One,<br/> having arisen from his solitude at eventide,<br/> was seated warming his back<br/> in the westering sunshine.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable ṭnanda came to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and, while chafing his limbs<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> with his hand,<br/> said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is a strange thing, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is a wonder, lord,<br/> how the skin of the Exalted One<br/> is no longer clear and translucent,<br/> and how all his limbs are slack<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> and <span class="f2 g"><b>[192]</b></span> wrinkled,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> his body bent forward,<br/> and a change is to be seen<br/> in his sense-faculties of eye,<br/> ear,<br/> nose,<br/> tongue<br/> and body!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"So it is, Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">Old age is by nature inherent in youth,<br/> sickness in health,<br/> and death in life.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it is<br/> that my skin is no longer clear and translucent as of yore;<br/> my limbs are slack and wrinkled,<br/> my body stoops forward<br/> and a change is to be noticed<br/> in my sense-faculties of eye,<br/> ear,<br/> nose,<br/> tongue<br/> and body."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having so said, the Happy One as Teacher added this:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Shame on thee,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> miserable age!<br/> Age that makes colour fade!<br/> The pleasing image<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> of a man By age is trampled down.<br/> The' one should live a hundred years,<br/> Natheless he is consigned to death.<br/> Death passes nothing by,<br/> But tramples everything.</p>
