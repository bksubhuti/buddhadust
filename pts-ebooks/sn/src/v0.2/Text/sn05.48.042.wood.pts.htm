    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> in East Park,<br/> at the terraced house of Migara's mother.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the brahmin Uṇṇābha came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously,<br/> and, after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/> Uṇṇābha the brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are these five sense-faculties, master Gotama,<br/> of different scope,<br/> of different range.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not mutually <span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span> enjoy<br/> each other's scope and range.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The sense-faculty of eye,<br/> that of ear,<br/> that of nose,<br/> that of tongue,<br/> and the sense-faculty of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, master Gotama, as these five sense-faculties<br/> are of different scope,<br/> of different range,<br/> and do not mutually enjoy each other's scope and range,<br/> pray, what common ground of resort<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> have they,<br/> and who profits by their scope and range?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are, brahmin, as you say,<br/> these five sense-faculties<br/> of different scope<br/> and different range,<br/> and they do not mutually<br/> enjoy each other's scope and range.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The sense-faculty of eye,<br/> that of ear,<br/> that of nose,<br/> that of tongue,<br/> and the sense-faculty of body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well, mind is their common ground of resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is mind that profits by their scope and range."</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, master Gotama, what is the resort of mind?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Mindfulness, brahmin, is the resort of mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, master Gotama, what is the resort of mindfulness?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Release, brahmin, is the resort of mindfulness."</p>

    <p class="f4">"What, then, master Gotama, is the resort of release?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Nibbāna, brahmin, is the resort of release."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, master Gotama, what is the resort of Nibbāna?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"The question goes too far,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> brahmin.</p>

    <p class="f4">That question is beyond the compass of an answer.</p>

    <p class="f4">The aim of living the holy life, brahmin,<br/> is to plunge<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> into Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">It has Nibbāna for its goal,<br/> Nibbāna for its ending."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the brahmin Unriabha was delighted with the words of the Exalted One and received them gladly.</p>

    <p class="f4">And he rose up from his seat,<br/> saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/> and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of the brahmin Uṇṇābha<br/> the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, in a house with a peaked roof<br/> or in a pavilion with a peaked roof,<br/> with a window facing east,<br/> when the sun is rising<br/> and its rays strike through the window,<br/> on what do they rest?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"On the western wall, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just so, monks,<br/> the faith of the brahmin Uṇṇābha is bent on,<br/> rooted in,<br/> rests on the Tathāgata.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is strong,<br/> not to be uprooted<br/> by any recluse<br/> or brahmin<br/> or deva<br/> or Mara<br/> or Brahma,<br/> or by anyone else in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if at this time<br/> the brahmin Uṇṇābha were to make an end,<br/> there is no fetter, bound by which,<br/> the brahmin Uṇṇābha would come back to this world."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
