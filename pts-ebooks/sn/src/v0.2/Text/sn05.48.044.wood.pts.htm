    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/> in Eastern Gatehouse.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the venerable Sāriputta thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Do you believe, Sāriputta, that the controlling faculty of faith,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has the Deathless for its goal,<br/> the Deathless for its ending?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span> Do you believe, Sāriputta, that the controlling faculty of energy,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has the Deathless for its goal,<br/> the Deathless for its ending?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you believe, Sāriputta, that the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has the Deathless for its goal,<br/> the Deathless for its ending?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you believe, Sāriputta, that the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has the Deathless for its goal,<br/> the Deathless for its ending?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you believe, Sāriputta, that the controlling faculty of insight,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has the Deathless for its goal,<br/> the Deathless for its ending?"</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">In this matter, lord,<br/> I walk not by faith<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> in the Exalted One,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">That the controlling faculty of faith,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has the Deathless for its goal,<br/> the Deathless for its ending;</p>

    <p class="f4">that the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has the Deathless for its goal,<br/> the Deathless for its ending;</p>

    <p class="f4">that the controlling faculty of insight,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has the Deathless for its goal,<br/> the Deathless for its ending.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">But, lord, they who have realized,<br/> seen,<br/> understood,<br/> made sure of,<br/> they who have attained this fact by insight, -<br/> such are free from doubt,<br/> free from wavering,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> (in believing)<br/> that the controlling faculty of faith,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has the Deathless for its goal,<br/> the Deathless for its ending;</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed they who have not realized,<br/> not seen,<br/> not understood,<br/> who have not made sure of,<br/> who have not attained this fact by insight, -<br/> such may well walk by faith in others<br/> (in believing)<br/> that the controlling <span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span> faculty of faith,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has the Deathless for its goal,<br/> the Deathless for its ending;</p>
