    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> in East Park,<br/> at the terraced house of Migara's mother.</p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, by cultivating and making much<br/> of what controlling faculties<br/> does the monk in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br/> declare gnosis,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know full well<br/> that destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> there is no more of being here for me'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br/> things have the Exalted one as their root,<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">It were well for us<br/> if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br/> of what he has just uttered."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, monks, by cultivating and making much<br/> of five controlling faculties,<br/> a man in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br/> may thus declare gnosis:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know full well<br/> that destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> there is no more of being here for me.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">And what are those five controlling faculties?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith<br/> the controlling faculty of energy,<br/> the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is by cultivating and making much of these five controlling faculties,<br/> a man in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br/> may thus declare gnosis:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know full well<br/> that destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> there is no more of being here for me.'"</p>
