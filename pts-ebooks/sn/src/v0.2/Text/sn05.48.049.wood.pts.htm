    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī<br/> in Ghosita Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Bhāradvājan,<br/> the venerable Scrap-hunter,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> so called,<br/> had declared gnosis,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I know full well<br/> that destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> there is no more of being here for me."</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of monks<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> came to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated,<br/> those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, the Bhāradvājan,<br/> the venerable Scrap-hunter,<br/> had declared gnosis,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know full well<br/> that destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, in consequence of what observation<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> did the Bhāradvājan,<br/> the venerable Scrap-hunter,<br/> thus declare gnosis,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know full well<br/> that destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> there is no more of being here for me.'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, it was in consequence of having cultivated<br/> and made much of<br/> three controlling faculties<br/> that the Bhārad- <span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span> vājan,<br/> the venerable Scrap-hunter,<br/> thus declared gnosis,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know full well<br/> that destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">What three?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> the controlling faculty of insight.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">It was in consequence of having cultivated<br/> and made much of<br/> these three controlling faculties<br/> that gnosis was declared by the Bhāradvājan, the venerable Scrap-hunter,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know full well<br/> that destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now these three controlling faculties, -<br/> what do they end in?</p>

    <p class="f4">They end in destruction.</p>

    <p class="f4">They end in destruction of what?</p>

    <p class="f4">They end in the destruction of rebirth,<br/> old age<br/> and death.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, it was because he saw full well<br/> that rebirth was destroyed,<br/> that old age was destroyed,<br/> that death was destroyed,<br/> that the Bhāradvājan, the venerable Scrap-hunter,<br/> was able to declare gnosis,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I know full well<br/> that destroyed is rebirth,<br/> lived is the holy life,<br/> done is the task,<br/> there is no more of being here for me.'"</p>
