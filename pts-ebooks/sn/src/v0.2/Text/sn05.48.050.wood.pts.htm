    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Angas, at Market<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> so called,<br/> a township of the Angas.</p>

    <p class="f4">2. Now on that occasion the Exalted One addressed the venerable Sāriputta, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Tell me, Sāriputta, could an Ariyan disciple who is utterly devoted to,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> who has perfect faith in the Tathāgata, -<br/> could an Ariyan disciple have any doubt or wavering<br/> as to the Tathāgata<br/> or the Tathāgata's teaching?</p>

    <p class="f4">3. 'Lord, an Ariyan disciple who is utterly devoted to the <span class="f2 g"><b>[201]</b></span> Tathāgata,<br/> who has perfect faith in the Tathāgata,<br/> could have no doubt,<br/> could have no wavering<br/> as to the Tathāgata<br/> or the Tathāgata's teaching.</p>

    <p class="f4">4. Of the Ariyan disciple who has faith, lord, this may be expected:</p>

    <p class="f4">He will dwell resolute in energy,<br/> ever striving to abandon bad qualities<br/> and to acquire good qualities:</p>

    <p class="f4">He will be stout and strong to exert himself,<br/> not throwing off the burden in good qualities.</p>

    <p class="f4">His energy, lord, is the controlling faculty of energy.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">5. Of a faithful Ariyan disciple, lord,<br/> who is resolute in energy,<br/> this may be expected:</p>

    <p class="f4">He will be mindful,<br/> possessed of supreme discrimination,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> one who calls to mind and remembers<br/> things said long ago.</p>

    <p class="f4">His mindfulness, lord, is the controlling faculty of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">6. Of a faithful Ariyan disciple, lord,<br/> who is resolute in energy,<br/> with mindfulness established,<br/> this may be expected:</p>

    <p class="f4">He will make self-surrender the object of his thought,<br/> he will lay hold of concentration,<br/> one-pointedness of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">His concentration, lord, is the controlling faculty of concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">7. Again, lord, of a faithful Ariyan disciple who is established in mindfulness,<br/> whose thought is tranquillized,<br/> this may be expected:</p>

    <p class="f4">He will fully understand:</p>

    <p class="f4">"A world without end<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> is the round of rebirth.</p>

    <p class="f4">No beginning can be seen of beings<br/> hindered by ignorance,<br/> bound by craving,<br/> who run on,<br/> who fare on<br/> through the round of rebirth.</p>

    <p class="f4">The utter passionless ceasing of ignorance,<br/> of this body of darkness,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> is this blissful state,<br/> this excellent<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> state,<br/> to wit: -<br/> the calming down of all the activities,<br/> the giving up of all bases (for rebirth),<br/> the destruction of craving,<br/> dispassion,<br/> cessation,<br/> Nibbāna."</p>

    <p class="f4">His insight, lord, is the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">8. Lord, that faithful Ariyan disciple,<br/> thus striving and striving <span class="f2 g"><b>[202]</b></span> again,<br/> thus recollecting again and again,<br/> thus again and again composing bis mind,<br/> thus clearly discerning again and again,<br/> gains utter confidence,<br/> when he considers:</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to those things<br/> which formerly I had only heard tell of,<br/> now I dwell having experienced them<br/> in my own person:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/> now by insight<br/> have I pierced them through<br/> and see them plain."</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, lord, his faith is the controlling faculty of faith.'</p>

    <p class="f4">9. Well said! Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, Sāriputta,<br/> the Ariyan disciple who is utterly devoted to the Tathāgata,<br/> who has perfect faith in the Tathāgata,<br/> can have no doubt or wavering in the Tathāgata<br/> or the Tathāgata's teaching.</p>

    <p class="f4">10. Indeed, Sāriputta,<br/> of the faithful Ariyan disciple this may be expected:</p>

    <p class="f4">He will dwell resolute in energy,<br/> ever striving to abandon bad qualities<br/> and to acquire good qualities:</p>

    <p class="f4">He will be stout and strong to exert himself,<br/> not throwing off the burden in good qualities.</p>

    <p class="f4">His energy, Sāriputta, is the controlling faculty of energy.</p>

    <p class="f4">11. Of a faithful Ariyan disciple, Sāriputta,<br/> who is resolute in energy,<br/> this may be expected:</p>

    <p class="f4">He will be mindful,<br/> possessed of supreme discrimination,<br/> one who calls to mind and remembers<br/> things said long ago.</p>

    <p class="f4">His mindfulness, Sāriputta, is the controlling faculty of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">12. Of a faithful Ariyan disciple, Sāriputta,<br/> who is resolute in energy,<br/> with mindfulness established,<br/> this may be expected:</p>

    <p class="f4">He will make self-surrender the object of his thought,<br/> he will lay hold of concentration,<br/> one-pointedness of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">His concentration, Sāriputta, is the controlling faculty of concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">11. Again, Sāriputta, of a faithful Ariyan disciple who is established in mindfulness,<br/> whose thought is tranquillized,<br/> this may be expected:</p>

    <p class="f4">He will fully understand:</p>

    <p class="f4">"A world without end<br/> is the round of rebirth.</p>

    <p class="f4">No beginning can be seen of beings<br/> hindered by ignorance,<br/> bound by craving,<br/> who run on,<br/> who fare on<br/> through the round of rebirth.</p>

    <p class="f4">The utter passionless ceasing of ignorance,<br/> of this body of darkness,<br/> is this blissful state,<br/> this excellent state,<br/> to wit: -<br/> the calming down of all the activities,<br/> the giving up of all bases (for rebirth),<br/> the destruction of craving,<br/> dispassion,<br/> cessation,<br/> Nibbāna."</p>

    <p class="f4">His insight, Sāriputta, is the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">13. Sāriputta, that faithful Ariyan disciple,<br/> thus striving and striving again,<br/> thus recollecting again and again,<br/> thus again and again composing bis mind,<br/> thus clearly discerning again and again,<br/> gains utter confidence,<br/> when he considers:</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to those things<br/> which formerly I had only heard tell of,<br/> now I dwell having experienced them<br/> in my own person:<br/> now by insight<br/> have I pierced them through<br/> and see them plain."</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Sāriputta, his faith is the controlling faculty of faith.'</p>
