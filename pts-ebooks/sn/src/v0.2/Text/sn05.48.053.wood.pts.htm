    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī<br/> in Ghosita Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Tell me, monks,<br/> is there any method<br/> by proceeding according to which<br/> a monk who is a learner,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> standing at the level of a learner,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> can be assured:|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am a learner,'|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">or a monk who is an adept,<br/> standing at the level of an adept,<br/> can be assured:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am an adept'?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br/> things have the Exalted one as their root,<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">It were well for us<br/> if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br/> of what he has just uttered.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/> the brethren will remember it."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, monks, there is such a method<br/> by proceeding according to which<br/> a monk who is a learner,<br/> standing at the level of a learner,<br/> can be assured:|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am a learner,'|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">and a monk who is an adept,<br/> standing at the level of an adept,<br/> can be assured:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am an adept.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort is that method, monks?</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk who is a learner<br/> knows full well</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is <span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span> Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He knows full well</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He knows full well</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He knows full well</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice leading to the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, monks, is the method<br/> by proceeding according to which<br/> a monk who is a learner,<br/> standing at the level of a learner,<br/> can be assured:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, a monk who is a learner<br/> thus ponders:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Is there, I wonder,<br/> outside<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> (this Order of monks)<br/> anyone,<br/> whether recluse or brahmin,<br/> who can teach a doctrine<br/> that is natural,<br/> true<br/> and proper,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> such as the Exalted One teaches?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he concludes:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There is no one<br/> outside (this Order of monks)<br/> whether recluse or brahmin,<br/> who can teach a doctrine<br/> that is natural,<br/> true<br/> and proper,<br/> such as the Exalted One teaches.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the method<br/> by proceeding according to which<br/> a monk who is a learner,<br/> standing at the level of a learner,<br/> can be assured:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br/> the monk who is a learner<br/> is fully aware of the five controlling faculties:</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br/> the controlling faculty of energy,<br/> the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">But as to what is their destiny,<br/> what their excellence,<br/> what their fruits<br/> and final goal,<br/> he dwells not in personal experience<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> thereof,<br/> nor does he pierce through and through by insight<br/> and see them plain.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the method<br/> by proceeding according to which<br/> a monk who is a learner,<br/> standing at the level of a learner,<br/> can be assured:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the method<br/> according to which the adept monk<br/> standing at the level of an adept<br/> can be assured:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am an adept'?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein the adept monk<br/> fully understands the five controlling faculties:</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br/> the controlling faculty of energy,<br/> the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Likewise as to what is their destiny,<br/> what their excellence,<br/> their fruits<br/> and final goal,<br/> he dwells in personal experience thereof:<br/> he pierces them through and through and sees them plain.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is the method by which an adept monk<br/> standing at the level of an adept<br/> can be assured:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am an adept.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span> Then again, a monk who is an adept<br/> fully understands the six sense-faculties,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">The sense-faculty of eye,<br/> the sense-faculty of ear,<br/> the sense-faculty of nose,<br/> the sense-faculty of tongue,<br/> the sense-faculty of body<br/> the sense-faculty of mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">He understands:</p>

    <p class="f4">'These six sense-faculties<br/> must come to cease without remainder,<br/> utterly,<br/> altogether,<br/> in every way<br/> and everywhere:<br/> nor shall other six sense-faculties arise<br/> anywhere<br/> or anyhow.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He knows that full well.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, monks is the method by which an adept monk<br/> standing at the level of an adept<br/> can be assured:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I am an adept.'</p>
