    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī<br/> in Ghosita Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just as, monks, of all scented heart-woods whatsoever<br/> the red sandalwood is reckoned chief,<br/> even so, monks,<br/> of all the principles whatsoever<br/> that are on the side of the wisdom,<br/> the <span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span> controlling faculty of insight is reckoned chief,<br/> that is, for attaining the wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> are the principles<br/> that are on the side of the wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith, monks,<br/> is a principle that is on the side of the wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">It conduces to attaining the wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of mindfulness, monks,<br/> is a principle that is on the side of the wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">It conduces to attaining the wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> is a principle that is on the side of the wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">It conduces to attaining the wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of insight,<br/> is a principle that is on the side of the wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">It conduces to attaining the wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just as, monks, of all scented heart-woods whatsoever<br/> the red sandalwood is reckoned chief,<br/> even so, monks,<br/> of all the principles whatsoever<br/> that are on the side of the wisdom,<br/> the controlling faculty of insight is reckoned chief,<br/> that is, for attaining the wisdom.</p>
