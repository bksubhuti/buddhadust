    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, by a monk<br/> who is established in one condition<br/> the five controlling faculties are cultivated<br/> and cultivated well.</p>

    <p class="f4">Established in what condition?</p>

    <p class="f4">In earnestness.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is earnestness?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk wards his mind amid the <i>āsavas</i><br/> and conditions that go with the <i>āsavas</i><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">As he so wards his mind,<br/> by cultivating the controlling faculty of faith,<br/> he goes to perfection therein;<br/> by cultivating the controlling faculty of energy,<br/> he goes to perfection therein;<br/> by cultivating the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/> he goes to perfection therein;<br/> by cultivating the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> he goes to perfection therein;<br/> by cultivating the controlling faculty of insight,<br/> he goes to perfection therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is how in a monk<br/> who is established in one condition<br/> the five controlling faculties are cultivated<br/> and cultivated well.</p>
