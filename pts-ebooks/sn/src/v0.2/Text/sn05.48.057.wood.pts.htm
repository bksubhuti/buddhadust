    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard: On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Uruvelā,<br/> on the bank of the river Nerañjarā,<br/> under the Goatherds' Banyan,<br/> just after his attainment of perfect enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span> Now in the Exalted One, when he had retired to his solitary communing,<br/> there arose this mental reflection:</p>

    <p class="f4">"There are five controlling faculties which,<br/> cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunge into the Deathless,<br/> have their end and goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has its end in the Deathless,<br/> has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of energy<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has its end in the Deathless,<br/> has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of mindfulness<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has its end in the Deathless,<br/> has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of concentration<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has its end in the Deathless,<br/> has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of insight<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has its end in the Deathless,<br/> has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">These five,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunge into the Deathless,<br/> have their end and goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati,<br/> reading with his mind<br/> the mental reflection of the Exalted One, -<br/> just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm<br/> or bend his outstretched arm, -<br/> even so did Brahmā Sahampati vanish from the Brahma World<br/> and appear before the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then did Brahmā Sahampati,<br/> throwing his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/> stretch out his folded palms towards the Exalted One<br/> and thus address him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Even so, Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, O Happy One!</p>

    <p class="f4">These five controlling faculties,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunge into the Deathless,<br/> have their end in the Deathless,<br/> have their goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has its end in the Deathless,<br/> has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of energy<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has its end in the Deathless,<br/> has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of mindfulness<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has its end in the Deathless,<br/> has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of concentration<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has its end in the Deathless,<br/> has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of insight<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunges into the Deathless,<br/> has its end in the Deathless,<br/> has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">These five,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> plunge into the Deathless,<br/> have their end and goal in the Deathless.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once upon a time, sir,<br/> when Kassapa was the supremely Enlightened One,<br/> I was practising the holy life.</p>

    <p class="f4">Men knew me then as Sahaka the monk.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then it was, sir, that by cultivating and making much of<br/> these five controlling faculties,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> and by restraining<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> sensual lust in things of sense,<br/> on the breaking up of body,<br/> I was reborn in the Happy World after death,<br/> in the Brahma-World.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereafter men knew me as Brahma Sahampati,<br/> Brahma Sahampati!</p>

    <p class="f4">So it is, Exalted One!</p>

    <p class="f4">So it is, O Happy One!</p>

    <p class="f4">I know it!</p>

    <p class="f4">I see it, - that these five controlling faculties,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> do plunge into the Deathless,<br/> do end and have their goal in the Deathless."</p>
