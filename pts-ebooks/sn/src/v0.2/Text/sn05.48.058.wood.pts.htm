    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha<br/> on Vulture's Peak Hill,<br/> in the Boar's Cave.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One addressed the venerable Sāriputta saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Tell me, Sāriputta.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seeing what reason therefore<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> does a monk in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br/> practise and observe<br/> supreme reverence<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> for the Tathāgata<br/> or the teachings of the Tathāgata?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, it is because he sees therein<br/> utter security from the yoke<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> that he practises and observes<br/> supreme reverence for the Tathāgata or the Tathāgata's teachings."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is indeed<br/> because he sees therein<br/> utter security from the yoke<br/> that he practises and observes<br/> supreme reverence for the Tathāgata or the Tathāgata's teachings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">But of what sort<br/> is that utter security from the yoke<br/> which he sees therein<br/> utter security from the yoke<br/> that he practises and observes<br/> supreme reverence for the Tathāgata or the Tathāgata's teachings?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, lord, the monk in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span> cultivates the controlling faculty of faith,<br/> which goes on to the perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the controlling faculty of energy,<br/> which goes on to the perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/> which goes on to the perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the controlling faculty of insight,<br/> which goes on to the perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, lord, is the utter security from the yoke,<br/> seeing which he practises and observes<br/> supreme reverence for the Tathāgata or the Tathāgata's teachings."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

    <p class="f4">That is indeed the utter security from the yoke<br/> which he sees therein<br/> utter security from the yoke<br/> that he practises and observes<br/> supreme reverence for the Tathāgata or the Tathāgata's teachings.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">But of what sort, Sāriputta,<br/> is the supreme reverence<br/> which such a monk practises and observes<br/> towards the Tathāgata<br/> or the Tathāgata's teachings?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, lord, the monk in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br/> dwells reverential and respectful to the Teacher.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells reverential and respectful to the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells reverential and respectful to the Saṅgha.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells reverential and respectful to the concentration.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This, lord, is the supreme reverence<br/> which the monk in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br/> practises and observes<br/> towards the Tathāgata<br/> or the teachings of the Tathāgata."</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Sūkara-khatā</i> (<i>lit.</i> 'boar-dug'). <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i, 497 (where Long Nails, the hermit, converses with the Master); <i>UdA.</i> 189 (referring to that event) calls it <i>Sūkara-Leṇa.</i> <i>Comy.</i> thus describes it: They say that in Kassapa Buddha's time this cave was found as a hollow in the ground when the earth was yet growing, during the interval between the two Buddhas (<i>Buddhantara,</i> like <i>Manuvantara,</i> the period between two Manus), One day a boar rooted up <i>(khaṇi)</i> the soil in the neighbourhood of the ground concealing the cave. The sky-god rained and washed the soil away, and the mouth of the cave was disclosed. A forest-dweller, on seeing it, exclaimed: 'This must be a resort used by a holy man of olden times. I'll look after it' So he removed the earth all round, cleaned it out, fenced it in, made it as spick and span as a golden bowl polished with sand, and so turned the cave into a hermit's cell furnished with couch and stool and all, and presented it to the Exalted One for a dwelling-place. The cave was deep, and one had to climb to get there.<br/> At <i>K.S.</i> ii, 169 <i>ff.,</i> Mahā Moggallāna has clairvoyant sight of things that happened in this neighbourhood in the time of the Buddha Kassapa.</p>
