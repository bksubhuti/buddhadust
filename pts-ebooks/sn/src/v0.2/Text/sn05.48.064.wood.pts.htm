    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties which,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> conduce to the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br/> the controlling faculty of energy,<br/> the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These indeed are the five controlling faculties which,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> conduce to the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>."</p>
