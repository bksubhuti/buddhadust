    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br/> the controlling faculty of energy,<br/> the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the five controlling faculties.</p>

    <p class="f4">By the act of cultivating and making much<br/> of these five controlling faculties,<br/> seven fruits,<br/> seven advantages<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> are to be looked for.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the seven?</p>

    <p class="f4"><b>1.</b> In this very life,<br/> beforehand,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> one establishes realization.</p>

    <p class="f4"><b>2.</b> If not in this very life,<br/> beforehand,<br/> at any rate one does so at the moment of death.</p>

    <p class="f4"><b>3.</b> If not in this very life,<br/> beforehand,<br/> or at the moment of death,<br/> at any rate, by wearing down the five fetters<br/> that bind to the lower world,<br/> he is one who wins release midway.</p>

    <p class="f4"><b>4.</b> If not in this very life,<br/> beforehand,<br/> or at the moment of death,<br/> or by wearing down the five fetters<br/> that bind to the lower world,<br/> winning release midway,<br/> yet by reduction of his time<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> one wins release.</p>

    <p class="f4"><b>5.</b> If not in this very life,<br/> beforehand,<br/> or at the moment of death,<br/> or by wearing down the five fetters<br/> that bind to the lower world,<br/> winning release midway,<br/> or by reduction of his time<br/> winning release,<br/> he wins release without much trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4"><b>6.</b> If not in this very life,<br/> beforehand,<br/> or at the moment of death,<br/> or by wearing down the five fetters<br/> that bind to the lower world,<br/> winning release midway,<br/> or by reduction of his time<br/> winning release,<br/> or by winning release without much trouble<br/> he wins release with some trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4"><b>7.</b> If not in this very life,<br/> beforehand,<br/> or at the moment of death,<br/> or by wearing down the five fetters<br/> that bind to the lower world,<br/> winning release midway,<br/> or by reduction of his time<br/> winning release,<br/> or by winning release without much trouble<br/> or by winning release with some trouble<br/> still by having worn down the five fetters<br/> that bind to the lower world,<br/> he is 'one who goes up stream'<br/> and he goes to the Pure Abodes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, it is by the act of cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> these five controlling faculties<br/> that these seven fruits,<br/> these seven advantages<br/> are to be looked for.</p>
