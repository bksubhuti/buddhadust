    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just as, monks, of all trees whatsoever<br/> of the Asuras,<br/> the pied trumpet-flower tree is reckoned chief,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> even so, of all conditions whatsoever<br/> which are on the side of the wisdom,<br/> the controlling faculty of insight is reckoned chief,<br/> that is, for attaining the wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> are the conditions that are on the side of the wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">They are the controlling faculty of faith,<br/> the controlling faculty of energy,<br/> the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/> the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/> the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just as, monks, of all trees whatsoever<br/> of the Asuras,<br/> the pied trumpet-flower tree is reckoned chief,<br/> even so, of all conditions whatsoever<br/> which are on the side of the wisdom,<br/> the controlling faculty of insight is reckoned chief,<br/> that is, for attaining the wisdom.</p>
