    <p class="f4">Herein a monk starts desire<br/> for the non-arising of ill,<br/> unprofitable states<br/> not yet arisen:<br/> he makes an effort,<br/> sets going energy,<br/> he lays hold of<br/> and exerts his mind<br/> (to this end).</p>

    <p class="f4">He starts desire<br/> for the abandoning of ill,<br/> unprofitable states<br/> that have arisen:<br/> he makes an effort,<br/> sets going energy,<br/> he lays hold of<br/> and exerts his mind<br/> (to this end).</p>

    <p class="f4">He starts desire<br/> for the arising<br/> of profitable states<br/> not yet arisen:<br/> he makes an effort,<br/> sets going energy,<br/> he lays hold of<br/> and exerts his mind<br/> (to this end).</p>

    <p class="f4">He starts desire<br/> for the establishing<br/> of profitable states<br/> that have arisen,<br/> for their non-confusion,<br/> for their more-becoming,<br/> for their increase,<br/> cultivation<br/> and fulfilment:<br/> he makes an effort,<br/> sets going energy,<br/> he lays hold of<br/> and exerts his mind<br/> (to this end).</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, a monk who is earnest<br/> cultivates<br/> and makes much of<br/> the four right efforts.</p>
