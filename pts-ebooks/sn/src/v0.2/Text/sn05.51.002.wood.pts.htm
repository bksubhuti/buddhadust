    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">By whomsoever, monks, the four bases of psychic power are neglected, by them also is neglected the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">By whomsoever, monks, the four bases of psychic power are undertaken, by them also is undertaken the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> desire,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> energy,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> thought,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> investigation,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, by whomsoever these four bases of psychic power are neglected, by them also is neglected the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">By whomsoever, monks, the four bases of psychic power are undertaken, by them also is undertaken the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>
