    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these four bases of psychic power,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> go hence as the Ariyan hence-goers.</p>

    <p class="f4">For him that acts in accordance therewith<br/> they conduce to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> desire,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> energy,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> thought,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> investigation,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, these four bases of psychic power,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> go hence as the Ariyan hence-goers.</p>

    <p class="f4">For him that acts in accordance therewith<br/> they conduce to the utter destruction of ill.</p>
