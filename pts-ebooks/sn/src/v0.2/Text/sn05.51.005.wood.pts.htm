    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whosoever in time past,<br/> whether recluses or brahmins,<br/> have successfully practised<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> psychic power<br/> in a partial degree,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> all such have done so<br/> by cultivating and making much of<br/> the four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever in future time,<br/> whether recluses or brahmins,<br/> shall successfully practise psychic power<br/> in a partial degree,<br/> all such shall do so<br/> by cultivating and making much of<br/> the four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever in the present time,<br/> whether recluses or brahmins,<br/> do successfully practise psychic power<br/> in a partial degree,<br/> all such do so<br/> by cultivating and making much of<br/> the four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> desire,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> energy,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> thought,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> investigation,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whosoever in time past,<br/> whether recluses or brahmins,<br/> have successfully practised psychic power<br/> in a partial degree,<br/> all such have done so<br/> by cultivating and making much of<br/> the four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever in future time,<br/> whether recluses or brahmins,<br/> shall successfully practise psychic power<br/> in a partial degree,<br/> all such shall do so<br/> by cultivating and making much of<br/> the four bases of psychic power.</p>
