    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever monks in time past have,<br/> by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/> by their own personal knowledge<br/> realized in this very life,<br/> attained and dwelt in the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight<br/> that is freed from the āsavas,-<br/> all of them have done so<br/> by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/> the four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever monks shall in future time,<br/> by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/> by their own personal knowledge<br/> realize in this very life,<br/> attain and dwell in the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight<br/> that is freed from the āsavas,-<br/> all of them will do so<br/> by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/> the four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever monks at the present time do,<br/> by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/> by their own personal knowledge<br/> realize in this very life,<br/> attain and dwell in the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight<br/> that is freed from the āsavas,-<br/> all of them do so<br/> by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/> the four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> desire,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> energy,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> thought,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> investigation,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever monks in time past have,<br/> by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/> by their own personal knowledge<br/> realized in this very life,<br/> attained and dwelt in the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight<br/> that is freed from the āsavas,-<br/> all of them have done so<br/> by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/> the four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever monks shall in future time,<br/> by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/> by their own personal knowledge<br/> realize in this very life,<br/> attain and dwell in the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight<br/> that is freed from the āsavas,-<br/> all of them will do so<br/> by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/> the four bases of psychic power.</p>
