    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, there are these four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> desire,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> energy,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> thought,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> investigation,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">These indeed, monks, are the four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/> these four bases of psychic power, monks,<br/> that the Tathāgata is called Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
