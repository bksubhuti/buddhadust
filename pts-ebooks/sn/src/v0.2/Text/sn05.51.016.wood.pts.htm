    <p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> in time past<br/> were of mighty psychic power and majesty,<br/> all of them were so<br/> by the fact of cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> in future time<br/> shall be of mighty psychic power and majesty,<br/> all of them will be so<br/> by the fact of cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> four bases of psychic power.</p>
