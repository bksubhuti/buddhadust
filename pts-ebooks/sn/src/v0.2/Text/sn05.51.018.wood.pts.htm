    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, it is by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> four bases of psychic power<br/> that a monk,<br/> by the destruction of the <i>āsavas,</i><br/> realizes even in this very life<br/> by his own unaided powers<br/> the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight<br/> which is free from the <i>āsavas,</i><br/> and having won it<br/> dwells therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> desire,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> energy,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> thought,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> investigation,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, it is by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> these four bases of psychic power<br/> that a monk,<br/> by the destruction of the <i>āsavas,</i><br/> realizes even in this very life<br/> by his own unaided powers<br/> the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight<br/> which is free from the <i>āsavas,</i><br/> and having won it<br/> dwells therein.</p>
