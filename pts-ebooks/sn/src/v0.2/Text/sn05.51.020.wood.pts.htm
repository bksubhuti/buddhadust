    <p class="f4">When a monk has thus cultivated,<br/> thus made much of,<br/> the four bases of psychic power,<br/> he calls to mind his former births in divers ways thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">One birth,<br/> two births,<br/> three births,<br/> four births,<br/> five births,<br/> even ten births,<br/> twenty births,<br/> thirty births,<br/> forty births,<br/> fifty births;<br/> even a hundred births,<br/> a thousand births,<br/> a hundred thousand births.</p>

    <p class="f4">He calls to mind divers aeons of involution<br/> divers aeons of evolution,<br/> diverse aeons of involution and evolution.</p>

    <p class="f4">He knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Such was I by name,<br/> such was I by clan,<br/> by caste.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus was I nourished,<br/> thus did I undergo pleasure and pain,<br/> such was my span of life.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Thence I deceased<br/> and rose up so and so.</p>

    <p class="f4">There I dwelt,<br/> of such and such a name,<br/> of such a clan,<br/> of such a caste,<br/> so nourished;<br/> such and such pleasure and pain did I undergo,<br/> such my span of life.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thence deceased<br/> I rose up in the present life.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how<br/> in fact and detail<br/> he calls to mind in divers ways<br/> his former births.</p>

    <p class="f4">When a monk has thus cultivated,<br/> thus made much of,<br/> the four bases of psychic power,<br/> with the deva-sight,<br/> purified and surpassing that of man,<br/> he beholds beings:<br/> as they decease and rise up (elsewhere)<br/> he knows them,<br/> both mean and exalted,<br/> of features fair and foul,<br/> gone to weal<br/> or gone to woe,<br/> according to their deeds, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Alas! these good folk,<br/> given to the practice of evil deeds,<br/> of evil words,<br/> of evil thoughts,<br/> scoffing at the noble ones,<br/> of perverted views<br/> and reaping the fruit of their perverted views, -<br/> these folk,<br/> on the dissolution of body,<br/> after death arose again in the Waste,<br/> the Downfall<br/> and the Constant Round.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ah! and these good folk,<br/> given to the practice of good deeds,<br/> of good words,<br/> of good thoughts,<br/> not scoffing at the noble ones,<br/> of sound views<br/> and reaping the fruits of their sound views, -<br/> these beings,<br/> on the dissolution of body,<br/> after death arose again in the Happy Way,<br/> the Heaven World.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus with deva-sight,<br/> purified and surpassing that of man,<br/> does he behold beings<br/> as they decease and rise up (elsewhere):<br/> he knows them,<br/> both mean and exalted,<br/> of features fair and foul,<br/> gone to weal<br/> or gone to woe<br/> according to their deeds.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks, it is by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> these four bases of psychic power<br/> that a monk,<br/> by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/> in this very life,<br/> by his own unaided powers<br/> attains the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight,<br/> that is free from the āsavas,<br/> realizes it<br/> and dwells therein."</p>
