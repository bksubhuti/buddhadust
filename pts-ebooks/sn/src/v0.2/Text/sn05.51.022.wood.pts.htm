    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to visit the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus seated<br/> the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, does the Exalted One understand<br/> how to reach,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> by psychic power<br/> the Brahma World<br/> in his mind-made body?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"I do understand<br/> how to reach,<br/> by psychic power<br/> the Brahma World<br/> in my mind-made body, Ānanda."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, lord, does the Exalted One understand how<br/> by psychic power<br/> to reach the Brahma World<br/> in this (physical) body<br/> of the four great elements?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"I do understand how<br/> by psychic power<br/> to reach the Brahma World<br/> in this (physical) body<br/> of the four great elements Ānanda."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That the Exalted One, lord, should know<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> how to reach by psychic power<br/> the Brahma World<br/> both in his mind-made body<br/> and in this (physical) body<br/> of the four great elements<br/> is a wonder and a marvel."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, Ānanda.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Tathāgatas are possessed of powers that are wonderful and marvellous.</p>

    <p class="f4">At such time, Ānanda,<br/> as the Tathāgata concentrates body in mind<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> and concentrates mind in body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> at such time as he <span class="f2 g"><b>[258]</b></span> enters on<br/> and abides in<br/> the consciousness of bliss and buoyancy,<br/> then it is, Ānanda, that the Tathāgata's body<br/> is more buoyant,<br/> softer,<br/> more plastic<br/> and more radiant.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, Ānanda, an iron ball,<br/> if heated all day long,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> is lighter<br/> and softer,<br/> more plastic<br/> and more radiant,<br/> even so at such time as the Tathāgata concentrates body in mind<br/> and concentrates mind in body, -<br/> at such time as the Tathāgata enters on<br/> and abides in<br/> the consciousness of bliss and buoyancy,<br/> then it is, Ānanda,<br/> that the Tathāgata's body<br/> is more buoyant,<br/> softer,<br/> more plastic<br/> and more radiant.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, whenever the Tathāgata concentrates body in mind<br/> and mind in body,<br/> and enters on<br/> and abides in<br/> the consciousness of bliss and buoyancy, -<br/> at such time, Ānanda,<br/> the Tathāgata's body<br/> with but little effort<br/> rises up from the ground<br/> into the air.</p>

    <p class="f4">He then enjoys<br/> in divers ways<br/> manifold forms of magic power,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/> from being many he becomes one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Manifest or invisible<br/> he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/> through a rampart,<br/> through a mountain,<br/> as if it were through air.</p>

    <p class="f4">He plunges into the earth<br/> and shoots up again<br/> as if in water.</p>

    <p class="f4">He walks upon the water<br/> without parting it,<br/> as if on solid ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">He travels sitting cross-legged through the air,<br/> like a bird upon the wing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even this moon and sun,<br/> though they be of such mighty power and majesty,<br/> he handles and strokes them with his hand.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as far as the Brahma World<br/> he has power with his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, Ānanda, a tuft of cotton seed<br/> or a ball of thistledown,<br/> lightly wafted on the wind,<br/> with but little effort<br/> rises up from the ground<br/> into the air,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> even so at such time as the Tathāgata concentrates body in mind<br/> and mind in body<br/> and enters on<br/> and abides in<br/> the consciousness of bliss and buoyancy, -<br/> at such time, Ānanda,<br/> the Tathāgata's body<br/> with but little effort<br/> rises up from the ground<br/> into the air.</p>

    <p class="f4">He then enjoys<br/> in divers ways<br/> manifold forms of magic power,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/> from being many he becomes one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Manifest or invisible<br/> he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/> through a rampart,<br/> through a mountain,<br/> as if it were through air.</p>

    <p class="f4">He plunges into the earth<br/> and shoots up again<br/> as if in water.</p>

    <p class="f4">He walks upon the water<br/> without parting it,<br/> as if on solid ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">He travels sitting cross-legged through the air,<br/> like a bird upon the wing.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Text should read <i>upasañkamituṅ</i> in this and next paragraph and below.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>V.M.</i> 405.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> There is a difficulty of reading here. Text has <i>yañ ca kho opapāti ha</i> (?) (Sinh. <i>v.l.</i> <i>opāti;</i> Burm. <i>omāti</i>), for which <i>Pali Dict.</i> suggests <i>opapātiyā (iddhiyā).</i> But there is no verb in the sentence, and I would read <i>pahoti (potest).</i> <i>Comy.</i> also seems at a loss. My two <i>Sinh.</i> <i>MSS.</i> of it have <i>nāpi opātihamā ti, pahoti, taṅ sakkoti.</i> 'This,' says <i>Comy.</i> 'is the pure text of the Buddha's word in Tipitaka.' I cannot refer to printed <i>S.</i> ed. of it here.</p>
