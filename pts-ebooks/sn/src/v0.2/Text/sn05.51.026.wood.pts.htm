    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> desire,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> energy,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> thought,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> investigation,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four bases of psychic power.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> these four bases of psychic power<br/> that seven fruits,<br/> seven profits may be looked for.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this very life, previously,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> he establishes realization:<br/> and if he do not so beforehand,<br/> in this very life,<br/> at any rate he establishes realization at the time of his death.</p>

    <p class="f4">And if in this very life, beforehand,<br/> he do not establish realization,<br/> nor do so at the time of death,<br/> then, through having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> he wins release midway.</p>

    <p class="f4">But if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br/> in this very life,<br/> nor yet at the time of death,<br/> and if he, by wearing down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> win not release midway, -<br/> then at any rate,<br/> after having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> he wins release by reduction of his (allotted) time.</p>

    <p class="f4">But if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br/> in this very life,<br/> nor yet at the time of death,<br/> and if he, by wearing down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> win not release midway, -<br/> nor wins release by reduction of his (allotted) time,<br/> at any rate, by having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> he wins release without much trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br/> in this very life,<br/> nor yet at the time of death,<br/> and if he, by wearing down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> win not release midway, -<br/> nor wins release by reduction of his (allotted) time,<br/> nor wins release without much trouble,<br/> at any rate, by having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> then he wins release with some trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br/> in this very life,<br/> nor yet at the time of death,<br/> and if he, by wearing down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> win not release midway, -<br/> nor wins release by reduction of his (allotted) time,<br/> nor wins release without much trouble,<br/> nor wins release with some trouble,<br/> at any rate, by having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> then he is 'one who goes upstream,'<br/> and he goes to the Pure Abodes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, it is by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> these four bases of psychic power<br/> that seven fruits,<br/> seven profits may be looked for.</p>
