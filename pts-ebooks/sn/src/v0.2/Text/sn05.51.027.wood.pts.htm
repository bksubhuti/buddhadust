    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to visit the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, what is psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the basis of psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the cultivation and practice<br/> that leads to the cultivation of psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, a monk enjoys<br/> in divers ways<br/> manifold forms of psychic power such as:</p>

    <p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/> from being many he becomes one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Manifest or invisible<br/> he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/> through a rampart,<br/> through a mountain,<br/> as if it were through air.</p>

    <p class="f4">He plunges into the earth<br/> and shoots up again<br/> as if in water.</p>

    <p class="f4">He walks upon the water<br/> without parting it,<br/> as if on solid ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">He travels sitting cross-legged through the air,<br/> like a bird upon the wing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even this moon and sun,<br/> though they be of such mighty power and majesty,<br/> he handles and strokes them with his hand.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as far as the Brahma World<br/> he has power with his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is called<br/> 'psychic power.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, Ānanda, is the basis of psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">That path, that practice which conduces to the laying hold of,<br/> to the winning of<br/> psychic power, -<br/> that, monks, is called<br/> 'the basis of psychic power.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, Ānanda,<br/> is the cultivation of psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein Ānanda a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> desire,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> energy,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> thought,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> investigation,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is called<br/> 'the cultivation of the bases of psychic power.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, Ānanda,<br/> is the practice<br/> that leads to the cultivation of psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just this Ariyan eightfold way, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is called: 'the practice<br/> that leads to the cultivation<br/> of the bases of psychic power'."</p>
