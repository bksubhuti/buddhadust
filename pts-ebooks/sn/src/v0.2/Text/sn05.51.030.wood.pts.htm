    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of monks came to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As they sat at one side<br/> those the Exalted One said this to those monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"What, monks, is psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the basis of psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the practice<br/> that leads to the cultivation of psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br/> things have the Exalted one as their root,<br/> their guide,<br/> their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">It were well for us<br/> if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br/> of what he has just uttered.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/> the brethren will remember it."</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk enjoys<br/> in divers ways<br/> manifold forms of psychic power such as:</p>

    <p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/> from being many he becomes one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Manifest or invisible<br/> he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/> through a rampart,<br/> through a mountain,<br/> as if it were through air.</p>

    <p class="f4">He plunges into the earth<br/> and shoots up again<br/> as if in water.</p>

    <p class="f4">He walks upon the water<br/> without parting it,<br/> as if on solid ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">He travels sitting cross-legged through the air,<br/> like a bird upon the wing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even this moon and sun,<br/> though they be of such mighty power and majesty,<br/> he handles and strokes them with his hand.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as far as the Brahma World<br/> he has power with his body.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/> 'psychic power.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the basis of psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">That path, that practice which conduces to the laying hold of,<br/> to the winning of<br/> psychic power, -<br/> that, monks, is called<br/> 'the basis of psychic power.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the cultivation of psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein monks a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> desire,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> energy,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> thought,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are<br/> investigation,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration<br/> and struggle.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/> 'the cultivation of the bases of psychic power.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/> is the practice<br/> that leads to the cultivation of psychic power?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is just this Ariyan eightfold way, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called: 'the practice<br/> that leads to the cultivation<br/> of the bases of psychic power'."</p>
