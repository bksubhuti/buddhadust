    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of monks came to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As they sat at one side<br/> those the Exalted One said this to those monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, what think ye?</p>

    <p class="f4">By cultivating<br/> and making much<br/> of what conditions<br/> is the monk Moggallāna<br/> of such mighty magic power and majesty?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have their root in the Exalted One<br/> they have the Exalted One for their guide and their resort.</p>

    <p class="f4">Well indeed if the meaning of these words<br/> should show itself in the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Hearing the meaning of them from the Exalted One<br/> the monks will bear it in mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then do ye listen, monks.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is through cultivating<br/> and making much<br/> of four bases of psychic power<br/> that the monk Moggallāna<br/> is of such mighty magic power<br/> and majesty.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein (monks) the monk Moggallāna cultivates the basis of psychic power<br/> of which the features are desire,<br/> together with the co-factors<br/> of concentration and struggle,<br/> (with this intent):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus shall not my desire<br/> be over-sluggish<br/> nor overstrained.</p>

    <p class="f4">It shall not be inwardly cramped<br/> nor outwardly diffuse."</p>

    <p class="f4">So he abides fully conscious<br/> of what is behind and what is in front.</p>

    <p class="f4">As (he is conscious of what is) in front, so behind:<br/> as behind, so in front:<br/> as below, so above:<br/> as above, so below:<br/> as by day, so by night:<br/> as by night, so by day.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus with wits alert,<br/> with wits unhampered,<br/> he cultivates his mind to brilliancy.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[257]</b></span> Again monks, it is by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> these four bases of psychic power<br/> that the monk Moggallāna enjoys manifold forms of psychic power, thus: -</p>

    <p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/> from being many he becomes one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Manifest or invisible<br/> he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/> through a rampart,<br/> through a mountain,<br/> as if it were through air.</p>

    <p class="f4">He plunges into the earth<br/> and shoots up again<br/> as if in water.</p>

    <p class="f4">He walks upon the water<br/> without parting it,<br/> as if on solid ground.</p>

    <p class="f4">He travels sitting cross-legged through the air,<br/> like a bird upon the wing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even this moon and sun,<br/> though they be of such mighty power and majesty,<br/> he handles and strokes them with his hand.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even as far as the Brahma World<br/> he has power with his body.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When the monk Moggallāna has thus cultivated,<br/> thus made much of,<br/> the four bases of psychic power,<br/> with deva-power of hearing,<br/> purified and surpassing that of man,<br/> he hears sounds<br/> both of devas and of humans,<br/> whether far or near.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When the monk Moggallāna has thus cultivated,<br/> thus made much of,<br/> the four bases of psychic power,<br/> he knows the minds of other beings,<br/> of other persons,<br/> with his own mind grasping them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is lustful<br/> he knows it to lustful.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is free from lust<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is free from lust.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is full of hate<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is full of hate.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is free from hate<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is free from hate.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is deluded<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is deluded.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is free from delusion<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is free.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is cramped<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is cramped.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is diffuse<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is diffuse.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is lofty<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is lofty,</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is mean<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is mean.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind which is inferior<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is inferior.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is superior<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is superior.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is uncontrolled<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is uncontrolled.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is controlled<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is controlled.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is in bondage<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is in bondage:</p>

    <p class="f4">Of the mind that is released<br/> he knows it to be a mind that is released.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When the monk Moggallāna has thus cultivated,<br/> thus made much of,<br/> the four bases of psychic power,<br/> he calls to mind his former births in divers ways thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">One birth,<br/> two births,<br/> three births,<br/> four births,<br/> five births,<br/> even ten births,<br/> twenty births,<br/> thirty births,<br/> forty births,<br/> fifty births;<br/> even a hundred births,<br/> a thousand births,<br/> a hundred thousand births.</p>

    <p class="f4">He calls to mind divers aeons of involution<br/> divers aeons of evolution,<br/> diverse aeons of involution and evolution.</p>

    <p class="f4">He knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Such was I by name,<br/> such was I by clan,<br/> by caste.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus was I nourished,<br/> thus did I undergo pleasure and pain,<br/> such was my span of life."</p>

    <p class="f4">He knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thence I deceased<br/> and rose up so and so.</p>

    <p class="f4">There I dwelt,<br/> of such and such a name,<br/> of such a clan,<br/> of such a caste,<br/> so nourished;<br/> such and such pleasure and pain did I undergo,<br/> such my span of life.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thence deceased<br/> I rose up in the present life."</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how<br/> in fact and detail<br/> he calls to mind in divers ways<br/> his former births.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">When the monk Moggallāna has thus cultivated,<br/> thus made much of,<br/> the four bases of psychic power,<br/> with the deva-sight,<br/> purified and surpassing that of man,<br/> he beholds beings:<br/> as they decease and rise up (elsewhere)<br/> he knows them,<br/> both mean and exalted,<br/> of features fair and foul,<br/> gone to weal<br/> or gone to woe,<br/> according to their deeds, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Alas! these good folk,<br/> given to the practice of evil deeds,<br/> of evil words,<br/> of evil thoughts,<br/> scoffing at the noble ones,<br/> of perverted views<br/> and reaping the fruit of their perverted views, -<br/> these folk,<br/> on the dissolution of body,<br/> after death arose again in the Waste,<br/> the Downfall<br/> and the Constant Round.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ah! and these good folk,<br/> given to the practice of good deeds,<br/> of good words,<br/> of good thoughts,<br/> not scoffing at the noble ones,<br/> of sound views<br/> and reaping the fruits of their sound views, -<br/> these beings,<br/> on the dissolution of body,<br/> after death arose again in the Happy Way,<br/> the Heaven World."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus with deva-sight,<br/> purified and surpassing that of man,<br/> does he behold beings<br/> as they decease and rise up (elsewhere):<br/> he knows them,<br/> both mean and exalted,<br/> of features fair and foul,<br/> gone to weal<br/> or gone to woe<br/> according to their deeds.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks, it is by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> these four bases of psychic power<br/> that the monk Moggallāna,<br/> by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/> in this very life,<br/> by his own unaided powers<br/> he attains the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight,<br/> that is free from the āsavas,<br/> realizes it<br/> and dwells therein.'"</p>
