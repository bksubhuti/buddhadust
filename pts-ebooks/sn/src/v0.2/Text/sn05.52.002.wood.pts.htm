    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now when the venerable Anuruddha was meditating in solitude<br/> this train of thought occurred to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Whosoever neglect the four arisings of mindfulness,<br/> by them also is neglected<br/> the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whosoever undertake the four arisings of mindfulness,<br/> by them also is undertaken<br/> the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/> reading with his mind<br/> the train of thought<br/> in the mind of the venerable Anuruddha, -<br/> just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br/> or draw in his outstretched arm, -<br/> even so did he appear before the venerable Anuruddha<br/> and said this to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend Anuruddha, to what extent<br/> are the four arisings of mindfulness undertaken?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>
