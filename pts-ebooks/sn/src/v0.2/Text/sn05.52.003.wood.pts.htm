    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Anuruddha was staying on the bank of the river Sutanu<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> at Sāvatthī</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span> Now a number of monks came to visit the venerable Anuruddha,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously and,<br/> after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated those monks said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"By cultivating<br/> and making much of what conditions<br/> has the venerable Anuruddha<br/> attained great supernormal power?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, it is by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> four arisings of mindfulness<br/> that I have done so.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, friends, I dwell in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also, friends, I dwell in feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I dwell in mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I dwell in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> these four arisings of mindfulness, friends,<br/> that I have come by great supernormal power.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, friends, by cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> these four arisings of mindfulness,<br/> I can recognize a mean state as mean,<br/> a middling state as middling,<br/> and an excellent state as excellent."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
