    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the venerable Anuruddha.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Anuruddha addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, these four arisings of mindfulness,<br/> if cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to the destruction of craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also he dwells in feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells in mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">He dwells in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, these four arisings of mindfulness,<br/> if cultivated<br/> and made much of,<br/> conduce to the destruction of craving.</p>
