    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī at Sāl-tree Hut.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Friends, take the case of the river Ganges<br/> which flows to the east,<br/> slides to the east,<br/> tends to the east.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then there comes a great crowd of folk<br/> with pick and basket<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"We will make this river Ganges<br/> flow,<br/> slide<br/> and tend to the west."</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think ye, friends?</p>

    <p class="f4">Could that great crowd of folk<br/> make the river Ganges<br/> flow,<br/> slide<br/> and tend to the west?'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely not, friend.</p>

    <p class="f4">And why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is because, as the river Ganges<br/> flows,<br/> slides<br/> and tends to the east,<br/> it were no easy thing<br/> to make it flow<br/> slide<br/> tend to the west:<br/> insomuch that fatigue and vexation<br/> would be the lot<br/> of that great crowd of folk.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Just so, friends,<br/> in the case of a monk<br/> who is cultivating the four arisings of mindfulness<br/> and making much of them,<br/> suppose the rajah's royal ministers<br/> or his friends<br/> or boon-companions<br/> or kinsmen<br/> or blood-relations<br/> were to come to <span class="f2 g"><b>[267]</b></span> that monk<br/> and tempt him<br/> with the offer of wealth,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come, good man!</p>

    <p class="f4">Why should these yellow robes torment you?</p>

    <p class="f4">Why parade about<br/> with shaven crown and bowl?</p>

    <p class="f4">Come!<br/> Return to the lower life,<br/> enjoy possessions<br/> and do deeds of merit."</p>

    <p class="f4">But, friends, for that monk,<br/> who is cultivating<br/> and making much of<br/> the four arisings of mindfulness,<br/> to reject the training<br/> and return to the lower life<br/> were a thing impossible.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, friends,<br/> as that monk's heart has<br/> for many a long day<br/> been flowing,<br/> sliding,<br/> tending to seclusion,<br/> for him to return to the lower life<br/> were a thing impossible.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, friends,<br/> does a monk cultivate,<br/> make much of,<br/> the four arisings of mindfulness?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, friends,<br/> a monk dwells in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> being ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting;</p>

    <p class="f4">contemplating feelings in feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> being ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting;</p>

    <p class="f4">contemplating mind in mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> being ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting;</p>

    <p class="f4">contemplating mind-states in mind-states (as transient),<br/> (as transient),<br/> being ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, friends, is how a monk cultivates, makes much of the four arisings of mindfulness.'</p>
