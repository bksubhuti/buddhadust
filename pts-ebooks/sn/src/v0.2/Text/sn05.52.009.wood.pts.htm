    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Anuruddha and Sāriputta were staying at Vesālī, in Ambapālī's Grove.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> rising from his solitude at eventide,<br/> went to visit the venerable Anuruddha,<br/> and on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat he said this to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Serene, friend Anuruddha, is your air!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Very clear and shining is your complexion!</p>

    <p class="f4">In what manner of living does the venerable Anuruddha<br/> now generally spend his time?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, my mind is well grounded<br/> in four arisings of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how I generally spend my time.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span> Herein, friends, I dwell in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also, friends, I dwell in feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I dwell in mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I dwell in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is in these four arisings of mindfulness, friend,<br/> that my mind is well grounded,<br/> and that is how I generally spend my time.</p>

    <p class="f4">Friend, the monk who is Arahant,<br/> who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/> who has lived the life,<br/> done his task,<br/> lifted the burden,<br/> won his own welfare,<br/> who has worn out the fetters of becoming,<br/> who has won full realization<br/> and is liberated, -<br/> such an one generally spends his time<br/> with mind well grounded<br/> in these four arisings of mindfulness."</p>

    <p class="f4">"A gain for us, friend!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well gotten by us, friend,<br/> that face to face with the venerable Anuruddha<br/> we have heard him utter<br/> his lordly utterance!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>
