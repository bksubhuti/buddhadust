    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī<br/> in Dark Wood,<br/> being sick and grievously afflicted.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a number of monks came to visit the venerable Anuruddha,<br/> and on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side thy said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray what is the venerable Anuruddha's life,<br/> in that the painful feelings that come upon him<br/> make no impression on his mind?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, it is because I dwell<br/> with my mind well grounded<br/> in four arisings of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is why the painful feelings that come upon me<br/> make no impression on my mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, friends, I dwell in body contemplating body<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also, friends, I dwell in feelings contemplating feelings<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I dwell in mind contemplating mind<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">I dwell in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/> (as transient),<br/> ardent,<br/> self-possessed<br/> and mindful,<br/> by restraining the dejection in the world<br/> that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is because I thus dwell, friends,<br/> that the painful feelings that come upon me<br/> make no impression on my mind."</p>
