    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a number of monks came to visit the venerable Anuruddha,<br/> and on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As they thus sat<br/> those monks said this to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

    <p class="f4">'By cultivating and making much of what conditions<br/> has the venerable Anuruddha<br/> come by great supernormal power?</p>

    <p class="f4">Friends, it is by cultivating and making much of<br/> four arisings of mindfulness<br/> that I have come by great supernormal power.</p>
