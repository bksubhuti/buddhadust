    <p class="f4">Of the earnest monk<br/> it may be expected<br/> that he will cultivate,<br/> that he will make much of<br/> the four trances.</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monks,<br/> does a monk who is earnest<br/> cultivate<br/> and make much of<br/> the four trances?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein a monk, aloof from sensuality,<br/> aloof from evil states,<br/> enters on the first trance<br/> which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/> born of solitude,<br/> zestful and easeful,<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/> he enters on that inward calm,<br/> that one-pointedness of mind,<br/> apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/> that is born of mental balance,<br/> zestful and easeful,<br/> which is the second trance,<br/> and abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br/> he abides indifferent,<br/> mindful and composed,<br/> and experiences ease through the body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having entered on the third trance,<br/> which the Ariyans describe in these terms:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He who is indifferent and mindful dwells happily,' -<br/> he abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, by the abandoning of ease,<br/> by the abandoning of discomfort,<br/> by the ending of the happiness and unhappiness that he had before,<br/> entering on that state which is neither pleasant nor painful,<br/> that utter purity of mindfulness reached by indifference,<br/> which is the fourth trance,<br/> he abides therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monks, a monk who is earnest<br/> cultivates<br/> and makes much of<br/> the four trances.</p>
