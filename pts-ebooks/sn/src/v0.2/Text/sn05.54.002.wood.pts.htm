    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there is one condition which,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> is of great fruit,<br/> of great profit.</p>

    <p class="f4">How cultivated?</p>

    <p class="f4">Under this rule,<br/> a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness<br/> accompanied by concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/> which tends to seclusion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is Norm-investigation,<br/> accompanied by concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/> which tends to seclusion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/> which tends to seclusion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/> which tends to seclusion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/> which tends to seclusion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/> which tends to seclusion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity,<br/> which tends to seclusion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> that ends in self-surrender.</p>

    <p class="f4">If thus cultivated and made much of, monks,<br/> the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/> is of great fruit,<br/> of great profit.'</p>
