    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there is one condition which,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> is of great fruit,<br/> of great profit.</p>

    <p class="f4">How cultivated?</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, under this rule,<br/> a monk who goes to a forest<br/> or the foot of a tree<br/> or a lonely place,<br/> sits down cross-legged,<br/> holding the body straight.<br/> Setting mindfulness in front of him,<br/> he breathes in mindfully<br/> and mindfully breathes out.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he draws in a long breath he knows:<br/> A long breath I draw in.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he draws in a short breath he knows:<br/> A short breath I draw in.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he breathes out a short breath he knows:<br/> I breathe out a short breath.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):<br/> "I shall breathe in,<br/> feeling it go through the whole body.<br/> Feeling it go through the whole body<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/> I shall breathe in.<br/> Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/> I shall breathe out."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):<br/> "Feeling the thrill of zest<br/> I shall breathe in.<br/> Feeling the thrill of zest<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/> I shall breathe in.<br/> Feeling the sense of ease<br/> I shall breathe out."</p>

    <p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating): "Aware of all mental factors<br/> I shall breathe in.<br/> Aware of all mental factors<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/> I shall breathe in.<br/> Calming down the mental factors<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe in.<br/> Aware of mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He makes up his mind (repeating):<br/> "Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in.<br/> Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.<br/> Composing my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.<br/> Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He makes up his mind (repeating):<br/> "Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in.<br/> Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in.<br/> Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe in.<br/> Contemplating cessation I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in.<br/> Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus cultivated, monks,<br/> thus made much of,<br/> the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/> is of great fruit,<br/> of great profit.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, if concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/> be thus cultivated,<br/> thus made much of,<br/> these seven fruits may be looked for.</p>

    <p class="f4">What seven?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this very life, previously,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/> one establishes gnosis,<br/> and if not in this same life, previously,<br/> then one does so at the moment of death.</p>

    <p class="f4">If not at the moment of death,<br/> then, by having worn down the five fetters<br/> of the lower sort,<br/> he is one who wins release midway.</p>

    <p class="f4">Failing that,<br/> he does so by reduction of his time.</p>

    <p class="f4">Failing that he passes away without much trouble</p>

    <p class="f4">Or failing that he passes away with some trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4">If he do none of these,<br/> he is 'one who goes upstream,'<br/> and he is reborn in the Pure Abodes.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the seven fruits,<br/> the seven profits<br/> to be looked for<br/> if concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/> be cultivated and made much of.</p>
