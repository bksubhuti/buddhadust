    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, do ye practise concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing?'</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words the venerable Ariṭṭha said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I, lord, do practise it.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'But in what way do you practise it, Ariṭṭha?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Thus, lord. I abandon sensual desire for lusts that are past. Sensual desire for lusts to come is vanished. Both inwardly and outwardly the consciousness of repugnance for things is perfectly disciplined.<span class="f3"><sup>12</sup></span> Mindful I breathe in, mindful I breathe out.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span> That, lord, is how I practise concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'True, Ariṭṭha. That is concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing. And yet I-declare it is not. Now, Ariṭṭha, I will tell you how concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing is done perfectly, every detail. Do you listen to it. Apply your mind and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will, lord,' replied the venerable Ariṭṭha to the Exalted One. The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, Ariṭṭha, how is concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing done perfectly, in every detail?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this method, Ariṭṭha, a monk who goes to the forest or the foot of a tree, or a lonely place, sits down cross-legged ... <i>(as in § i)</i> ... "contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out."</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Ariṭṭha, is how concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing is done perfectly, in every detail.'</p>
