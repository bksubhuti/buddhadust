    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[279]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Kappina the Great<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> was not far off, sitting cross-legged, holding his body erect, with mindfulness set in front of him.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One saw the venerable Kappina sitting not far off, sitting cross-legged, holding his body erect, with mindfulness set in front of him and on seeing him he said to the monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, do ye ever see any wavering or shaking of body in this monk?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, so far as we have seen him, whether sitting amid the Order or sitting alone and solitary, we have never observed any wavering or shaking of body in that venerable one.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[280]</b></span> 'Monks, it is by the fact of cultivating and making much of such concentration that there is no wavering or shaking of body that this monk can attain at will such concentration, can attain it without difficulty, attain it without trouble.</p>

    <p class="f4">And by cultivating and making much of what sort of concentration is there no wavering and shaking of body? It is by cultivating and making much of the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing that such is the result. And how cultivated, how made much of does such concentration have such a result?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this method, monks, a monk who has gone to a forest or the root of a tree,<br/> or a lonely place,<br/> sits down cross-legged,<br/> holding the body straight.<br/> Setting mindfulness in front of him,<br/> he breathes in mindfully<br/> and mindfully breathes out.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he draws in a long breath he knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">A long breath I draw in.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he draws in a short breath he knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">A short breath I draw in.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he breathes out a short breath he knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">I breathe out a short breath.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

    <p class="f4">"I shall breathe in,<br/> feeling it go through the whole body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling it go through the whole body<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/> I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/> I shall breathe out."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Feeling the thrill of zest<br/> I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling the thrill of zest<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/> I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/> I shall breathe out."</p>

    <p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Aware of all mental factors<br/> I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Aware of all mental factors<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/> I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">"He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, monks, is how, when one cultivates and makes much of the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, there is no wavering or shaking of body, no wavering or shaking of mind.'</p>
