    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard: On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Kimbilā, in Bamboo Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One addressed the venerable Kimbilā, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Tell me, Kimbilā, how cultivated, how made much of, is the practice of intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing of great fruit, of great profit?'</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words the venerable Kimbilā was silent.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a second time and a third time the Exalted One addressed the venerable Kimbilā (in the same words, and on each occasion the venerable Kimbilā was silent).</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now is the time for this, Exalted One! Now is the time, O Happy One, for the Exalted One to develop the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing. Hearing the Exalted One's words the monks will bear them in mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Very well then, .Ānanda. Do you listen. Apply your mind and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied the venerable .Ānanda to the Exalted One, who said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'How cultivated, Ānanda, how made much of is the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing of great fruit, of great profit?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this method, Ānanda, a monk who goes to the forest ... <i>(as in § 1)</i>...</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus cultivated, Ānanda, thus made much of, the intent concentration ... is of great fruit, of great profit.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, at such time as a monk, while drawing in a long breath, knows: A long breath I draw in; or, breathing out a long breath, knows: A long breath I breathe out; or, when drawing in a short breath, knows: A short breath I draw in; or, when breathing out a short breath, knows: A short breath I breathe out; or, when he makes up his mind (repeating): "Feeling it go through the whole body I shall breathe in; feeling it go through the whole body I shall breathe out; calming down<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a></sup></span> the bodily aggregate I shall breathe in; calming down the bodily aggregate I shall breathe out," — at such time, Ānanda, in body contemplating body (as transient) a monk dwells ardent, self-possessed and mindful, by restraining the dejection in the world that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, I declare that this in-breathing and out-breathing is a certain body.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a></sup></span> Wherefore, .Ānanda, a monk in body contemplating/body ... at such time dwells ardent, self-possessed and mindful... .</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, at such time as a monk makes up his mind (repeating): "Feeling the thrill of zest I shall breathe in: feeling the thrill of zest I shall breathe out: feeling the sense of ease I shall breathe in: feeling the sense of ease I shall breathe out. Aware of the mental factors I shall breathe in: aware of the mental factors I shall breathe out. Calming down the mental factors I shall breathe in: calming down the mental factors I shall breathe out," — at such time, in feelings contemplating feelings, he dwells ardent, self-possessed; and mindful, by restraining ...</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, I declare that this in-breathing and out-breathing, this close attention to it, is a certain feeling.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a></sup></span> Wherefore, Ānanda, a monk, in feelings contemplating feelings, at such time dwells ardent, self-possessed and mindful...</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, at such time as a monk makes up his mind (repeating): "Aware of mind I shall breathe in: aware of mind I shall breathe out. Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in: gladdening my mind I shall breathe out. Composing my mind I shall breathe in: composing my mind I shall breathe out. Detaching my mind I shall breathe in: detaching my mind I shall breathe out," — at such time, in mind contemplating mind (as transient), a monk dwells ardent, self-possessed and mindful, by restraining the dejection in the world that arises from coveting. What is the cause of that?</p>

    <p class="f4">I declare, Ānanda, that the practice of intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing is not a mindfulness that is relaxed or not composed. Wherefore, Ānanda, I say a monk dwells in mind contemplating mind, ardent, self-possessed and mindful... .</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, at such time as a monk makes up his mind (repeating): "Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in: contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out. Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in: contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out. Contemplating cessation I shall breathe in: contemplating cessation' I shall breathe out. Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in: contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out," — at such time, in mind-states contemplating mind-states, a 'monk dwells ardent, self-possessed and mindful, by restraining ... .</p>

    <p class="f4">Abandoning whatever dejection arises from coveting, seeing it<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a></sup></span> with the eye of insight, he is completely disinterested.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore I say, Ānanda, at such a time that monk dwells in mind-states contemplating mind-states, ardent, self-possessed , and mindful, by restraining the dejection in the world that arises from coveting.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, Ānanda, a heap of dust at the place where four high-roads meet, and from the eastern quarter comes a cart or chariot, and that heap of dust is made less. Then from the western quarter ... from the northern and southern quarters comes a cart or chariot, and that heap of dust is made still less, — just so, Ānanda, by dwelling in body contemplating body ... by dwelling in feelings contemplating feelings ... in mind contemplating mind ... in mind-states contemplating mind-states, evil, unprofitable conditions are made less.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a></sup></span>'</p>
