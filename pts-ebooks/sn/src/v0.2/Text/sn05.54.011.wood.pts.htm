    <p class="f4">On a certain, occasion the Exalted One was staying at Icchānangala,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a></sup></span> in a jungle thicket of Icchānangala.</p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I wish to live in solitude for three months. Let no one visit me save the single one who brings my food.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Very well, lord,' replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus no one visited the Exalted One save the single one who brought his food.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at the end of those three months the Exalted One, leaving his solitary dwelling, came and addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if the wanderers who hold other views should thus question you:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, in what way of life does Gotama the recluse generally spend the rainy season?"</p>

    <p class="f4">thus questioned,<br/> thus should ye make reply to those wanderers holding other views:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, the Exalted One generally spends his time during the rainy season in the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, monks, in this method I mindfully breathe in and mindfully breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">When I draw along breath I know:<br/> A long breath I draw in.</p>

    <p class="f4">When I breathe out a long breath I know:<br/> A long breath I breathe out...</p>

    <p class="f4"><i>(as at § 1)</i> ... "contemplating renunciation I breathe out."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, he who would rightly use the words</p>

    <p class="f4">"Ariyan way of life,<br/> best of<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a></sup></span> ways,<br/> the Tathāgata's way of life"</p>

    <p class="f4">would rightly do so in calling by this name the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Ariyan way of life,<br/> the best of ways,<br/> the Tathāgata's way of life."</p>

    <p class="f4">As for those monks who are learners,<br/> who have not won their goal,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a></sup></span><br/> who dwell aspiring for tile unsurpassed security from bondage,<br/> — for such the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> conduces to the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks, for those monks who are Arahants,<br/> in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br/> who have lived the life,<br/> done the task,<br/> lifted the burden,<br/> won their highest good,<br/> worn out the fetters of becoming,<br/> who by perfect knowledge have become free,<br/> — for such also the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> conduces both to pleasant living<br/> and to<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a></sup></span> mindful composure even in this very life.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, he who would rightly use the words</p>

    <p class="f4">"Ariyan way,<br/> best of ways,<br/> the Tathāgata's way of life"</p>

    <p class="f4">would rightly do so in calling by this name the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Ariyan way of life,<br/> the best way of life,<br/> the Tathāgata's way of life."'</p>
