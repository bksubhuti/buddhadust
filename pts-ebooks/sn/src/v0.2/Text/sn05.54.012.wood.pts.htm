    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Lomasavangīsa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a></sup></span> was living among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu, in Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Mahānāma<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a></sup></span> the Sakyan came to see the venerable Lomasavangīsa,and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the venerable Lomasavangīsa:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sir, is a learner's way of life the same as that of a Tathāgata,<br/> or are the two different?'</p>

    <p class="f4">'No indeed, friend Mahānāma,<br/> a learner's way of life is not that of a Tathāgata.</p>

    <p class="f4">The two are different.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[291]</b></span> Those monks, friend Mahānāma, who are learners,<br/> who have not won their goal,<br/> who dwell aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage,<br/> — such dwell having abandoned five hindrances.</p>

    <p class="f4">What five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The hindrances which are sensual desire,<br/> resentment,<br/> sloth and torpor,<br/> excitement and worry,<br/> doubt and wavering.</p>

    <p class="f4">Those monks, friend, who are learners,<br/> who have not won their goal,<br/> who dwell aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage,<br/> — such have abandoned these hindrances.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, friend Mahānāma,<br/> those monks who are Arahants,<br/> in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br/> who have lived the life,<br/> done the task,<br/> lifted the burden,<br/> won their highest good,<br/> worn out the fetters of becoming,<br/> who by perfect knowledge have become free,<br/> — in such these five hindrances are not only abandoned,<br/> but cut down at the root,<br/> made like a palm-tree stump,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so as not to grow again in future time.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the five?</p>

    <p class="f4">The hindrances which are sensual desire,<br/> resentment,<br/> sloth and torpor,<br/> excitement and flurry,<br/> doubt and wavering,<br/> are in them abandoned,<br/> cut down at the root,<br/> made like a palm-tree stump,<br/> made something that has ceased to be,<br/> so as not to grow again in future time.</p>

    <p class="f4">In this way, friend Mahānāma,<br/> you are to understand that the learner's way of life is one thing,<br/> the Tathāgata's way of life another thing.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on a certain occasion, friend Mahānāma,<br/> the Exalted One was staying at Icchānangala<br/> in a jungle thicket of Icchānangala.</p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, I wish to live in solitude for three months.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let no one visit me save the single one who brings my food.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'Very well, lord,' replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus no one visited the Exalted One save the single one who brought his food.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at the end of those three months the Exalted One,<br/> leaving his solitary dwelling,<br/> came and addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if the wanderers who hold other views should thus question you:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, in what way of life does Gotama the recluse generally spend the rainy season?"</p>

    <p class="f4">thus questioned,<br/> thus should ye make reply to those wanderers holding other views:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, the Exalted One generally spends his time during the rainy season<br/> in the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing."</p>

    <p class="f4">'Now, monks, in this method<br/> I mindfully breathe in<br/> and mindfully breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">When I draw along breath I know:<br/> A long breath I draw in.</p>

    <p class="f4">When I breathe out a long breath I know:<br/> A long breath I breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus I make up my mind (repeating):</p>

    <p class="f4">"I shall breathe in,<br/> feeling it go through the whole body.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling it go through the whole body<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/> I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/> I shall breathe out."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus I make up my mind (repeating):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Feeling the thrill of zest<br/> I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling the thrill of zest<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/> I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/> I shall breathe out."</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus I make up my mind (repeating):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Aware of all mental factors<br/> I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Aware of all mental factors<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/> I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/> I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus I make up my mind (repeating):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus I make up my mind (repeating):</p>

    <p class="f4">"Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in.</p>

    <p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, he who would rightly use the words</p>

    <p class="f4">"Ariyan way of life,<br/> best of ways,<br/> the Tathāgata's way of life"</p>

    <p class="f4">would rightly do so in calling by this name the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Ariyan way of life,<br/> the best of ways,<br/> the Tathāgata's way of life."</p>

    <p class="f4">As for those monks who are learners,<br/> who have not won their goal,<br/> who dwell aspiring for tile unsurpassed security from bondage,<br/> — for such the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> conduces to the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, monks, for those monks who are Arahants,<br/> in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br/> who have lived the life,<br/> done the task,<br/> lifted the burden,<br/> won their highest good,<br/> worn out the fetters of becoming,<br/> who by perfect knowledge have become free,<br/> — for such also the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/> if cultivated and made much of,<br/> conduces both to pleasant living<br/> and to mindful composure even in this very life.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, he who would rightly use the words</p>

    <p class="f4">"Ariyan way,<br/> best of ways,<br/> the Tathāgata's way of life"</p>

    <p class="f4">would rightly do so in calling by this name the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">"The Ariyan way of life,<br/> the best way of life,<br/> the Tathāgata's way of life."'</p>

    <p class="f4">So by this method, friend Mahānāma, you are to understand that the learner's way of life is one thing,<br/> that of the Tathāgata another thing.'</p>
