    <p class="f4"><span class="f3"></span>THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side. So seated the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Pray, lord, is there any one state which, if cultivated and made much of, brings four states to completion?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do four states, if cultivated and made much of, complete seven states?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do seven states, if cultivated and made much of, complete two states?'</p>

    <p class="f4">Yes, Ānanda. There is one state which does complete four. Four states complete seven, and seven complete two.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are they?.</p>

    <p class="f4">Intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, Ānanda, is the one state which, if cultivated and made much of, brings the four arisings of mindfulness to completion.</p>

    <p class="f4">The four arisings of mindfulness, if cultivated and made much of, bring the seven limbs of wisdom to completion.</p>

    <p class="f4">The seven limbs of wisdom, if cultivated and made much of, complete knowledge and release.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="ctr">I</p>

    <p class="f4">And how cultivated, how made much of, does intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing complete the four arisings of mindfulness?</p>

    <p class="f4">In this method, Ānanda, a monk who has gone to the forest or the root of a tree, or a lonely place, sits down cross-legged ... <i>(as in § i)</i> ... and makes up his mind (repeating): "contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, Ānanda, at such time as a monk, in drawing in a long breath, knows:</p>

    <p class="f4">(The whole as before to the end of Chap. I, omitting the simile of the dust heap)... .</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus cultivated, Ānanda, thus made much of, intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing completes the four arisings of mindfulness.</p>

    <p class="ctr">II<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And how cultivated ... do the four arisings of mindfulness complete the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

    <p class="f4">At such time as a monk dwells, in body contemplating body, with mindfulness established, his mindfulness is not relaxed; at such time as his mindfulness, being established, is not relaxed, the limb of wisdom which is mindfulness is established in that monk. Then it is, Ānanda, that a monk is cultivating the limb of wisdom which is mindfulness. Then it is that the limb of wisdom which is mindfulness by cultivation goes to completion in a monk. He, thus dwelling mindful, investigates that state by insight, he examines it, he comes to close scrutiny of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">At such time, Ānanda, as a monk, thus dwelling mindful, investigates that state by insight,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a></sup></span> comes to close scrutiny of it, then it is that the limb of wisdom which is Norm-investigation is undertaken by a monk; then it is that a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom which is Norm-investigation. Then it is, Ānanda, that the limb of wisdom which is Norm-investigation goes to completion in a monk. As he investigates that state by insight, as he examines it, as he comes to close scrutiny of it, unwavering energy is established in him.</p>

    <p class="f4">At such time, Ānanda, as unwavering energy is established in a monk who is investigating that state by insight, examining it, coming to close scrutiny of it, then it is that the limb of wisdom which is energy is established in that monk. Then it is that he cultivates that limb of wisdom: that limb of wisdom goes to completion in that monk owing to cultivation of it; and there arises in him a zest that is not carnal<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a></sup></span> for the energy which he has established.</p>

    <p class="f4">At such time, Ānanda, as zest that is not carnal arises in a monk whose energy is established, the limb of wisdom which is zest is established in him: then it is that a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom which is zest. At such time the limb of wisdom which is zest goes to completion in that monk owing to cultivation of it. In one who is zestful the body is tranquillized, the mind is tranquillized.</p>

    <p class="f4">At such time, Ānanda, as the body and mind of a monk who is zestful<span class="f3"><sup>45</sup></span> are tranquillized, the limb of wisdom which is tranquillity is established in him. At such time a monk cultivates this limb of wisdom: it goes to completion in a monk by cultivation. In him whose body is tranquillized, who is happy, the mind is composed.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn46" href="#n46">46</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">When, Ānanda, in a monk whose body is tranquillized, who is happy, the mind is composed, at such time the limb of wisdom which is concentration is established in him: he thus cultivates this limb of wisdom, it goes to completion in him. He is a thoroughly disinterested onlooker<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn47" href="#n47">47</a></sup></span> of his mind thus composed.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, when a monk is a thoroughly disinterested onlooker of his mind thus composed, at such time the limb of wisdom which is equanimity is established in him: it is then that he cultivates this limb of wisdom, it is then that this limb of wisdom goes to completion in him by cultivation of it.</p>

    <p class="f4">At such time, Ānanda, as a monk dwells in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient), with mindfulness established, at such, time his mindfulness is not relaxed. When his mindfulness is established and not relaxed... <i>(all as for body)</i>.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn48" href="#n48">48</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Thus cultivated, Ānanda, thus made much of, the four arisings of mindfulness complete the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

    <p class="ctr">III</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, how cultivated, how made much of, do the seven limbs of wisdom complete knowledge and release?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom which is mindfulness, which tends to seclusion, to dispassion, to cessation, to readiness for self-surrender... he cultivates the limb of wisdom which is equanimity... .</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus cultivated ... the seven limbs of wisdom complete knowledge and release.'</p>
