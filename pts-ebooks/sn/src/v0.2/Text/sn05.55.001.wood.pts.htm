    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, although a rājah,<br/> a roller of the wheel,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> holding supreme lordship and dominion<br/> over four continents,<br/> on the break-up of body<br/> is reborn after death in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World,<br/> in the company of the Devas of the Thirty-Three;<br/> although he spends his time there<br/> in Nandana Grove,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> attended by a troop of nymphs,<br/> supplied and provided with,<br/> surrounded by,<br/> celestial pleasures of sense;<br/> although he is possessed of these four things,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> -<br/> yet is he not released<br/> from Purgatory,<br/> he is not released<br/> from (birth in) the womb of an animal,<br/> he is not released<br/> from the realm of ghosts,<br/> he is not released<br/> from Hell,<br/> the Way of Woe,<br/> the Downfall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, although an Ariyan disciple<br/> lives on gathered scraps,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> though he be clothed in rags,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/> yet is he possessed of four things;<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[297]</b></span> moreover be is released<br/> from Purgatory,<br/> be is released<br/> from (birth in) the womb of an animal,<br/> he is released<br/> from the realm of ghosts,<br/> he is released<br/> from Hell,<br/> the Way of Woe,<br/> from the Downfall.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four things?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br/> of unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">(He has faith that)</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He is possessed of unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is possessed of unwavering faith in the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he is possessed<br/> of the virtues loved by the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such are the four things he is possessed of.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, there is the winning of four continents,<br/> and there is the winning of the four things.</p>

    <p class="f4">But to win four continents<br/> is not worth a sixteenth part<br/> of the winning of the four things."</p>
