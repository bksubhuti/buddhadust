    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, blessed with four things an Ariyan disciple is a stream-winner,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall, one assured, one bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, an Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One’s Order of Disciples,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely, the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, —<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">Blessed with these four things, monks,<br/> the Ariyan disciple is a stream-winner,<br/> one not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> one assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having thus spoken, the Happy One, as teacher, said this:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Whoso have faith and virtue, loyalty<br/> And insight of the Norm, — in time<span class="f3"><sup>2</sup></span> they win<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> The bliss in which the holy life is steeped.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The bliss in which the holy life is steeped, <i>i.e Nibbāna.</i> For <i>ogadha, cf. jagatogadha, S.</i> i, 186 ('based on earth'): <i>amatogadhaṁ</i> ('plunging into the Deathless’). <i>Comy.</i> <i>'Ogadhitvā ṭhitaṁ, uparimaggattāya sampayuttaṁ sukhaṁ.'</i> Text has, as alternative title to this Sutta, <i>Saṭayhaṁ</i> (as in the <i>uddana</i>), which I cannot translate.

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Text misprints <i>kālena</i> as <i>kāle na (paccanti).</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Paccanti</i> of text should be <i>paccenti = paṭienti;</i> or <i>paṭiyanti,</i> which = <i>pāpuṇanti, Comy.</i></p>
