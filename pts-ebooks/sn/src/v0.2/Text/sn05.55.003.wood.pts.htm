    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha,<br/> in Bamboo Grove,<br/> at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[299]</b></span> Now on that occasion Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br/> was sick<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br/> called to his father Jotika the house-father,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come, house-father!</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you go to the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him,<br/> with your head worship at the feet of the Exalted One,<br/> and say in my name:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Lord, Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br/> is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">He worships with his head<br/> at the Exalted One's feet.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It were a good thing, lord,<br/> if the Exalted One would come to the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br/> out of compassion for him.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very good, my lad,"<br/> said Jotika the house-father<br/> in reply to Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br/> and went to the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated, Jotika the house-father<br/> said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, Dīghāvu the lay-disciple is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">He worships with his head<br/> at the feet of the Exalted One<br/> and says thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It were a good thing, lord,<br/> if the Exalted One would come<br/> to the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br/> out of compassion for him.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">And the Exalted One consented by his silence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One robed himself,<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe<br/> set off for the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br/> and on arriving there<br/> sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having sat down<br/> the Exalted One said this<br/> to Dīghāvu the lay-disciple:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, Dīghāvu,<br/> I hope you are bearing up,<br/> I hope you are enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br/> and not increase?</p>

    <p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating<br/> and not increasing?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not bearing up.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating<br/> but of their increasing."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, Dīghāvu,<br/> thus must you train yourself:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will be blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">He it <span class="f2 g"><b>[300]</b></span> is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will be blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">I will be blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Also I will be blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Dīghāvu,<br/> is how you must train yourself."</p>

    <p class="f4">"As to these four limbs of stream-winning, lord,<br/> which have been taught by the Exalted One,<br/> all of those conditions<br/> are to be found in me,<br/> and I do live in accordance with them.</p>

    <p class="f4">Lord, I am indeed blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">I am indeed blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">I am indeed blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">I am indeed blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Therefore, Dīghāvu,<br/> resting on these four limbs of stream-winning,<br/> you should further practise<br/> the six conditions<br/> which are constituent parts of knowledge.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Dīghāvu, do you dwell<br/> contemplating impermanence<br/> in all the activities,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> conscious of ill<br/> in impermanence,<br/> conscious of there being no self<br/> in what is ill,<br/> conscious of abandoning,<br/> of dispassion,<br/> of cessation.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, Dīghāvu,<br/> is how you must train yourself."</p>

    <p class="f4">Lord, as to these same six conditions,<br/> which are constituent parts of knowledge,<br/> all of them are to be found in me.</p>

    <p class="f4">I do live<br/> contemplating impermanence<br/> in all the activities,<br/> conscious of ill<br/> in impermanence,<br/> conscious of there being no self<br/> in what is ill,<br/> conscious of abandoning,<br/> of dispassion,<br/> of cessation.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, lord, I have this thought:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I would not have the house-father Jotika here<br/> fall into dejection at my death.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Don't you trouble about that, Dīghāvu, my lad!<br/> (said his father).</p>

    <p class="f4">Look you, Dīghāvu, my lad!</p>

    <p class="f4">Attend closely to what the Exalted One is saying to you."</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span> So the Exalted One,<br/> having thus admonished Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br/> rose from his seat and went away.</p>

    <p class="f4">And not long after the Exalted One had gone<br/> Dīghāvu the lay-disciple made an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon a number of monks<br/> went to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, that lay-disciple named Dīghāvu,<br/> who was admonished in brief by the Exalted One,<br/> has made an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is his lot?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is his destiny in the life to come?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"A sage, monks, was Dīghāvu the lay-disciple.</p>

    <p class="f4">He lived according to the Norm.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He did not harm me<br/> by disputing about the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">Dīghāvu, the lay-disciple, monks,<br/> by wearing out the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> is reborn by spontaneous birth.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">His destiny<br/> is not to return from that world."</p>
