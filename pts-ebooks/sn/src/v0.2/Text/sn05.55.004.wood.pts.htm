    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Sāriputta<br/> and the venerable Ānanda<br/> were staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br/> rising up from his solitude at eventide,<br/> went to see the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said this:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Tell me, friend Sāriputta,<br/> through winning possession<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of what things<br/> are people of this world<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> as stream-winners,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> bound for enlightenment?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, it is because of winning four things<br/> that people of this world<br/> are proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> as stream-winners,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four things?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, friend, an Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">These, friend, are the four things.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to being blessed with these,<br/> people of this world<br/> are proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> as stream-winners,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> bound for enlightenment.</p>
