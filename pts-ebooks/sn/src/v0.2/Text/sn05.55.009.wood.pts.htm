    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Ñatika,<br/> in Brick Hall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Ānanda came to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, the monk named Asoka bas made an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is his lot?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is his destiny in the life to come?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Lord, the nun named Asokī has made an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is her lot?</p>

    <p class="f4">What is her destiny in the life to come?</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The monk Asoka, Ānanda,<br/> who has made an end,<br/> by destroying the <i>āsavas,</i><br/> in this very life,<br/> by his own understanding<br/> realized the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight,<br/> and attaining to it<br/> dwelt therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Asokī the nun, Ānanda,<br/> who has made an end,<br/> by wearing out the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> has taken birth spontaneously<br/> there to pass away,<br/> destined never to return thence.</p>

    <p class="f4">Indeed, Ānanda,<br/> it is no wonder<br/> that a human being should make an end.</p>

    <p class="f4">But if, when each one dies,<br/> you come and ask me about the matter,<br/> it is troublesome to the Tathāgata.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, I will teach you a Norm-teaching<br/> called 'The Mirror of the Norm,'<br/> possessing which<br/> the Ariyan disciple may,<br/> if he please,<br/> himself proclaim of himself<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Cut off for me is Purgatory,<br/> cut off is rebirth in an animal womb,<br/> cut off is the realm of ghosts,<br/> the Woeful Way and the Downfall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Stream-winner am I,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment!'</p>

    <p class="f4">And of what sort, Ānanda,<br/> is that Norm-teaching<br/> called 'Mirror of the Norm,'<br/> possessed of which<br/> the Ariyan disciple may,<br/> if he please,<br/> himself proclaim of himself<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Cut off for me is Purgatory,<br/> cut off is rebirth in an animal womb,<br/> cut off is the realm of ghosts,<br/> the Woeful Way and the Downfall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Stream-winner am I,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment!'?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is that Norm-teaching<br/> called 'Mirror of the Norm,' possessed of which which<br/> the Ariyan disciple may,<br/> if he please,<br/> himself proclaim of himself<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Cut off for me is Purgatory,<br/> cut off is rebirth in an animal womb,<br/> cut off is the realm of ghosts,<br/> the Woeful Way and the Downfall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Stream-winner am I,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment!'</p>
