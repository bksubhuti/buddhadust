    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, the brahmins proclaim this practice which leads to prosperity:<br/> they instruct their disciples in it thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come, good fellow!</p>

    <p class="f4">Rise up betimes<br/> and go facing east.</p>

    <p class="f4">Don't avoid a hole,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> a village pool<br/> or cesspit.</p>

    <p class="f4">You should go to meet your death<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> wherever you may fall.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, good fellow,<br/> on the break up of body,<br/> after death<br/> you will be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World.'</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, this practice of the brahmins<br/> is the way of fools,<br/> it is the way of infatuation.</p>

    <p class="f4">It conduces not to revulsion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> to calm,<br/> to full comprehension,<br/> to the wisdom,<br/> it conduces not to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, I too proclaim,<br/> in the Ariyan discipline,<br/> a practice which leads to prosperity,<br/> but it is one which conduces <span class="f2 g"><b>[316]</b></span> to downright revulsion,<br/> dispassion,<br/> cessation<br/> to calm,<br/> to full comprehension,<br/> to the wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what sort of practice<br/> is that which so leads?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has<br/> unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He has unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He has unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He has virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is the practice which leads to prosperity,<br/> one which conduces to downright revulsion,<br/> dispassion,<br/> cessation<br/> to calm,<br/> to full comprehension,<br/> to the wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna."</p>
