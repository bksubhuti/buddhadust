    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta<br/> and the venerable Ānanda<br/> were staying near Sāvatthī<br/> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta,<br/> rising from his solitude at eventide,<br/> went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/> the venerable Sāriputta said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend Ānanda,<br/> by abandoning what things,<br/> by winning possession of what things,<br/> are people of this world<br/> proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> as stream-winners,<br/> as not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> as assured,<br/> as bound for enlightenment?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friend, it is by abandoning four things,<br/> it is by winning possession of four things,<br/> that people of this world<br/> are proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> as stream-winners,<br/> as not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> as assured,<br/> as bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four things?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">One has no such disloyalty to the Buddha<br/> as that possessed by the uneducated manyfolk<br/> who, when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> are reborn in Hell,<br/> in the Woeful Lot,<br/> the Downfall,<br/> in Purgatory:<br/> but he has such unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/> as is possessed by the educated Ariyan disciple,<br/> who, when the body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> is reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">One has no such disloyalty to the Norm<br/> as that possessed by the uneducated manyfolk<br/> who, when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> are reborn in Hell,<br/> in the Woeful Lot,<br/> the Downfall,<br/> in Purgatory:<br/> but he has such unwavering loyalty to the Norm<br/> as is possessed by the educated Ariyan disciple,<br/> who, when the body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> is reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">One has no such disloyalty to the Order<br/> as that possessed by the uneducated manyfolk<br/> who, when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> are reborn in Hell,<br/> in the Woeful Lot,<br/> the Downfall,<br/> in Purgatory:<br/> but he has such unwavering loyalty to the Order<br/> as is possessed by the educated Ariyan disciple,<br/> who, when the body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> is reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[317]</b></span> He has no such immorality<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> as that possessed by the uneducated many folk<br/> who, when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> are reborn in Hell,<br/> in the Woeful Lot,<br/> the Downfall,<br/> in Purgatory:<br/> but he is blessed has virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind<br/> such as are possessed by the educated Ariyan disciple,<br/> who, when the body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> is reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World.</p>
