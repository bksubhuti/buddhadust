    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, those with whom you have sympathy,<br/> those who think you should be listened to,<br/> whether friends<br/> or intimates<br/> or kinsmen<br/> or blood-relations, -<br/> all such should be advised about,<br/> grounded in,<br/> established in<br/> four limbs of stream-winning.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">They should be advised about,<br/> grounded in,<br/> established in<br/> unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be change,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> monks,<br/> in the four great elements of earth,<br/> water,<br/> heat<br/> and air,<br/> but there can be no change<br/> in the Ariyan disciple<br/> blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha;</p>

    <p class="f4">by change I mean:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> -<br/> that such an one should be reborn in hell<br/> or the womb of an animal<br/> or in the realm of ghosts<br/> is an utter impossibility.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They should be advised about,<br/> grounded in,<br/> established in<br/> unwavering loyalty to the Norm<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be change, monks,<br/> in the four great elements of earth,<br/> water,<br/> heat<br/> and air,<br/> but there can be no change<br/> in the Ariyan disciple<br/> blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm;</p>

    <p class="f4">by change I mean: -<br/> that such an one should be reborn in hell<br/> or the womb of an animal<br/> or in the realm of ghosts<br/> is an utter impossibility.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They should be advised about,<br/> grounded in,<br/> established in<br/> unwavering loyalty to the Order<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be change, monks,<br/> in the four great elements of earth,<br/> water,<br/> heat<br/> and air,<br/> but there can be no change<br/> in the Ariyan disciple<br/> blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order;</p>

    <p class="f4">by change I mean: -<br/> that such an one should be reborn in hell<br/> or the womb of an animal<br/> or in the realm of ghosts<br/> is an utter impossibility.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">They should be advised about, grounded in, established in the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">There may be change, monks,<br/> in the four great elements of earth,<br/> water,<br/> heat<br/> and air,<br/> but there can be no change<br/> in the Ariyan disciple<br/> established in the virtues dear to the Ariyans;</p>

    <p class="f4">by change I mean: -<br/> that such an one should be reborn in hell<br/> or the womb of an animal<br/> or in the realm of ghosts<br/> is an utter impossibility.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"So monks, those with whom you have sympathy,<br/> those who think you should be listened to,<br/> whether friends<br/> or intimates<br/> or kinsmen<br/> or blood-relations, -<br/> all such should be advised about,<br/> grounded in,<br/> established in<br/> these four limbs of stream-winning."</p>
