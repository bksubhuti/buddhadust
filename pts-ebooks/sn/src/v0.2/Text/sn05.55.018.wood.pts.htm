    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/> just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br/> or draw in his outstretched <span class="f2 g"><b>[319]</b></span> arm, -<br/> even so did he vanish from Jeta Grove<br/> and appear among the Devas of the Thirty-Three.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then a number of the Devas of the Thirty-Three<br/> came to see the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and stood at one side.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">As they thus stood<br/> the venerable Moggallāna the Great said this to those Devas:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is a good thing, friends, to be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">As a result of being blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/> some beings here,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> are reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is a good thing, friends, to be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is a good thing, friends, to be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">As a result of being blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order<br/> some beings here,<br/> when body breaks up,<br/> after death<br/> are reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/> in the Heaven World.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is a good thing, friends, to be blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted,<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>
