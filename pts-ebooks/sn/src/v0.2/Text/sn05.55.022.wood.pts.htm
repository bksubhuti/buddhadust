    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu, in the Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan came to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.<br/> As he thus sat Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, this town of Kapilavatthu is rich,<br/> prosperous, populous,<br/> crowded with men,<br/> a dense mass of folk.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, lord, when I enter Kapilavatthu at eventide<br/> after waiting upon the Exalted One<br/> or the worshipful monks,<br/> I meet with elephants,<br/> horses, chariots,<br/> carts and men,<br/> all swaying and rolling along.</p>

    <p class="f4">At such times, lord, my thoughts,<br/> which are fixed on the Exalted One,<br/> on the Norm and the Order,<br/> are simply bewildered.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then it occurs to me:</p>

    <p class="f4">'If I were at this very moment to make an end,<br/> what would be my lot,<br/> what would be my destiny<br/> in the life to come?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Have no fears, Mahānāma!<br/> Have no fears, Mahānāma!</p>

    <p class="f4">Blameless will be your death.</p>

    <p class="f4">You will make a blameless end.</p>

    <p class="f4">For the Ariyan disciple, Mahānāma,<br/> who is blessed with four things,<br/> bends to Nibbāna,<br/> slopes to Nibbāna,<br/> tends to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four things?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Mahānāma,<br/> the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:<br/> He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant, a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is possessed<br/> of unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:<br/> Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is possessed<br/> of unwavering faith in the Order, thus:<br/> Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely, the four airs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.<br/> That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands,<br/> — a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he is possessed<br/> of the virtues loved by the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole, unspotted, untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">For instance, Mahānāma,<br/> if a tree bends to the east,<br/> slopes to the east,<br/> tends to the east,<br/> which way will it fall<br/> when its root is cut?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It will fall whither it bends,<br/> slopes and tends, lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just so, Mahānāma,<br/> the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with four things<br/> bends to Nibbāna,<br/> slopes to Nibbāna,<br/> tends to Nibbāna."</p>
