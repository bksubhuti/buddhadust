    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu,<br/> in the Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br/> who had made an end,<br/> was proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon a number of Sakyans,<br/> whenever they met <span class="f2 g"><b>[324]</b></span> together in company,<br/> were consumed with indignation,<br/> and spoke angrily and scornfully<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> about him<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"A strange thing indeed!</p>

    <p class="f4">A wonder indeed!</p>

    <p class="f4">Nowadays-anyone may become a stream-winner,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> inasmuch as Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br/> who bas died,<br/> is proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why! Sarakāni the Sakyan failed in the training<br/> and took to drink!"</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/> Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Here, lord, Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br/> who has died,<br/> was proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon a number of Sakyans, whenever they meet together in company,<br/> were consumed with indignation,<br/> and spoke angrily and scornfully about him<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A strange thing indeed!</p>

    <p class="f4">A wonder indeed!</p>

    <p class="f4">Nowadays-anyone may become a stream-winner,<br/> inasmuch as Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br/> who bas died,<br/> is proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why! Sarakāni the Sakyan failed in the training<br/> and took to drink!'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Mahānāma, a lay-disciple<br/> who has for a long time taken refuge in the Buddha,<br/> taken refuge in the Norm<br/> taken refuge in the Order, -<br/> how could such an one go to the Downfall?</p>

    <p class="f4">He who would rightly apply the words<br/> 'A lay-disciple who has gone for refuge to the Buddha,<br/> who has gone for refuge to the Norm<br/> who has gone for refuge to the Order'<br/> might rightly apply them to Sarakāni the Sakyan.</p>

    <p class="f4">Mahānāma, Sarakāni the Sakyan is one who<br/> for a long time took refuge in the Buddha,<br/> took refuge in the Norm<br/> took refuge in the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">How could such an one go to the Downfall?</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein, Mahānāma,<br/> take the case of a man<br/> who is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover he is one who is joyous<br/> and swift in wisdom,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> one who has won release.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now by the destruction <span class="f2 g"><b>[325]</b></span> of the āsavas,<br/> in this very life,<br/> by bis own understanding<br/> he bas realized the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight,<br/> and having attained it<br/> dwells therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such an one, Mahānāma,<br/> is fully released from hell,<br/> from rebirth in an animal's womb,<br/> from the realm of ghosts,<br/> he is fully released from the Waste,<br/> the Woeful Way,<br/> from the Downfall.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">But suppose again in this connexion, Mahānāma,<br/> a certain one who is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is joyous and swift in wisdom,<br/> but he has not won release.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet by destroying the five fetters of the lower sort<br/> he is spontaneously born<br/> (in the Pure Abodes),<br/> destined there to pass away,<br/> not to return hither from thence.</p>

    <p class="f4">This one too, Mahānāma,<br/> is fully released from hell,<br/> from rebirth in an animal's womb,<br/> from the realm of ghosts,<br/> he is fully released from the Waste,<br/> the Woeful Way,<br/> from the Downfall.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">But he is not joyous and swift in wisdom,<br/> he has not won release.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet by destroying three fetters<br/> and weakening lust,<br/> hatred<br/> and delusion<br/> he is a Once-returner.</p>

    <p class="f4">Once more he comes back to this world<br/> and makes an end of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">He too, Mahānāmatoo, Mahānāma,<br/> is fully released from hell,<br/> from rebirth in an animal's womb,<br/> from the realm of ghosts,<br/> he is fully released from the Waste,<br/> the Woeful Way,<br/> from the Downfall.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Mahānāma,<br/> suppose a certain man<br/> blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>
