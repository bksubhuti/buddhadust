    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu,<br/> in the Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br/> who had made an end,<br/> was proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon a number of Sakyans,<br/> whenever they met together in company,<br/> were consumed with indignation,<br/> and spoke angrily and scornfully about him<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">"A strange thing indeed!</p>

    <p class="f4">A wonder indeed!</p>

    <p class="f4">Nowadays-anyone may become a stream-winner,<br/> inasmuch as Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br/> who bas died,<br/> is proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why! Sarakāni the Sakyan failed in the training<br/> and took to drink!"</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/> Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Here, lord, Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br/> who has died,<br/> was proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon a number of Sakyans, whenever they meet together in company,<br/> were consumed with indignation,<br/> and spoke angrily and scornfully about him<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Why! Sarakāni the Sakyan failed in the training<br/> and took to drink!'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Mahānāma, a lay-disciple<br/> who has for a long time taken refuge in the Buddha,<br/> taken refuge in the Norm<br/> taken refuge in the Order, -<br/> how could such an one go to the Downfall?</p>

    <p class="f4">He who would rightly apply the words<br/> 'A lay-disciple who has gone for refuge to the Buddha,<br/> who has gone for refuge to the Norm<br/> who has gone for refuge to the Order'<br/> might rightly apply them to Sarakāni the Sakyan.</p>

    <p class="f4">Mahānāma, Sarakāni the Sakyan is one who<br/> for a long time took refuge in the Buddha,<br/> took refuge in the Norm<br/> took refuge in the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now herein, Mahānāma,<br/> take the case of a certain one<br/> who has reached absolute loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>
