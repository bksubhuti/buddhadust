    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now at that time the house-father Anāthapiṇḍika was sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the house-father Anāthapiṇḍika called to a certain man, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Come hither, good fellow!</p>

    <p class="f4">Go you to the venerable Ānanda,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> worship in my name<br/> with your head at the feet of the venerable Ānanda<br/> and say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Sir, the house-father Anāthapiṇḍika is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It were well, sir,<br/> if the venerable Ānanda would come to the house of the house-father Anāthapiṇḍika,<br/> out of compassion for him.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very well, master,"<br/> replied that man.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then he went to see the venerable Ānanda<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

    <p class="f4">Sir, the house-father Anāthapiṇḍika is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He says:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It were well, sir,<br/> if the venerable Ānanda would come to the house of the house-father Anāthapiṇḍika,<br/> out of compassion for him.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda consented by silence.</p>

    <p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda,<br/> robing himself in the forenoon<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe,<br/> set off for the dwelling of the house-father Anāthapiṇḍika,<br/> and on reaching it<br/> sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having sat down<br/> he said this to the house-father Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

    <p class="f4">Well, house-father!</p>

    <p class="f4">Are you bearing up?</p>

    <p class="f4">Are you enduring?</p>

    <p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br/> and not increase?</p>

    <p class="f4">Is there any sign of their abating<br/> and not increasing?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"No. sir, I am not enduring.</p>

    <p class="f4">I am not bearing up.</p>

    <p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating<br/> but of their increasing."</p>

    <p class="f4">Housefather, terror and trembling<br/> and fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter, -<br/> these come upon the uneducated manyfolk<br/> who have four qualities.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, house-father, the uneducated manyfolk have disloyalty to the Buddha.</p>

    <p class="f4">When they bethink them of their disloyalty to the Buddha,<br/> terror and trembling<br/> and fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter,<br/> come upon them.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, house-father, the uneducated manyfolk have disloyalty to the Norm.</p>

    <p class="f4">When they bethink them of their disloyalty to the Norm,<br/> terror and trembling<br/> and fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter,<br/> come upon them.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, house-father, the uneducated manyfolk have disloyalty to the Order.</p>

    <p class="f4">When they bethink them of their disloyalty to the Order,<br/> terror and trembling<br/> and fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter,<br/> come upon them.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, house-father, the uneducated manyfolk have immorality.</p>

    <p class="f4">When they bethink them of their immorality<br/> terror and trembling<br/> and fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter,<br/> come upon them.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, house-father, are the four things,<br/> possessed of which,<br/> terror and trembling<br/> and fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter,<br/> come upon the uneducated manyfolk.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, house-father, the educated Ariyan disciple,<br/> possessing four qualities,<br/> has no such terror and trembling<br/> and fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, house-father, the educated Ariyan disciple is blessed <br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it <span class="f2 g"><b>[300]</b></span> is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When he bethinks him of this unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/> which he is blessed with,<br/> no terror,<br/> no trembling,<br/> no fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter,<br/> comes upon him.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When he bethinks him of this unwavering loyalty to the Norm<br/> which he is blessed with,<br/> no terror,<br/> no trembling,<br/> no fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter,<br/> comes upon him.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When he bethinks him of this unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/> which he is blessed with,<br/> no terror,<br/> no trembling,<br/> no fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter,<br/> comes upon him.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When he bethinks him of these virtues dear to the Ariyans<br/> which he is blessed with,<br/> no terror,<br/> no trembling,<br/> no fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter,<br/> comes upon him.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, house-father, are the four possessions<br/> of the educated Ariyan disciple,<br/> possessing which,<br/> he has no terror and trembling<br/> and fear of death,<br/> as to what may be hereafter."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I am not afraid, master Ānanda!</p>

    <p class="f4">How could I be afraid?</p>

    <p class="f4">I have unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">I have unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, master Ānanda,<br/> as to those obligations binding on a house-father,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> pointed out by the Exalted One,<br/> I see not a single one of them<br/> which is broken in me."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well for you, house-father!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well gotten by you!</p>

    <p class="f4">You have declared the fruits of stream-winning, house-father."</p>
