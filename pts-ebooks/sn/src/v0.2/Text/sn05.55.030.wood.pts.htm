    <p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][than]</span>Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Vesālī,<br/> in Great Grove,<br/> at the House of the Peaked Gable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Nandaka, minister of the Licchavī,<br/> came to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br/> the Exalted One said this to Nandaka:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Nandaka, possessed of four things<br/> the Ariyan disciple is a Stream-winner,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Nandaka, an Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[336]</b></span> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Blessed with these four things<br/> the Ariyan disciple is also blessed with long life,<br/> both heavenly and human,<br/> blessed with beauty,<br/> blessed with happiness,<br/> blessed with good name,<br/> and blessed with sovereignty,<br/> both heavenly and human.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This, Nandaka, I know,<br/> not from hearsay of any recluse or brahmin,<br/> but I have ascertained it for myself,<br/> seen it for myself,<br/> understood it for myself,<br/> and so do I tell it you."</p>

    <p class="f4">Just then someone came up to Nandaka, the minister of the Licchavī,<br/> and said to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is time for your bath, my lord."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough of that, good fellow!"<br/> said Nandaka.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Enough of this outward washing!</p>

    <p class="f4">This inner washing<br/> shall be enough for me,<br/> to wit:<br/> this loyalty to the Exalted One."</p>
