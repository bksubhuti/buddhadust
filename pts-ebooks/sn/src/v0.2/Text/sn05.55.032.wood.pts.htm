    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four floods of merit,<br/> floods of good things,<br/> that bring happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has unwavering loyalty to the Buddha thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the first flood of merit,<br/> of good things,<br/> bringing happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, he has unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the second flood of merit,<br/> of good things,<br/> bringing happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, he has unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the third flood of merit,<br/> of good things,<br/> bringing happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monks, the Ariyan disciple lives at home<br/> with heart free from the taint of stinginess.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">He is open-handed,<br/> pure-handed,<br/> delighting in self-surrender,<br/> one to ask a favour of,<br/> delighting to share charitable gifts.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the fourth flood of merit,<br/> of good things,<br/> bringing happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the four floods of merit,<br/> floods of good things,<br/> that bring happiness.</p>
