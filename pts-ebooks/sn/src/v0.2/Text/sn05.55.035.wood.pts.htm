    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four deva-paths to the Devas,<br/> for the purification of impure beings,<br/> for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has unwavering loyalty to the Buddha thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the first deva-path to the Devas,<br/> for the purification of impure beings,<br/> for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, he has unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the second deva-path to the Devas,<br/> for the purification of impure beings,<br/> for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, he has unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the third deva-path to the Devas,<br/> for the purification of impure beings,<br/> for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then again, monks, the Ariyan disciple blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4"><i>[He thus reflects:</i></p>

    <p class="f4"><i>"What then is this deva-path to the devas?"</i></p>

    <p class="f4"><i>He understands thus:</i></p>

    <p class="f4"><i>"I have heard that non-malevolence is at present the held by devas to be most excellent,<br/> and then abandoned by me is malevolence towards,<br/> weak or sturdy.</i></p>

    <p class="f4"><i>Surely I live the deva-path Dhamma.</i>]<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">This is the fourth deva-path to the Devas,<br/> for the purification of impure beings,<br/> for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the four deva-paths to the Devas,<br/> for the purification of impure beings,<br/> for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward has erroneously omitted this paragraph. I have done a rough translation a hybrid Woodward/Olds/Bhk. Bodhi thing. Bhk. Bodhi has: <i>"He reflects thus: 'What now is the divine track of the devas?' He understands thus: 'I have heard that at present the devas hold non-oppression as supreme, and I do not oppress anyone, frail or firm. Surely I dwell possessing one of the divine tracks'"</i></p>
