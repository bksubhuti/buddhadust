    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, the devas are glad to talk<br/> to one who is blessed with four things.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now those devas<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> who,<br/> being likewise blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> have deceased here<br/> and risen up there,<br/> think thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/> with just the same unwavering loyalty to the Buddha as ourselves,<br/> who deceased there<br/> and rose up here.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So they say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come hither<span class="f3"><sup><a href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> into the company of the devas.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Norm<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves by the wise.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now those devas who,<br/> being likewise blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> have deceased here<br/> and risen up there,<br/> think thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/> with just the same unwavering loyalty to the Norm as ourselves,<br/> who deceased there<br/> and rose up here.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So they say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come hither into the company of the devas.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Order<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Those devas who,<br/> being likewise blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> have deceased here<br/> and risen up there,<br/> think thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/> with just the same unwavering loyalty to the Order as ourselves,<br/> who deceased there<br/> and rose up here.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So they say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come hither into the company of the devas.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Then one is blessed with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Those devas who,<br/> being likewise blessed the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> have deceased here<br/> and risen up there,<br/> think thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/> with just the same virtues dear to the Ariyans, as ourselves,<br/> who deceased there<br/> and rose up here.'</p>

    <p class="f4">So they say to him:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Come hither into the company of the devas.'</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, the devas are glad to talk to one who is blessed with these four things.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Bhk. Bodhi notes: <i>Woodward understands </i>sabhāgataṁ<i> to be resolvable into </i>sabhā + gataṁ,<i> "joined the company," but it is actually the accusative singular of the abstract noun </i>sabhāgatā,<i> "similarity."</i> He also notes regarding the concluding sentences: <i>Be and Ee have </i>ehi ti,<i> presumably understood as an imperative, while Se has </i>etīti,<i> which seems hard to explain. I suggest reading the singular future</i> ehiti and he constructs this sutta thus: <i>"... When the noble disciple possesses four things, the devas are elated and speak of his similarity [to themselves]. ...'As the noble disciple possesses the same confirmed confidence in the Buddha ~ that we possessed when we passed away there and were reborn here, he will come into the presence of the devas.'</i></p>
