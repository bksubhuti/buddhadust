    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Kapilavatthu,<br/> in Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Mahanama the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side<br/> he said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, how far is one a disciple?"</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[339]</b></span> "By going for refuge to the Buddha, Mahanama,<br/> to the Norm<br/> and to the Order,<br/> one is a disciple."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, lord, how far is a disciple virtuous?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"From the time when a disciple<br/> abstains from killing,<br/> abstains from stealing,<br/> abstains from wrong conduct in sensual lusts,<br/> abstains from falsehood<br/> abstains from addiction to the neglect caused by intoxicants, -<br/> thus far, Mahanama, a disciple is virtuous."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, lord, how far is a disciple a believer?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, Mahanama, a disciple believes in the wisdom of the Tathāgata,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far, Mahanama, a disciple is a believer."</p>

    <p class="f4">"But, lord, how far is a disciple given to generosity?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, Mahanama, a disciple dwells at home<br/> with a heart freed from the taint of stinginess.</p>

    <p class="f4">He is open-handed,<br/> pure-banded,<br/> delighting in self-surrender,<br/> one to ask a favour of,<br/> one who rejoices in the dispensing of charitable gifts.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far, Mahanama, a disciple is given to generosity."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, how far is a disciple blessed with insight?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Herein, Mahanama, a disciple is a sage,<br/> blessed with insight<br/> into the rise and fall of things,<br/> insight which is Ariyan,<br/> penetrating,<br/> going on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus far, Mahanama, a disciple is possessed of insight."</p>
