    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Kapilavatthu, in Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Exalted One, robing himself in the forenoon<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe,<br/> started off to the house of Kāḷigodhā,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Sakyan lady,<br/> and on arriving<br/> sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Kāḷigodhā, the Sakyan lady,<br/> came to the Exalted One<br/> and saluting him<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As she thus sat<br/> the Exalted One said this to her:</p>

    <p class="f4">"<i>Godhā,</i> the Ariyan woman disciple<br/> who is blessed with four things<br/> is a Stream-winner,<br/> one not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> one assured,<br/> one bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Godhā, the Ariyan woman disciple<br/> has unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted one.</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Godhā, the Ariyan woman disciple<br/> has unwavering loyalty to the the Norm, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Godhā, the Ariyan woman disciple<br/> has unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted one's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, —<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">She dwells at home<br/> with heart free from the taint of stinginess.</p>

    <p class="f4">She is open-handed,<br/> pure-handed,<br/> delighting in self-surrender,<br/> one to ask a favour of,<br/> one who delights<br/> in dispensing charitable gifts.</p>

    <p class="f4">Blessed with these four things, Godhā,<br/> the Ariyan woman disciple<br/> is a Stream-winner."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, as to these four limbs of stream-winning<br/> declared by the Exalted One,<br/> all of them are to be seen in me,<br/> and I do live according to those things.</p>

    <p class="f4">I do have unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted one.</p>

    <p class="f4">I do have unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">I do have unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted one's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, whatsoever gifts of charity<br/> are to be made in the family,<br/> they are shared fully and impartially<br/> by the virtuous and good."</p>

    <p class="f4">"That is a gain for you, Godhā!</p>

    <p class="f4">It is a thing well gotten for you, Godhā!</p>

    <p class="f4">You have declared the fruits of stream-winning, Godha!'</p>
