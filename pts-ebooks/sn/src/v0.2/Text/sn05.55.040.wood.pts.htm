    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Kapilavatthu, in Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Nandiya the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, lord, if an Ariyan disciple is<br/> in every way,<br/> altogether,<br/> <span class="f2 g"><b>[341]</b></span> in every respect<br/> and utterly,<br/> without the four limbs of stream-winning,<br/> can he in such case be called<br/> 'An Ariyan disciple who lives remiss?'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Of such an one, Nandiya, who<br/> in every way,<br/> altogether,<br/> in every respect<br/> and utterly,<br/> without the four limbs of stream-winning,<br/> I declare him to be one who stands without,<br/> in the ranks of the manyfolk.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, Nandiya, I will tell you<br/> how the Ariyan disciple is one who lives remiss<br/> and one who lives in earnest.</p>

    <p class="f4">Do you listen.</p>

    <p class="f4">Apply your mind<br/> and I will speak."</p>

    <p class="f4">"I will, lord,"<br/> replied Nandiya the Sakyan to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">"And how, Nandiya, is the Ariyan disciple<br/> one who dwells remiss?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Nandiya, the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is content with that unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> but he makes no further effort,<br/> either to get seclusion by day<br/> or meditation by night.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus dwells remiss<br/> he has no delight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Without delight in a thing<br/> there is no zest.</p>

    <p class="f4">Zest lacking,<br/> there is no calm.</p>

    <p class="f4">Without calm<br/> one dwells in discomfort.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him who dwells in discomfort<br/> the mind is not tranquillized.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the mind that is not tranquillized<br/> the teachings do not show clear.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the teachings being obscure to him<br/> he is reckoned one who dwells remiss.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, suppose the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is content with that unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> but he makes no further effort,<br/> either to get seclusion by day<br/> or meditation by night.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus dwells remiss<br/> he has no delight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Without delight in a thing<br/> there is no zest.</p>

    <p class="f4">Owing to the teachings being obscure to him<br/> he is reckoned one who dwells remiss.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, suppose the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is content with that unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> but he makes no further effort,<br/> either to get seclusion by day<br/> or meditation by night.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus dwells remiss<br/> he has no delight.</p>

    <p class="f4">Without delight in a thing<br/> there is no zest.</p>

    <p class="f4">Zest lacking,<br/> there is no calm.</p>

    <p class="f4">Without calm<br/> one dwells in discomfort.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, he is blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">He is content with that virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> but he makes no further effort,<br/> either to get seclusion by day<br/> or meditation by night.</p>

    <p class="f4">As he thus dwells remiss<br/> he has no delight.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[342]</b></span> And bow, Nandiya, does the Ariyan disciple<br/> dwell in earnest?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Nandiya, the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">In him that is delighted in a thing<br/> zest is born.</p>
