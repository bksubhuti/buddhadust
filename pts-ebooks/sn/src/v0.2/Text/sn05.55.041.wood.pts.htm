    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four floods of merit,<br/> floods of good things,<br/> that bring happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the first flood of merit.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the second flood of merit.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the third flood of merit.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the fourth flood of merit.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four floods.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[343]</b></span> Now it is no easy thing<br/> to reckon up the measure of merit<br/> that accrues to the Ariyan disciple<br/> who is blessed with these four floods of merit,<br/> these four floods of good things,<br/> that bring happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">One cannot say they are thus and thus in quantity.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nay, they are only to be described in terms like<br/> 'incalculable,<br/> boundless.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, monks, it is no easy thing<br/> to reckon the water in the mighty ocean thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'There are so many gallons of water,<br/> so many hundred,<br/> so many thousand,<br/> so many hundreds of thousand gallons of water in it.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Nay, one can only say of it:</p>

    <p class="f4">'It is a mighty mass of water,<br/> incalculable<br/> and boundless.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, monks,<br/> it is no easy thing to reckon up<br/> the measure of merit<br/> that accrues to the Ariyan disciple<br/> who is blessed with these four floods of merit,<br/> these four floods of good things,<br/> that bring happiness.</p>

    <p class="f4">One cannot say they are thus and thus.</p>

    <p class="f4">Nay, they are only to be described in terms like<br/> 'incalculable,<br/> boundless.'"</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">"The mighty sea, unmeasured mighty lake,<br/> The fearsome home of multitudes of pearls, -<br/> 'As rivers, serving countless hosts of men,<br/> Flow widely forth and to that ocean come:<br/> Just so on him that giveth food, drink, clothes,<br/> Who bed and seat and coverlet provides,<br/> Torrents of merit flood that mortal wise,<br/> As rivers, bearing water, reach the Main."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
