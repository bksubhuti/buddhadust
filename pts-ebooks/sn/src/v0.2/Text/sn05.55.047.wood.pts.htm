    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Kapilavatthu, in Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Nandiya the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side the Exalted One said this to Nandiya the Sakyan:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Nandiya the Ariyan disciple who is Blessed with four things<br/> is a Stream-winner,<br/> one not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> bound for enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four things?</p>

    <p class="f4">Herein, Nandiya, the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">He is blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">These are the four things<br/> blessed with which<br/> the Ariyan disciple is a Stream-winner,<br/> one not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> bound for enlightenment."</p>
