    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">On that occasion a certain monk<br/> who had just spent the rainy season near Sāvatthī,<br/> had come to Kapilavatthu<br/> on some business or other.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard it said<br/> that a certain monk<br/> who had spent the rainy season at Sāvatthī<br/> was come to Kapilavatthu.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br/> went to visit that monk,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the Sakyans said this to that monk:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, is the Exalted One well and strong?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"He is, friends."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, are Sāriputta and Moggallāna<br/> well and strong?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"They are, friends."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Pray, sir, is the Order of Monks well and strong?" <span class="f2 g"><b>[347]</b></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"They are, friends."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Sir, during this retreat of the rainy season,<br/> have you beard anything<br/> face to face with the Exalted One?</p>

    <p class="f4">Have you learned anything from him?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, friends. I have heard<br/> and learned this<br/> face to face with the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, few indeed are those monks,<br/> who, by destroying the āsavas,<br/> have of themselves<br/> in this very life<br/> by their own knowledge<br/> realized the heart's release,<br/> the release by insight,<br/> and abide therein.</p>

    <p class="f4">More numerous are those monks<br/> who, by destroying the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> are reborn spontaneously<br/> (in the higher worlds),<br/> there to pass utterly away,<br/> destined not to return from that world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, friends, I heard this<br/> face to face with the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, few indeed are those monks<br/> who, by destroying the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/> are reborn spontaneously<br/> (in the higher worlds),<br/> there to pass utterly away,<br/> not destined to return from that world.</p>

    <p class="f4">More numerous are those monks<br/> who, by destroying three fetters<br/> and wearing down lust,<br/> hatred<br/> and delusion,<br/> are Once-returners.</p>

    <p class="f4">Coming back once more to this world<br/> they will make an end of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Further, friends, I learned this<br/> face to face with the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, few are those monks<br/> who, by destroying three fetters<br/> and wearing down lust,<br/> hatred<br/> and delusion,<br/> are Once-returners,<br/> who, coming back once more to this world,<br/> shall make an end of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">More numerous are those monks<br/> who, by destroying three fetters,<br/> are Stream-winners,<br/> not doomed to the Downfall,<br/> assured,<br/> bound for enlightenment.'"</p>
