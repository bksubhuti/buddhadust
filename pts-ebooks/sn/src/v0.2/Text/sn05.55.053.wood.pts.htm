    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Benares,<br/> at Isipatana,<br/> in the Deer Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then Dhammadinna<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the lay-disciple<br/> came with five hundred <span class="f2 g"><b>[348]</b></span> lay-disciples<br/> to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">As they thus sat,<br/> Dhammadinna the lay-disciple<br/> said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Let my lord the Exalted One admonish us!</p>

    <p class="f4">Let my lord the Exalted One admonish us,<br/> that it may be for our profit and welfare<br/> for many a long day."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, Dhammadinna, thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

    <p class="f4">As to those discourses<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> uttered by the Tathāgata,<br/> deep,<br/> deep in meaning,<br/> transcendental<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> and concerned with the Void,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> from time to time<br/> we will spend our days learning them.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how you must train yourselves, Dhammadinna."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, it is no easy thing for us,<br/> living as we do<br/> in crowded houses,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> encumbered with children,<br/> enjoying the use of Benares sandal-wood,<br/> decking ourselves with garlands and unguents,<br/> handling gold and silver, -<br/> it is no easy thing for us<br/> from time to time<br/> to spend our days<br/> learning those discourses uttered by the Tathāgata,<br/> deep,<br/> deep in meaning,<br/> transcendental<br/> and concerned with the Void.</p>

    <p class="f4">Let my lord the Exalted One<br/> teach us some other teaching,<br/> to us who stand firm in the five precepts."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Then, Dhammadinna,<br/> ye must train yourselves in this way:</p>

    <p class="f4">'We shall be blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">We shall be blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">We shall be blessed<br/> with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">We shall be blessed<br/> with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">That is how you must train yourselves, Dhammadinna."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, as to these four limbs of stream-winning taught by the Exalted One,<br/> those conditions are seen to exist in us already.</p>

    <p class="f4">We do live according to them.</p>
