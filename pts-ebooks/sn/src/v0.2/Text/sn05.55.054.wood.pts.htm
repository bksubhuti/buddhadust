    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Kapilavatthu, in Banyan Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/> a number of monks were busied<br/> making robes for the Exalted One,<br/> 'for,' said they,<br/> 'when the rains are over,<br/> the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan heard it said:</p>

    <p class="f4">'A number of monks are busied<br/> making robes for the Exalted One,<br/> "for," said they,<br/> "when the rains are over,<br/> the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds"<br/> and he went to the Exalted One,<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> Mahanama the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">I hear it said, lord,<br/> that a number of monks are busied<br/> making robes for the Exalted One<br/> with the idea that,<br/> when the rains are over,<br/> the Exalted One will set forth on his rounds.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, lord, we have never heard<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> from the Exalted One's own lips<br/> how a discreet<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> lay-disciple who is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease,<br/> should be admonished by another discreet lay-disciple."</p>

    <p class="f4">"A discreet lay-disciple, Mahānāma,<br/> who is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease,<br/> should be admonished by another discreet lay-disciple<br/> with the four comfortable assurances,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Take comfort, dear sir,<br/> in your unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/> Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One,<br/> perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/> a Happy One,<br/> world-knower,<br/> unsurpassed charioteer<br/> of men to be tamed,<br/> teacher of devas and mankind,<br/> a Buddha,<br/> an Exalted One.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Take comfort, dear sir, in your unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/> is the Norm,<br/> seen in this very life,<br/> a thing not involving time,<br/> inviting one to come and see,<br/> leading onward,<br/> to be known for themselves<br/> by the wise.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Take comfort, dear sir,<br/> in your unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/> thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/> walking uprightly,<br/> walking in the right way,<br/> walking dutifully<br/> is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/> namely,<br/> the four pairs of men,<br/> the eight sorts of men.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

    <p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/> worthy of reverence,<br/> worthy of offerings,<br/> worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/> a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Take comfort, dear sir, in your possession of the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> virtues unbroken,<br/> whole,<br/> unspotted,<br/> untarnished,<br/> giving freedom,<br/> praised by the wise:<br/> virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/> which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

    <p class="f4">A discreet lay-disciple, Mahānāma,<br/> who is sick,<br/> afflicted,<br/> suffering from a sore disease,<br/> should be <span class="f2 g"><b>[350]</b></span> admonished by another discreet lay-disciple<br/> with these four comfortable assurances.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, supposing he has longing for his parents,<br/> he should thus be spoken to:</p>

    <p class="f4">If he say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I have longing for my parents,'</p>

    <p class="f4">the other should reply:</p>

    <p class="f4">'But, my dear sir,<br/> you are subject to death.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whether you feel longing for your parents or not,<br/> you will have to die.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Twere just as well for you<br/> to abandon the longing you have<br/> for your parents.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If he should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That longing for my parents<br/> is now abandoned,'</p>

    <p class="f4">the other should reply:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Yet, my dear sir,<br/> you still have longing for your children.</p>

    <p class="f4">As you must die in any case,<br/> 'twere just as well for you<br/> to abandon that longing for your children.'</p>

    <p class="f4">If he should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That longing for my children<br/> is now abandoned,'</p>

    <p class="f4">the other should reply:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yet my dear sir,<br/> you still have longing<br/> for the five human pleasures of sense.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, if he say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'That longing for the five human pleasures of sense<br/> is now abandoned,'</p>

    <p class="f4">the other should reply:</p>

    <p class="f4">'My friend, the heavenly delights<br/> are more excellent<br/> than the five human pleasures of sense.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Twere well for you, worthy sir,<br/> to remove your thoughts from them<br/> and fix them on the Four Deva Kings.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose the sick man say:</p>

    <p class="f4">And if the sick man say be bas done so,<br/> then, <i>Mahānāma.</i> I declare<br/> that there is no difference<br/> between the lay-disciple who thus averse<br/> and the monk whose heart is freed from the āsavas,<br/> that is, between the release of the one<br/> and the release of the other."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
