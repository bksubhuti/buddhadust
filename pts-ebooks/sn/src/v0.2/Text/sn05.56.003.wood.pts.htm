    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever clansmen have<br/> in time past<br/> rightly gone forth from the home<br/> to the homeless life, -<br/> all of them have done so<br/> to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths,<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen shall<br/> in future time<br/> rightly go forth from the home<br/> to the homeless life, -<br/> all of them will do so<br/> to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths,<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[353]</b></span> Monks, whatsoever clansmen<br/> do now<br/> rightly go forth from the home<br/> to the homeless life, -<br/> all of them do so<br/> to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the arising of ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the practice<br/> that leads to the ceasing of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever clansmen have<br/> in time past<br/> rightly gone forth from the home<br/> to the homeless life, -<br/> all of them have done so<br/> to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths,<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen shall<br/> in future time<br/> rightly go forth from the home<br/> to the homeless life, -<br/> all of them will do so<br/> to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths,<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen<br/> do now<br/> rightly go forth from the home<br/> to the homeless life, -<br/> all of them do so<br/> to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
