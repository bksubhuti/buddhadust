    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> in time past<br/> have declared that they have in very truth<br/> gained the highest wisdom,<br/> all of them have declared<br/> that they have penetrated<br/> in very truth,<br/> the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses<br/> in future time<br/> will declare that they have in very truth<br/> gained the highest wisdom,<br/> all of them will declare<br/> that they have penetrated<br/> in very truth,<br/> the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins<br/> in the present time<br/> do declare that they have in very truth<br/> gained the highest wisdom,<br/> all of them do declare<br/> that they have penetrated<br/> in very truth,<br/> the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the arising of ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the practice<br/> that leads to the ceasing of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> in time past<br/> have declared that they have in very truth<br/> gained the highest wisdom,<br/> all of them have declared<br/> that they have penetrated<br/> in very truth,<br/> the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses<br/> in future time<br/> will declare that they have in very truth<br/> gained the highest wisdom,<br/> all of them will declare<br/> that they have penetrated<br/> in very truth,<br/> the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins<br/> in the present time<br/> do declare that they have in very truth<br/> gained the highest wisdom,<br/> all of them do declare<br/> that they have penetrated<br/> in very truth,<br/> the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
