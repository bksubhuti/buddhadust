    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, think not evil,<br/> unprofitable thoughts,<br/> such as:<br/> thoughts of lust,<br/> thoughts of hatred,<br/> thoughts of delusion.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Why do I say so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, monks,<br/> these thoughts are not concerned with profit,<br/> they are not the rudiments of the holy life,<br/> they conduce not to revulsion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> to tranquillity,<br/> to full understanding,<br/> to the perfect wisdom,<br/> they conduce not to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">When ye do think, monks,<br/> ye should think thus:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice<br/> that leads to the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Why do I say this?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, monks,<br/> these thoughts are concerned with profit,<br/> they are rudiments of the holy life,<br/> they conduce to revulsion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> to tranquillity,<br/> to full understanding,<br/> to the perfect wisdom,<br/> they conduce to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice<br/> that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
