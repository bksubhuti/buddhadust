    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Benares, at Isipatana, in the Deer-Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One thus spoke unto the company of five monks:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, these two extremes should not be followed<br/> by one who has gone forth as a wanderer.<br/> What two?</p>

    <p class="f4">Devotion to the pleasures of sense,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> a low practice of <span class="f3"><b>[357]</b></span> villagers,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> a practice unworthy, unprofitable,<br/> the way of the world<br/> (on the one hand);<br/> and (on the other)<br/> devotion to self-mortification,<br/> which is painful,<br/> unworthy<br/> and unprofitable.</p>

    <p class="f4">By avoiding these two extremes<br/> the Tathāgata has gained knowledge of that middle path<br/> which gives vision,<br/> which giveth knowledge,<br/> which causes calm,<br/> special knowledge,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/> enlightenment,<br/> Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is that middle path<br/> which gives vision,<br/> which giveth knowledge,<br/> which causes calm,<br/> special knowledge,<br/> enlightenment,<br/> Nibbāna?</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily it is this Ariyan eightfold way, to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is that middle path<br/> which gives vision,<br/> which giveth knowledge,<br/> which causes calm,<br/> special knowledge,<br/> enlightenment,<br/> Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now this, monks, is the Ariyan truth about Ill:</p>

    <p class="f4">Birth is Ill,<br/> decay is Ill,<br/> sickness is Ill,<br/> death is Ill:<br/> likewise sorrow and grief,<br/> woe, lamentation and despair.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">To be conjoined with things which we dislike:<br/> to be separated from things which we like,<br/> — that also is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not to get what one wants,<br/> — that also is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">In a word,<br/> this body,<br/> this fivefold mass which is based on grasping,<br/> — that is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now this, monks, is the Ariyan truth<br/> about the arising of Ill:</p>

    <p class="f4">It is that craving that leads back to birth,<br/> along with the lure and the lust<br/> that lingers longingly now here, now there: namely,<br/> the craving for sensual pleasure,<br/> the craving to be born again,<br/> the craving for existence to end.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such, monks, is the Ariyan truth<br/> about the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">And this, monks,<br/> is the <span class="f3"><b>[422]</b></span> Ariyan truth<br/> about the ceasing of Ill:</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily it is the utter passionless cessation of,<br/> the giving up,<br/> the forsaking,<br/> the release from,<br/> the absence of longing<br/> for this craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now this, monks,<br/> is the Ariyan truth<br/> about the practice<br/> that leads to the ceasing of Ill:</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily it is this Ariyan eightfold way, to wit:<br/> Right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, at the thought<br/> of this Ariyan truth of Ill,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, at the thought:<br/> This Ariyan truth about Ill<br/> is to be understood,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, at the thought:<br/> This Ariyan truth about Ill<br/> has been understood (by me),<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, at the thought<br/> of this Ariyan truth<br/> about the arising of Ill,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">At the thought:<br/> This arising of Ill<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/> is to be put away,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">At the thought:<br/> This arising of I11<br/> has been put away,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, at the thought<br/> of this Ariyan truth<br/> about the ceasing of Ill,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">At the thought:<br/> This ceasing of Ill<br/> must be realized,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">At the thought:<br/> This Ariyan truth about the ceasing of Ill<br/> has been realized,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, at the thought<br/> of this Ariyan truth<br/> about the <b>[359]</b> practice<br/> leading to the ceasing of Ill,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">At the thought:<br/> This Ariyan truth<br/> about the practice<br/> leading to the ceasing of Ill<br/> must be cultivated,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">At the thought:<br/> This Ariyan truth<br/> about the practice<br/> leading to the ceasing of Ill<br/> has been cultivated,<br/> — concerning things unlearnt before,<br/> there arose in me vision,<br/> insight,<br/> understanding:<br/> there arose in me wisdom,<br/> there arose in me light.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now, monks, so long as my knowledge and insight<br/> of these thrice revolved twelvefold Ariyan truths,<br/> in their essential nature,<br/> was not quite purified,<br/> — so long was I not sure<br/> that in this world,<br/> together with its Devas,<br/> its Māras,<br/> its Brahmās,<br/> among the hosts of recluses and brahmins,<br/> of Devas and mankind,<br/> there was one enlightened<br/> with supreme enlightenment.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, so soon as my knowledge and insight<br/> of these thrice revolved twelvefold Ariyan truths,<br/> in their essential nature,<br/> was quite purified,<br/> — then, monks, was I assured<br/> what it is to be enlightened<br/> with supreme enlightenment<br/> with regard to the world and its Devas,<br/> its Māras,<br/> its Brahmās,<br/> and with regard to the hosts<br/> of recluses and brahmins,<br/> of Devas and mankind.<br/> Now knowledge and insight<br/> have arisen in me<br/> so that I know:<br/> Sure is my heart's release.<br/> This is my last birth.<br/> There is no more becoming for me.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One,<br/> and the company of five monks<br/> were glad and rejoiced at the words<br/> of the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now when this sermon had been spoken,<br/> there arose in the venerable Kondañña<br/> the pure and stainless eye<br/> to see the Norm, to wit:<br/> Whatsoever is of a nature to arise<br/> is likewise of a nature to cease.</p>

    <p class="f4">Moreover, when the foundation of the kingdom of the Norm<br/> had been thus established by the Exalted One,<br/> the Devas of the earth raised the cry:</p>

    <p class="f4">'At Benares, at Isipatana,<br/> in the Deer-Park,<br/> has been established by the Exalted One<br/> this kingdom of the Norm unsurpassed,<br/> this kingdom not to be overset<br/> by any recluse or brahmin,<br/> any Deva or Māra<br/> or Brahmā,<br/> or by anyone whatsoever in the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When the Devas of the Four Kings heard the cry<br/> of the Devas of the earth,<br/> they also raised the cry:</p>

    <p class="f4">'At Benares, at Isipatana,<br/> in the Deer-Park,<br/> has been established by the Exalted One<br/> this kingdom of the Norm unsurpassed,<br/> this kingdom not to be overset<br/> by any recluse or brahmin,<br/> any Deva or Māra<br/> or Brahmā,<br/> or by anyone whatsoever in the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">When the Devas of the Thirty-Three,<br/> the Yama Devas,<br/> the Devas of Delight,<br/> the Creative Devas,<br/> the Devas who rejoice in the works of other Devas,<br/> and the Devas of the company of Brahmā,<br/> heard the cry of the Devas of the Four Kings,<br/> they also raised the cry:</p>

    <p class="f4">'At Benares, at Isipatana,<br/> in the Deer-Park,<br/> has been established by the Exalted One<br/> this kingdom of the Norm <span class="f3"><b>[424]</b></span> unsurpassed,<br/> this kingdom not to be overset<br/> by any recluse or brahmin,<br/> any Deva or Māra<br/> or Brahmā,<br/> or by anyone whatsoever in the world.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus at that very hour,<br/> at that very moment,<br/> in an instant of time<br/> the cry reached even to the Brahma World,<br/> and this thousandfold world-system quaked<br/> and quaked again:<br/> it was shaken to and fro,<br/> and an immeasurable mighty radiance shone forth,<br/> surpassing even the magic power of the Devas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One uttered this solemn saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Kondañña indeed has understood!<br/> Kondañña indeed has understood! '</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus it was that the venerable Kondañña won his name of 'Kondañña-who-has-understood<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Sometimes translated as 'The setting rolling of the wheel of the Norm.' <i>Cf. Vin.</i> i, 10. [In his <i>Introd.</i> to <i>Buddhist Suttas</i>, Prof. R. D. erroneously ascribes this Sutta to <i>Aṅguttara N.</i>] Preached originally on the full-moon day of Āsā'ha (July-August), a festival still kept up in Ceylon.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The five co-wanderers were Kondañña, Vappa, Bhaddiya, Mahānāma, and Assaji.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Text has several misprints: <i>kāmesu kāmesu khallika-,</i> which should be <i>kāmesu kāma-sukh. ... puthujjanīko</i> ... and further on, <i>anupagamma.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Gammo = gāma-vasīnaṅ santako. Comy.</i></p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> These last omitted by the Vinaya version.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Here Burmese MSS. (<i>v.l.</i> of text) omit <i>Ariya-.</i> But we must omit ariya-saccaṅ; otherwise the text would mean 'the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill is to be put away.' <i>Craving</i> has to be put away. The frame has obscured the picture here.</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>Aññāta-Kondañña.</i> 'Hereupon,' says the Vinaya account, 'Kondañña asked for ordination, and it was given in these words: "Come, monk! Well proclaimed is the Norm. Live the holy life for the utter destruction of Ill." This was full ordination (<i>upasampadā</i>) for that venerable one.' Then Vappa and Bhaddiya gained insight, and a little later Mahānāma and Assaji. Thus here were six in the Order.</p>
