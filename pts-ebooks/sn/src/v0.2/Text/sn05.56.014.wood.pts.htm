    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth about Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about about the ceasing of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth about Ill?</p>

    <p class="f4">Ill, it should be said,<br/> is the six personal spheres of sense.</p>

    <p class="f4">What six?</p>

    <p class="f4">The sense-sphere of the eye,<br/> the sense-sphere of the ear,<br/> the sense-sphere of the nose,<br/> the sense-sphere of the tongue,<br/> the sense-sphere of the body,<br/> the sense-sphere of the mind.</p>

    <p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/> 'the Ariyan truth about Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is that craving<br/> that leads back to rebirth,<br/> along with the lure and the lust<br/> that linger longingly now here,<br/> now there:<br/> namely,<br/> the craving for sensual delight,<br/> the craving to be born again,<br/> the craving for existence to end.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth about the ceasing of Ill?</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[362]</b></span> Verily it is the utter passionless cessation of,<br/> the giving up,<br/> the forsaking,<br/> the release from,<br/> the absence of<br/> longing for this craving.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the Ariyan truth about the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill?</p>

    <p class="f4">Verily it is this Ariyan eightfold way,<br/> to wit:</p>

    <p class="f4">Right view,<br/> right aim,<br/> right speech,<br/> right action,<br/> right living,<br/> right effort,<br/> right mindfulness,<br/> right concentration.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">These, monks, are the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
