    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, do ye bear in mind<br/> the four Ariyan truths<br/> taught by me?"</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words a certain monk said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"I, lord, do bear in mind<br/> the Ariyan truths<br/> taught by the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="f4">And how, monk, do you bear in mind<br/> the four Ariyan truths<br/> taught by me?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Thus, lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br/> Ill is the first Ariyan truth<br/> taught by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This 'Ill'<br/> is not the first Ariyan truth<br/> taught by Gotama the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejecting this Ill<br/> as the first Ariyan truth,<br/> I will proclaim another Ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br/> the arising of Ill is the second Ariyan truth<br/> taught by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The arising of Ill<br/> is not the second Ariyan truth<br/> taught by Gotama the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejecting this arising of Ill<br/> as the second Ariyan truth,<br/> I will proclaim another arising of Ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br/> the ceasing of Ill<br/> is the third Ariyan truth<br/> taught by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The ceasing of Ill<br/> is not the third Ariyan truth<br/> taught by Gotama the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejecting this ceasing of Ill<br/> as the third Ariyan truth,<br/> I will proclaim another ceasing of Ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br/> the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/> is the fourth Ariyan truth<br/> taught by the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/> is not the fourth Ariyan truth<br/> taught by Gotama the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejecting this practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/> as the fourth Ariyan truth,<br/> I will proclaim another practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">That, lord, is how I bear in mind<br/> the Ariyan truths<br/> taught by the Exalted One."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well done, monk!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well done, monk!</p>

    <p class="f4">You rightly bear in mind<br/> the four Ariyan truths<br/> taught by me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Ill<br/> was indeed taught by me<br/> as the first Ariyan truth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or <span class="f2 g"><b>[364]</b></span> brahmin should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This 'Ill'<br/> is not the first Ariyan truth<br/> taught by Gotama the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejecting this Ill<br/> as the first Ariyan truth,<br/> I will proclaim another Ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The arising of Ill<br/> was taught by me<br/> as the the second Ariyan truth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The arising of Ill<br/> is not the second Ariyan truth<br/> taught by Gotama the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejecting this arising of Ill<br/> as the second Ariyan truth,<br/> I will proclaim another arising of Ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The ceasing of Ill<br/> was taught by me<br/> as the the third Ariyan truth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The ceasing of Ill<br/> is not the third Ariyan truth<br/> taught by Gotama the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">Rejecting this ceasing of Ill<br/> as the third Ariyan truth,<br/> I will proclaim another ceasing of Ill,'</p>

    <p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">The practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/> was the fourth Ariyan truth<br/> taught by me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'The practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/> is not the fourth Ariyan truth<br/> taught by Gotama the recluse.</p>

    <p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus, monk, do you bear in mind<br/> the four Ariyan truths<br/> taught by me.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
