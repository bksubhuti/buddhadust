    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a certain monk came to see the Exalted One<br/> on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/> and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/> sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Ignorance! Ignorance,' is the saying, lord.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, what is ignorance,<br/> and how far is one the victim of ignorance?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monk, being ignorant about Ill,<br/> its arising,<br/> its ceasing<br/> and about the practice that leads to its ceasing<br/> is called 'ignorance,'<br/> and one who is thus ignorant<br/> is a victim of ignorance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
