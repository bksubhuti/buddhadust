    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Vajjians at Koṭigāma.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"'Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> 'This is Ill';<br/> who understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> 'this is the arising of Ill';<br/> who understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> 'this is the ceasing of Ill';<br/> who understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> 'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill', -<br/> such are not reckoned as recluses<br/> among recluses<br/> nor as brahmins<br/> among brahmins,<br/> nor have those worthies,<br/> in this very life,<br/> of themselves realized<br/> by their own knowledge<br/> the reality of recluseship<br/> or of brahminhood.</p>

    <p class="f4">But whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> have understood,<br/> as it really is,<br/> 'This is Ill';<br/> who have understood,<br/> as it really is,<br/> 'this is the arising of Ill';<br/> who have understood,<br/> as it really is,<br/> 'this is the ceasing of Ill';<br/> who have understood,<br/> as it really is,<br/> 'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill', -<br/> such are not reckoned as recluses<br/> among recluses<br/> nor as brahmins<br/> among brahmins,<br/> nor have those worthies,<br/> in this very life,<br/> of themselves realized<br/> by their own knowledge<br/> the reality of recluseship<br/> or of brahminhood.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">Having thus spoken<br/> the Happy One added this as Teacher:</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">Who understand not Ill, and how Ill comes to be,<br/> And how Ill ceases utterly without remains,<br/> Nor know the Way that leads on to Ill's ending,<br/> Such lack the heart's release, they lack release by insight.<br/> Helpless to make an end, to birth and eld they go.</p>

    <p class="f4 in2">But understanding Ill and how Ill comes to be,<br/> And where Ill ceases utterly without remains,<br/> Knowing the Way that leads on to Ill's ending,<br/> Blessed with the heart's release, blessed with release by insight,<br/> They, able to end all, go not to birth and eld.</p>
