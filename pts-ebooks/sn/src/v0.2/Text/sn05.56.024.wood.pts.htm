    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever Arahants,<br/> fully enlightened ones,<br/> in past time<br/> had full understanding (of things)<br/> as they really are,<br/> all of them had full understanding<br/> of the four Ariyan truths<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever Arahants,<br/> fully enlightened ones,<br/> shall in future time<br/> have full understanding of things<br/> as they really are,<br/> all of them will have full understanding<br/> of the four Ariyan truths<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever Arahants,<br/> fully enlightened ones,<br/> do now fully understand things<br/> as they really are,<br/> all of them have full understanding<br/> of the four Ariyan truths<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth about Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about about the ceasing of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever Arahants,<br/> fully enlightened ones,<br/> in past time<br/> had full understanding (of things)<br/> as they really are,<br/> all of them had full understanding<br/> of the four Ariyan truths<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever Arahants,<br/> fully enlightened ones,<br/> shall in future time<br/> have full understanding of things<br/> as they really are,<br/> all of them will have full understanding<br/> of the four Ariyan truths<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever Arahants,<br/> fully enlightened ones,<br/> do now fully understand things<br/> as they really are,<br/> all of them have full understanding<br/> of the four Ariyan truths<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
