    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, in him who knows,<br/> in him who sees,<br/> do I declare the āsavas to be destroyed:<br/> not in him who knows not,<br/> who sees not.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what, monks, is the destruction of the āsavas<br/> in him who knows,<br/> who sees?</p>

    <p class="f4">In him who knows, who sees:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill',</p>

    <p class="f4">there is destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">In him who knows, who sees:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill',</p>

    <p class="f4">there is destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">In him who knows, who sees:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill',</p>

    <p class="f4">there is destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">In him who knows, who sees:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill',</p>

    <p class="f4">there is destruction of the āsavas.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
