    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, those for whom ye have fellow-feeling,<br/> those who may deem you worth listening to,<br/> your friends and colleagues,<br/> your kinsmen and blood-relations, -<br/> they ought to be roused to,<br/> admonished and established in,<br/> the comprehension of the four Ariyan truths<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth about Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about about the ceasing of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, those for whom ye have fellow-feeling,<br/> those who may deem you worth listening to,<br/> your friends and colleagues,<br/> your kinsmen and blood-relations, -<br/> they ought to be roused to,<br/> admonished and established in,<br/> the comprehension of the four Ariyan truths<br/> as they really are.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
