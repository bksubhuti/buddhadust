    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth about Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about about the ceasing of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now, monks, these four Ariyan truths are true,<br/> not false,<br/> not alterable.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is why they are called Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
