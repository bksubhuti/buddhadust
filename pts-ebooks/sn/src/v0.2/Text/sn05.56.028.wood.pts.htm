    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/> at Jeta Grove,<br/> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth about Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about about the ceasing of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">In the world<br/> with its Devas,<br/> its Māras,<br/> its Brahmās,<br/> its host of recluses and brahmins,<br/> of Devas and mankind,<br/> the Tathāgata is an Ariyan.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore are they called 'Ariyan truths.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>
