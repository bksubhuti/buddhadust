    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion<br/> a number of monks were staying among the Cetīs<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> at Sahajātā.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now on that occasion a number of elder monks,<br/> after going their rounds<br/> and eating their meal,<br/> were sitting in the pavilion.</p>

    <p class="f4">As they sat there in company<br/> their talk chanced to fall on this subject:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, he who sees Ill<br/> also sees the arising of Ill,<br/> he also sees the ceasing of Ill<br/> and the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words<br/> the venerable Gavampati said this<br/> to the elder monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Friends, I have heard this,<br/> I have learned this<br/> from the very lips of the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, whoso sees Ill<br/> sees also the arising of Ill,<br/> he also sees the ceasing of Ill<br/> and the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso seeth the arising of Ill<br/> sees also Ill,<br/> the ceasing of Ill<br/> and the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso seeth the ceasing of Ill<br/> sees also Ill,<br/> the arising of Ill<br/> and the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whoso seeth the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,<br/> he also sees Ill,<br/> the arising of Ill<br/> and the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
