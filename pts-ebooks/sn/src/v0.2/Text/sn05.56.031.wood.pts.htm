    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī in Siṅsapā Grove.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/> gathering up a few sinsapa leaves in his hand,<br/> said to the monks:</p>

    <p class="f4">What think ye, monks?</p>

    <p class="f4">Which are the more numerous,<br/> just this mere handful of Siṅsapā leaves I have here,<br/> or those in the grove overhead?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Very few in number, lord,<br/> are the leaves in the handful<br/> gathered up by the Exalted One:<br/> much more in number<br/> are those in the grove overhead."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just so, monks,<br/> much more in number<br/> are those things I have found out,<br/> but not revealed;<br/> very few<br/> are the things I have revealed.</p>

    <p class="f4">And why, monks, have I not revealed them?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because they are not concerned with profit,<br/> they are not rudiments of the holy life,<br/> they conduce not to revulsion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> to tranquillity,<br/> to full comprehension,<br/> to the perfect wisdom,<br/> to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">That is why I have not revealed them.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">And what is it, monks, that I have revealed?</p>

    <p class="f4">Just that</p>

    <p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice<br/> that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">And why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, monks,<br/> this is concerned with profit.</p>

    <p class="f4">It is the rudiments of the holy life.</p>

    <p class="f4">It does conduce to revulsion,<br/> to dispassion,<br/> to cessation,<br/> to tranquillity,<br/> to full comprehension,<br/> to the perfect wisdom.</p>

    <p class="f4">It does conduce to Nibbāna.</p>

    <p class="f4">Therefore have I revealed it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
