    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, if anyone should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Without penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br/> without penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br/> without penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill,<br/> without penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,<br/> I will make an utter end of Ill'</p>

    <p class="f4">it would be an impossibility for him to do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, if anyone should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will make a leaf-basket<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of acacia leaves<br/> or of Judas-tree leaves<br/> or of myrobalan leaves,<br/> and fetch water in it,<br/> or use them for a fan,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> it would be impossible for him to do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">'Even so<br/> for him to make an utter end of Ill<br/> without<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br/> without penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br/> without penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill,<br/> without penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,<br/> would be an impossibility.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, if anyone should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will make an utter end of Ill by penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br/> by penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br/> by penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill,<br/> by penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,'<br/> I will make an utter end of Ill'<br/> it could be done</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, if anyone should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will make a leaf-basket<br/> of lotus-leaves<br/> or pulasa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> leaves<br/> or creeper leaves,<br/> or make a fan of them,'<br/> it could be done.</p>

    <p class="f4">So also if one were to say:|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'I will make an utter end of Ill by penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br/> by penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br/> by penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill,<br/> by penetrating,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,'<br/> I will make an utter end of Ill'<br/> it could be done</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
