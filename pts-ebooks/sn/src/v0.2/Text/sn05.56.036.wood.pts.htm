    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, a man should cut up all the grass,<br/> sticks,<br/> branches<br/> and stalks in this Jambudīpa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> and gather them together in a heap;<br/> and thus heaped together,<br/> were to make stakes<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, having made stakes of them,<br/> suppose he spitted all the mighty creatures<br/> in the mighty ocean<br/> on the mighty stakes;<br/> likewise all the creatures of middle size<br/> on the stakes of middle size;<br/> likewise all the creatures of minute size<br/> on the stakes of minute size.</p>

    <p class="f4">All the bulky creatures<br/> in the mighty ocean might thus be used up:<br/> but, though he should use up<br/> and consume<br/> all the grass,<br/> sticks,<br/> branches<br/> and stalks in this Jambudīpa,<br/> yet would there still remain in the mighty ocean<br/> a majority of the minute animals<br/> which could not be impaled on stakes.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of the minuteness of their bodies.</p>

    <p class="f4">Even thus widespread<br/> is the ruin of things.</p>

    <p class="f4">Yet from such widespread ruin<br/> he is saved<br/> who has the gift of sight to see,<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> this is Ill,<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> this is the arising of ill,<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> this is the ceasing of ill,<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> India.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="demi"/>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward has clearly mistranslated this and I have altered it to make sense. His original is as follows:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, a man should cut up all the grass,<br/> sticks,<br/> branches<br/> and stalks in this Jambudīpa<br/> and gather them together in a heap;<br/> were to bind them together<br/> and make a stake thereof.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, having made a stake of them,<br/> suppose he spitted all the mighty creatures<br/> in the mighty ocean<br/> on mighty stakes;<br/> likewise all the creatures of middle size<br/> on stakes of middle size;<br/> likewise all the creatures of minute size<br/> on stakes of minute size.</p>
