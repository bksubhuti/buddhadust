    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, just as the dawn is the forerunner,<br/> the harbinger,<br/> of the arising of the sun,<br/> even so is right view the forerunner,<br/> the harbinger,<br/> of fully comprehending the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[374]</b></span> Of a monk who bas right view<br/> it may be expected<br/> that he will understand:|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill',<br/> as it really is;</p>

    <p class="f4">that he will understand:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill', as it really is;</p>

    <p class="f4">that he will understand:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill', as it really is;</p>

    <p class="f4">that he will understand:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill',<br/> as it really is.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
