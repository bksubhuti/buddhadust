    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"So long, monks, as moon and sun arise not in the world,<br/> so long is there no shining forth of great light,<br/> of great radiance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then is there gloom and darkness,<br/> a murk of gloom and darkness,<br/> no telling whether it is night or day,<br/> no telling of months<br/> or half-months<br/> and the seasons of the year.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, when moon and sun shine in the world,<br/> then is there a shining forth of great light,<br/> of great radiance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then is there no more gloom and darkness,<br/> no more murk of gloom and darkness,<br/> but one can tell whether it is night or day,<br/> one can tell the months<br/> and the half-months<br/> and the seasons of the year.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, monks, so long as a Tathāgata arises not in the world,<br/> even so long is there no shining forth of the light,<br/> of great radiance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then is there gloom and darkness,<br/> a murk of gloom and darkness,<br/> then is there no proclamation of the four Ariyan truths,<br/> no teaching,<br/> no setting forth,<br/> no establishing,<br/> opening up,<br/> analysing<br/> or making of them plain.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, as soon as a Tathāgata arises in the world,<br/> then is there a shining forth of great light,<br/> of great radiance.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then is there no more gloom and darkness,<br/> no more murk of gloom and darkness;<br/> then is there proclamation of the four Ariyan truths,<br/> then is there teaching,<br/> setting forth,<br/> establishing,<br/> opening up,<br/> analysing<br/> and making of them plain.</p>

    <p class="f4">Of what four Ariyan truths?</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
