    <p><span class="f2 g"><b>[375]</b></span></p>

    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">such maybe scan the face<br/> of<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> some recluse or brahmin<br/> and conclude:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely this worthy<br/> is one who knowing knows<br/> and seeing sees!'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Just as, monks,<br/> a tuft of cotton-wool<br/> or a ball of thistledown,<br/> lightly wafted on the wind,<br/> is cast down on level ground,<br/> and the east wind whirls it west,<br/> and the west wind whirls it east,<br/> the north wind whirls it south<br/> and the south wind whirls it north.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, it is the lightness<br/> of the ball of thistledown.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, monks,<br/> whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill;'|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">such maybe scan the face<br/> of some recluse or brahmin and conclude:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely this worthy<br/> is one who knowing knows<br/> and seeing sees!'</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is through not seeing clearly the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But whatsoever recluses or brahmins do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">such scan not the face<br/> of some recluse or brahmin<br/> and conclude:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely this worthy<br/> is one who knowing knows<br/> and seeing sees!'</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Again, monks, just as an iron pillar<br/> or threshold of a door<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> or some deep-set pedestal<br/> is unshakable,<br/> unquakable:<br/> if there came from the eastern quarter<br/> a violent blast of wind and rain,<br/> it could not shake it,<br/> could not make it quake<br/> and quake again;<br/> if there came from the western quarter<br/> a violent blast of wind and rain,<br/> it could not shake it,<br/> could not make it quake<br/> and quake again;<br/> if there came from the northern quarter<br/> a violent blast of wind and rain,<br/> it could not shake it,<br/> could not make it quake<br/> and quake again;<br/> if there came from the southern quarter<br/> a violent blast of wind and rain,<br/> it could not shake it,<br/> could not make it quake<br/> and quake again.</p>

    <p class="f4">Why not?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because, monks, that threshold is deep set,<br/> that pedestal is deep set.</p>

    <p class="ctr c">■</p>

    <p class="f4">Even so, monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">such need not to scan not the face<br/> of some recluse or brahmin<br/> and <span class="f2 g"><b>[376]</b></span> conclude:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Surely this worthy<br/> is one who knowing knows<br/> and seeing sees!'</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because of seeing clear<br/> the four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
