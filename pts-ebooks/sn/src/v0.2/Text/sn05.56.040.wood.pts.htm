    <p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever monk understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">suppose from the east<br/> there comes a recluse or brahmin<br/> looking for dogma,<br/> searching for dogma,<br/> in hopes of refuting such dogma,<br/> it would be impossible for such recluse or brahmin<br/> to shake that monk in his belief,<br/> standing as he does on truth:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> it would be impossible to make him quake or waver;</p>

    <p class="f4">suppose from the west<br/> there comes a recluse or brahmin<br/> looking for dogma,<br/> searching for dogma,<br/> in hopes of refuting such dogma,<br/> it would be impossible for such recluse or brahmin<br/> to shake that monk in his belief,<br/> standing as he does on truth:<br/> it would be impossible to make him quake or waver;</p>

    <p class="f4">suppose from the north<br/> there comes a recluse or brahmin<br/> looking for dogma,<br/> searching for dogma,<br/> in hopes of refuting such dogma,<br/> it would be impossible for such recluse or brahmin<br/> to shake that monk in his belief,<br/> standing as he does on truth:<br/> it would be impossible to make him quake or waver;</p>

    <p class="f4">suppose from the south<br/> there comes a recluse or brahmin<br/> looking for dogma,<br/> searching for dogma,<br/> in hopes of refuting such dogma,<br/> it would be impossible for such recluse or brahmin<br/> to shake that monk in his belief,<br/> standing as he does on truth:<br/> it would be impossible to make him quake or waver.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, monks, a stone column<br/> sixteen cubits long,<br/> and eight cubits of it<br/> are sunk in the ground<br/> below the pedestal,<br/> while eight cubits<br/> are above the pedestal.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then from the east<br/> there comes a blast of wind and rain, -<br/> it could not shake it,<br/> could not make it quake or waver;</p>

    <p class="f4">or from the west<br/> there comes a blast of wind and rain, -<br/> it could not shake it,<br/> could not make it quake or waver;</p>

    <p class="f4">or from the north<br/> there comes a blast of wind and rain, -<br/> it could not shake it,<br/> could not make it quake or waver;</p>

    <p class="f4">or from the south<br/> there comes a blast of wind and rain, -<br/> it could not shake it,<br/> could not make it quake or waver.</p>

    <p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Because monks, the pedestal is deep set,<br/> the stone column,<br/> is deep dug.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br/> whatsoever monk understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understands,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">suppose from the east<br/> there comes a recluse or brahmin<br/> looking for dogma,<br/> searching for dogma,<br/> in hopes of refuting such dogma,<br/> it would be impossible for such recluse or brahmin<br/> to shake that monk in his belief,<br/> standing as he does on truth:<br/> it would be impossible to make him quake or waver;</p>

    <p class="f4">suppose from the west<br/> there comes a recluse or brahmin<br/> looking for dogma,<br/> searching for dogma,<br/> in hopes of refuting such dogma,<br/> it would be impossible for such recluse or brahmin<br/> to shake that monk in his belief,<br/> standing as he does on truth:<br/> it would be impossible to make him quake or waver;</p>

    <p class="f4">Why so?</p>

    <p class="f4">It is because he clearly sees four Ariyan truths.</p>

    <p class="f4">What four?</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
