    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha,<br/> on the hill Vulture's Peak.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, let us go to Splendid Spur<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> for the noonday rest."</p>

    <p class="f4">"So be it, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">So the Exalted One with a number of monks came to <span class="f2 g"><b>[379]</b></span> Splendid Spur.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now a certain monk saw the great precipice<br/> and on seeing it<br/> said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, this is indeed a great precipice!</p>

    <p class="f4">This is indeed a fearsome precipice, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there anywhere<br/> a precipice greater<br/> and more frightful?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, monk.</p>

    <p class="f4">There is indeed a precipice<br/> greater<br/> and more frightful.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the arising of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the ceasing of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">such delight in activities<br/> delight in activities that lead to rebirth,<br/> delight in activities that lead to old age,<br/> delight in activities that lead to death,<br/> delight in activities that lead to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus taking delight in activities<br/> delight in activities that lead to rebirth,<br/> delight in activities that lead to old age,<br/> delight in activities that lead to death,<br/> delight in activities that lead to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair,<br/> they compose a compound<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of activities that conduce to rebirth,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to old age,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to death,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus composing a compound of activities<br/> that conduce to rebirth,<br/> composing a compound of activities that lead to old age,<br/> composing a compound of activities that lead to death,<br/> composing a compound of activities that lead to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair,<br/> they fall down the precipice of rebirth,<br/> they fall down the precipice of old age,<br/> they fall down the precipice of death,<br/> they fall down the precipice of sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such are not released from rebirth,<br/> old age,<br/> death,<br/> sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are not released from Ill,<br/> I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, those recluses or brahmins who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the arising of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the ceasing of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">such take not delight in activities that conduce to rebirth,<br/> take not delight in activities that conduce to old age,<br/> take not delight in activities that conduce to death,<br/> take not delight in activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not taking delight in activities that conduce to rebirth,<br/> not taking delight in activities that conduce to old age,<br/> not taking delight in activities that conduce to death,<br/> not taking delight in activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair<br/> they compose not a compound of activities that conduce to rebirth<br/> they compose not a compound of activities that conduce to old age,<br/> they compose not a compound of activities that conduce to death,<br/> they compose not a compound of activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not composing a compound of activities that conduce to rebirth,<br/> not composing a compound of activities that conduce to old age,<br/> not composing a compound of activities that conduce to death,<br/> not composing a compound of activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair,<br/> they fall not down the precipice of rebirth,<br/> they fall not down the precipice of old age,<br/> they fall not down the precipice of death,<br/> they fall not down the precipice of sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are utterly released from rebirth,<br/> old age,<br/> death,<br/> sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are released from Ill,<br/> I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
