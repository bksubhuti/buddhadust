    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there is a Hell called<br/> 'The Great Distress.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Therein, whatsoever object one sees with the eye,<br/> one sees it as repulsive,<br/> not attractive:<br/> as repellent,<br/> not as charming:<br/> one sees it as unpleasant,<br/> not as pleasant.</p>

    <p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[380]</b></span> Whatsoever sound one hears with the ear,<br/> one hears it as repulsive,<br/> not attractive:<br/> as repellent,<br/> not as charming:<br/> one sees it as unpleasant,<br/> not as pleasant.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever taste one tastes with the tongue,<br/> one tastes it as repulsive,<br/> not attractive:<br/> as repellent,<br/> not as charming:<br/> one sees it as unpleasant,<br/> not as pleasant.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever smell one smells with the nose,<br/> one smells it as repulsive,<br/> not attractive:<br/> as repellent,<br/> not as charming:<br/> one sees it as unpleasant,<br/> not as pleasant.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever tangible one contacts with body,<br/> one contacts it as repulsive,<br/> not attractive:<br/> as repellent,<br/> not as charming:<br/> one sees it as unpleasant,<br/> not as pleasant.</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever mental states one is conscious of with mind,<br/> one is conscious of them as repulsive,<br/> not attractive:<br/> as repellent,<br/> not as charming:<br/> one sees them as unpleasant,<br/> not as pleasant."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, that is indeed a great distress!</p>

    <p class="f4">A great distress indeed, lord!</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any other distress<br/> greater or more fearsome?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"There is indeed, monks, a distress<br/> greater and more fearsome.</p>

    <p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the arising of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the ceasing of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">such delight in activities<br/> delight in activities that lead to rebirth,<br/> delight in activities that lead to old age,<br/> delight in activities that lead to death,<br/> delight in activities that lead to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus taking delight in activities<br/> delight in activities that lead to rebirth,<br/> delight in activities that lead to old age,<br/> delight in activities that lead to death,<br/> delight in activities that lead to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to rebirth,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to old age,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to death,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus composing a compound of activities<br/> that conduce to rebirth,<br/> composing a compound of activities that lead to old age,<br/> composing a compound of activities that lead to death,<br/> composing a compound of activities that lead to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair,<br/> they are scorched by the distress<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> of rebirth,<br/> they are scorched by the distress of old age,<br/> they are scorched by the distress of death,<br/> they are scorched by the distress of sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such are not released from rebirth,<br/> old age,<br/> death,<br/> sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are not released from Ill,<br/> I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, those recluses or brahmins who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the arising of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the ceasing of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">such take not delight in activities that conduce to rebirth,<br/> take not delight in activities that conduce to old age,<br/> take not delight in activities that conduce to death,<br/> take not delight in activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not taking delight in activities that conduce to rebirth,<br/> not taking delight in activities that conduce to old age,<br/> not taking delight in activities that conduce to death,<br/> not taking delight in activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair<br/> they compose not a compound of activities that conduce to rebirth<br/> they compose not a compound of activities that conduce to old age,<br/> they compose not a compound of activities that conduce to death,<br/> they compose not a compound of activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Not composing a compound of activities that conduce to rebirth,<br/> not composing a compound of activities that conduce to old age,<br/> not composing a compound of activities that conduce to death,<br/> not composing a compound of activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair,<br/> they are not scorched by the distress of rebirth,<br/> they are not scorched by the distress of old age,<br/> they are not scorched by the distress of death,<br/> they are not scorched by the distress of sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are utterly released from rebirth,<br/> old age,<br/> death,<br/> sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are released from Ill,<br/> I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>

    <p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward has abridged the entire second half of this sutta by reference to the previous sutta without indicating how he would manage the change. I have used the PED definition for <i>pariḍahati.</i> Here <i>Pariḷāha</i> would probably have better been translated using some term indicating 'burning' to more closely fit the parallel, as Bhk. Bodhi's "conflagration.".</p>
