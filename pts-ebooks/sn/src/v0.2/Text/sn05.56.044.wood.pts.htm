    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"If anyone, monks, should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Without fully comprehending<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of ceasing of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/> I will make an utter end of Ill,'<br/> it would be impossible for him to do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, monks, one should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Without building the lower part of a house,<br/> I will fix the upper part,'<br/> he could not do it.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, monks, if one should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Without fully comprehending<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of ceasing of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/> I will make an utter end of Ill,'<br/> it would be impossible for him to do so.</p>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <hr class="hrctr"/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">But if one should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'By fully comprehending,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of ceasing of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/> I will make an utter end of Ill,'<br/> it would be possible for him to do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Suppose, monks, someone should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'After building the lower part of a house<br/> I will fix the upper part,'<br/> he could do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Just so, if one should say:</p>

    <p class="f4">'By fully comprehending,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of ceasing of Ill,<br/> the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/> I will make an utter end of Ill,'<br/> it would be possible for him to do so.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
