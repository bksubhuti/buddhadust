    <hr/>

    <p>&#160;</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Vesālī<br/> in Great Grove,<br/> at the Hall of the Peaked Gable.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br/> robing himself in the forenoon<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe,<br/> went into Vesālī to beg.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda<br/> saw a number of Licchavi youths in the gymnasium,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> making practice at archery,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/> shooting even at a distance<br/> through a very small keyhole,<br/> and splitting an arrow,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/> shot after shot,<br/> without ever a miss.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now when the venerable Ānanda saw it he exclaimed to himself:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Practised shots are these Licchavi youths!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well practised shots indeed are these Licchavi youths,<br/> to be able to shoot like this even at a distance!"</p>

    <p class="f4">So when the venerable Ānanda<br/> had gone his rounds in Vesālī,<br/> had returned and eaten his meal,<br/> he went to see the Exalted One,<br/> and on coming to him<br/> saluted him<br/> and sat down at one side.</p>

    <p class="f4">So seated<br/> the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Here, lord, robing myself in the forenoon<br/> and taking bowl and outer robe<br/> I set out for Vesālī on my begging rounds.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then, lord, I saw a number of Licchavi youths<br/> in the gymnasium<br/> making practice at archery,<br/> shooting even from a distance<br/> through a very small keyhole,<br/> and splitting an arrow,<br/> shot after shot,<br/> with never a miss.</p>

    <p class="f4">And I said to myself, lord:</p>

    <p class="f4">'Practised shots are these Licchavi youths!</p>

    <p class="f4">Well practised shots indeed<br/> are these Licchavi youths,<br/> to be able even at a distance<br/> to splinter an arrow<br/> through a very small keyhole,<br/> shot after shot,<br/> with never a miss!'"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now what think you, Ānanda?</p>

    <p class="f4">Which is the harder,<br/> which is the harder task to compass:<br/> To shoot like that<br/> or <span class="f2 g"><b>[382]</b></span> to pierce one strand of a hair,<br/> a hundred times divided,<br/> with another strand?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, lord, of course<br/> to split a hair,<br/> a hundred times divided,<br/> with another strand is the harder,<br/> much the harder task."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just so, Ānanda,<br/> they who penetrate the meaning of:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill',<br/> 'This is the arising of Ill',<br/> 'This is the ceasing of Ill',<br/> 'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill',<br/> pierce through something much harder to pierce.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

Then standing at the distance of one <i>usabha</i> (? 140 cubits) he pierces, with the end tied on his arrow, that which is tied to the egg-plant.' <i>Cf.</i> Dhp<i>A.</i> i, 288.</p>
