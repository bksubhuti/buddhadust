    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks, there is a darkness of interstellar space,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/> impenetrable gloom,<br/> such a murk of darkness as cannot enjoy<br/> the splendour of this moon and sun,<br/> though they be of such mighty magic power and majesty."</p>

    <p class="f4">At these words<br/> a certain monk said to the Exalted One:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Lord, that must be a mighty darkness,<br/> a mighty darkness indeed!</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any other darkness<br/> greater and more fearsome than that?"|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">There is indeed, monk,<br/> another darkness,<br/> greater and more fearsome.</p>

    <p class="f4">Pray, lord, what is that other darkness<br/> greater and more fearsome than that?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/> understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the arising of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the ceasing of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">understand not,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">such delight in activities<br/> delight in activities that lead to rebirth,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> delight in activities that lead to old age,<br/> delight in activities that lead to death,<br/> delight in activities that lead to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus taking delight in activities<br/> delight in activities that lead to rebirth,<br/> delight in activities that lead to old age,<br/> delight in activities that lead to death,<br/> delight in activities that lead to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to rebirth,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to old age,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to death,<br/> they compose a compound of activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Thus composing a compound of activities<br/> that conduce to rebirth,<br/> composing a compound of activities that lead to old age,<br/> composing a compound of activities that lead to death,<br/> composing a compound of activities that lead to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair,<br/> they fall down into the darkness of rebirth,<br/> they fall down into the darkness of old age,<br/> they fall down into the darkness of death,<br/> they fall down into the darkness of sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">Such are not released from rebirth,<br/> old age,<br/> death,<br/> sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are not released from Ill,<br/> I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">But, monks, those recluses or brahmins who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the arising of Ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">who do understand,<br/> as it really is,<br/> the meaning of<br/> 'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

    <p class="f4">such take not delight in activities that conduce to rebirth,<br/> take not delight in activities that conduce to old age,<br/> take not delight in activities that conduce to death,<br/> take not delight in activities that conduce to sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are utterly released from rebirth,<br/> old age,<br/> death,<br/> sorrow,<br/> grief,<br/> woe,<br/> lamentation<br/> and despair.</p>

    <p class="f4">They are released from Ill,<br/> I declare.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
