    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, this mighty earth<br/> were one mass of water,<br/> and a man were to throw down thereon<br/> a yoke with one hole.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then comes a wind from the east<br/> and wafts it west,<br/> and a wind from the west<br/> wafts it east:<br/> a north wind wafts it south<br/> and a south wind wafts it north.</p>

    <p class="f4">Then once at the end of a hundred years<br/> a blind turtle pops up to the surface.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

    <p class="f4">Would that blind turtle<br/> push his neck through<br/> that yoke with one hole<br/> whenever he popped up to the surface<br/> at the end of a hundred years?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is unlikely,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> lord,<br/> that the blind turtle would do that."</p>

    <p class="f4">"It is just as unlikely, monks,<br/> that one will get birth in human form,<br/> just as unlikely<br/> that a Tathāgata should arise in the world,<br/> an Arahant,<br/> a fully Enlightened One;<br/> just as unlikely, monks,<br/> that the Norm and Discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata<br/> should be shown in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">But now indeed, monks,<br/> this state of human birth is won,<br/> and a Tathāgata has arisen in the world,<br/> and the Norm and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata<br/> is shown in the world.</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
