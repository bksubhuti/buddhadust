    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, Sineru, lord of mountains,<br/> should come to<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> extinction,<br/> should come to an end,<br/> all save seven grains of gravel as large as beans.</p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

    <p class="f4">Which is the more,<br/> that part of Sineru, lord of mountains,<br/> which has come to extinction,<br/> come to an end,<br/> or those seven grains of gravel<br/> as large as beans?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, lord, that part of Sineru, lord of mountains,<br/> is the more.</p>

    <p class="f4">Very small are seven grains of gravel as large as beans.</p>

    <p class="f4">They cannot be reckoned,<br/> they cannot be compared with it:<br/> they do not come to the merest fraction of a part<br/> when set beside all that part of Sineru<br/> which is extinguished,<br/> which has come to an end."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Just so, monks, for the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with vision,<br/> for a person of understanding,<br/> far greater is this Ill which he has destroyed,<br/> which he has used up,<br/> and infinitely small<br/> is that Ill which remains.</p>

    <p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br/> cannot be compared therewith.</p>

    <p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction of a part of it,<br/> when set beside that Ill<br/> which he has destroyed,<br/> which he has used up, -<br/> that is, it is just a period of seven lives at most,<br/> for the man who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is Ill'<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is the arising of Ill'<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
