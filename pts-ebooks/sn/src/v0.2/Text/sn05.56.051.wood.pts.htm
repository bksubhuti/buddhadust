    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/> taking up a little dust<br/> on the tip of his finger-nail,<br/> said to the monks:|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">"Now what think ye, monks?|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">Which is the greater,<br/> this little dust I have taken up<br/> on the tip of my finger-nail,<br/> or this mighty earth?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Greater, lord, is this mighty earth.</p>

    <p class="f4">Exceeding small<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/> is this little dust taken up<br/> on the tip of the Exalted One's fingernail:<br/> it cannot be reckoned,<br/> it cannot be compared therewith.</p>

    <p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction<br/> of a part of it<br/> when set beside the mighty earth,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> -<br/> this little dust taken up<br/> on the tip of the Exalted One's finger-nail."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, just so, monks,<br/> for the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with vision,<br/> for the person who has understanding,<br/> far greater is this Ill which he has destroyed,<br/> which he has used up,<br/> and infinitely small<br/> is that Ill which remains.</p>

    <p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br/> cannot be compared therewith.</p>

    <p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction<br/> of a part of it<br/> when set beside that Ill<br/> which he has destroyed,<br/> which he has used up, -<br/> that is, it is just a period of seven lives at most<br/> for the man who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is Ill'<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is the arising of Ill'<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
