    <p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

    <p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/> saying:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

    <p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

    <p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, that a man lays together<br/> on the mighty earth<br/> seven balls of clay<br/> as big as kola-stones.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

    <p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

    <p class="f4">Which is the greater:<br/> those balls of clay as big as kola-stones,<br/> thus laid together,<br/> or this mighty earth?"</p>

    <p class="f4">"Why, lord, this mighty earth is the greater.</p>

    <p class="f4">Exceeding small<br/> are the balls of clay<br/> as big as kola-stones:<br/> they cannot be reckoned,<br/> they cannot be compared therewith.|| ||</p>

    <p class="f4">They do not amount to the merest fraction<br/> of a part of this mighty earth, -<br/> those balls of clay<br/> as big as kola-stones."</p>

    <p class="f4">"Well, just so, monks,<br/> for the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with vision,<br/> for the person who has understanding,<br/> far greater is this Ill which he has destroyed,<br/> which he has used up,<br/> and infinitely small<br/> is that Ill which remains.</p>

    <p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br/> cannot be compared therewith.</p>

    <p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction<br/> of a part of it<br/> when set beside that Ill<br/> which he has destroyed,<br/> which he has used up, -<br/> that is, it is just a period of seven lives at most<br/> for the man who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is Ill'<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is the arising of Ill'<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br/> who understands,<br/> as it really is:<br/> the meaning of:<br/> 'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

    <p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
