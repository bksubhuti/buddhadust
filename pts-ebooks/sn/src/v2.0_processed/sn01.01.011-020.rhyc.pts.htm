We have no list of the 33; there were hosts of retinue-devas. According to tradition, devas were sent to the park by Sakka, when their decease was imminent, there to dissolve like snow, or like a windblown lamp-flame, and be reborn.</p>

Meaning 'bases, or substrate of rebirth,' it refers  to such dispositions in character and conduct as form those bases, in other words, the common life of sense and desire. Thus the <i>Comy.</i> paraphrases it here by <i>pañcakāmaguṇā</i> (<i>cf.</i> §I: "sensuous enjoyment"), but in IV, 1, §6, by the five <i>khandhas</i> (mind and body). The term became also applied to the <i>kilesa's</i> and the <i>kāma's</i> (<i>cf.</i> Childers' Dicty. s.v. <i>upadhi</i>). The verses recur in IV, 1, §8, where an alternative rendering is given.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> The Master, writes B., seeing his false (or, rather, his one-sided) view, breaks into his speech with an opposite conclusion, as one may bring down a fruit by throwing another fruit at it.</p>

'Who knows the reason why,' says B., whether he be horse, elephant, or steer. Such was King Kūṭakaṇṇa's horse, who, when drawing the royal chariot to the Hill of Shrines, would not cross the Kalamba river (see Geiger's <i>Mahāvaṇsa</i> Translation, Map of Anurādhapura: Cetiyapabbata, Kalamba-nadī). The driver assured the annoyed monarch that the beast was not mutinous, but so well trained that he feared lest, by wetting his tail, he might spurt water over his master. 'Lift up his tail, Sire!' The King complied, and the horse entered the ford. (This king reigned over Ceylon A.D. 16-38.)</p>

The story is the same, the diction a little different. The <i>devatā</i> of the Nikāya is shown in the Jātaka to be a deva-dhītā or 'goddess,' and the Burmese MSS. so allude to  her: — <i>'anuppattā,' 'yakkhī.</i>' The Singhalese MSS. ignore the Jātaka, and write <i>anuppatto</i> and <i>yakkha</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a></sup> The little riddle turns on the ambiguity of <i>bhutvā,</i> having eaten,' 'having enjoyed thyself in general,' — in other words 'sown your wild oats.' The significance of the 'hour,' or 'moment' recalls the <i>'Psalms'</i> (I, p. 12 <i>f.;</i> II, vers. 231, 403, 653, 1005), albeit neither commentator on this story brings out that point. The hour that is hidden is that of Samiddhi's death. <i>Cf.</i> below, IV, 3, § 1. Hence we have three points of time: — season of youth, opportunity for the Nibbāna-aspirant, death. <i>Cf.</i> the riddle of the flag, <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> LXIV.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a></sup> <i>Kālika,</i> lit. 'time-ish' (cf. the Greek <i>chrōñ-ios</i>). Of the negative form — <i>akālika,</i> often used in describing the Dhamma — B. says 'the Dhamma of the Ariyan Path gives its fruit (fruition-bliss) immediately after process' (or procedure to attain). In other words, the Path-graduate has his heavens at hand, not as postmortem events. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Pss of the Brethren,</i> 314, <i>n.</i>1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a></sup> B. names alternative terms for noviciate, medium rank and theraship, vis.: to 5, 10 years, and after, or to 10, 20 years, and after.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a></sup> The verses occur <i>Iti-vuttaka,</i> § 63. The last two lines are quite different:—</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The Buddha rebukes the fairy for her suggestive ambiguities.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The burden of the verses is doctrinally and philosophically of high importance, and the bewilderment of the frivolous fairy, abruptly confronted with them, is ironically pathetic. 'Told by names,' lit., 'what may be expressed' (<i>akkheyyāni,</i> from <i>ā-khā,</i> to pro-claim); <i>cf.</i> <i>D.</i> i, 4; <i>Dhammapada,</i> 275; <i>A.</i> ii, 17, etc. Mankind, says B., have many notions (<i>saññino</i> — are 'ware of) about the many compounds of the five aggregates (<i>i.e.,</i> of mind and matter), expressed in names, <i>e.g.</i> god, man, layman, recluse, person, individual, Tissa, Phussa, etc. He who understands sees in these compounds as such no realities, nor a permanent entity in the declarer of them. The only realities are the several components (the five khandhas), and these, though real, are ever changing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a></sup> These are the three forms of false opinion and strife springing from <i>māna.</i> See above I, 1, § 9; <i>S</i>. iii, 48; <i>Bud. Psy. Eth.,</i> p. 298 <i>f.</i> Expanded also to nine: <i>Vibhanga,</i> 389 <i>f.</i> Comparisons invalid in the ever-changing collocations that make up individuals.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a></sup> <i>Sankhā.</i> The arahant has put away such notions as 'lusting,' 'being angry,' 'confused.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> reads <i>na ca mānam ajjhagā,</i> and it is very likely, since this agrees with the context, that Feer read <i>vi-</i> erroneously if he consulted here only Singhalese MSS. Nevertheless B. allows the alternative sense, in <i>mānan</i> of an abode, <i>i.e.,</i> in rebirth, a matrix, <i>as if</i> he had a <i>v.l. = vimānaṇ</i> before him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Sutta-Nipāta</i> 219.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a></sup> The fairy has rightly discerned, says B., the Middle Path between self-indulgence and self-torture. In fact she gives the whole Eightfuld Path: — 'in speech, or body': Angas 305; 'mindful': Angas 6-8; 'understanding': Angas 1,2. 'It was in fact the occasion of a mighty teaching.'</p>
