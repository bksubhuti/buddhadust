					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> In <i>Pss. of the Brethren </i>(vers. 39, 40, 1162, 1163) these verses are put in the mouth of Tissa (the Buddha's stepbrother), Vaḍḍhamāna and Vangīsa. In that work for 'fallacy of soul' we read 'lust of living' (<i>bhavarāga, not sakkāyadiṭṭhi</i>). B. ignores this, and makes the Master judge that the deva had poorly grasped the force of the metaphor. This is, that escape is only effectual when the real stumbling-block is surmounted — the soul-fallacy. This happens when the First Path is entered, the only right way of escape. 'Go forth,' <i>i.e.,</i> 'leave the world.' The verses recur below, II, 2, § 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The little enigma bears on the double meaning of touch; active and passive — to make to feel, and to feel — the act <i>(kamma)</i> and its result-in-sentience (vipāka). On the latter, <i>cf. Pss. of the Brethren,</i> ver, 783 — <i>phassa-phuṭṭha;</i> 'touched by the touch, rendered 'all feel the touch.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> These lines recur VII, 1, §4, and occur <i>S.N.</i> 662, <i>Dhp.</i> 125. B. does not explicitly place them here in the mouth of the Teacher. The case of the innocent seems to be given <i>a fortiori,</i> to wit, from the more general statement.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Desire or craving is likened to the interwoven foliage of ferns or bamboos, 'within, without' being referred to self and others, organs and objects of sense. <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Developing concentration and insight. <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> The <i>Āsavas:</i> — sensuality, lust for renewed life, delusions, nescience. The figure means a poisonous flux or ooze.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> B. explains this line as (1) <i>kāmabhava,</i> 'life in the worlds of desire' — i.e., from purgatory to the five lowest deva-worlds; and (2) <i>rūpabhava,</i> 'life in the higher (not highest) heavens.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> reads <i>mano-yatattan.</i> Both this and the following <i>pada</i> fail in scansion. The SS. MSS. omit <i>ca,</i> and the <i>Comy.</i> substitutes <i>uppannan.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> The Teacher is made to think: 'I will better this deva's misguided talk by distinguishing (<i>vibhajetvā, cf.</i> the name for his School: — <i>Vibhajjavādin</i>) where mind should be (1) checked, (2) developed, fostered, made to grow.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a></sup> This, says B., was a forest fairy, who had listened to the talk of the forest-dwelling brethren and heard them say like any worldling: 'I' am eating ... sitting ... 'my' bowl, 'my' robe ..., when they hold that not 'I,' but a compound of <i>khandhas</i> is in activity. 'Have they then,' is the further question, no <i>māna</i> at all? See above, I, 1, §9. This is reckoned as the eighth to go, of the Ten Fetters, before Arahantship is won. On conventional usage and philosophic meaning, see above, I, 2, § 10; also <i>Points of Controversy,</i> p. 68, n.2.</p>

B.'s comments here are brief. The streams = <i>saṇsāra,</i> the endlessly reborn life-flux of beings. The whirlpool <i>(vaṭṭa)</i> = the same (<i>cf.</i> <i>S.</i> iii, 63 <i>f.;</i> iv, 180: <i>āvaṭṭa</i> = the pleasures of the five senses). The four elements, in Buddhist doctrine, mean, not simply 'water, earth, fire, air,' but the elemental forces of which these are concrete manifestations: the cohesive, extending, calorific, mobile elements in matter. This appears in the Nikāyas, if unformulated till later — <i>e.g.</i> in <i>M.</i> i, No.62, the Buddha speaks of the internal 'earth' in each of us — <i>i.e.,</i> the stretched-out surface in the phenomenon of body.</p>
