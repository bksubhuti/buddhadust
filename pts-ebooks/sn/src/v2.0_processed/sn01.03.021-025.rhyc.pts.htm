					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> pictures this interview as a public one. Among the large audience are rival teachers, self-consciously 'scratching the ground with their feet.' They had suffered in popularity through Gotama's rising fame, and had represented him as exhorting the people	to give to him and his followers only. The king summons the meeting to let him vindicate himself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a></sup> The <i>Comy.</i> relates, as the legend of this sutta, that bandits had laid an ambush for the king in the Andha Wood as he went, sometimes with but a small escort, to pay his respects to the Teacher. He was warned in time, and had the wood surrounded, capturing and impaling or crucifying the bandits on either side of the way leading through the wood. The Teacher judged that if the king, who came on red-handed to him, were taxed with the horrid deed, he would become sullen and not countermand anything. Hence the method adopted in this impressive dialogue.<br/>
					It does not fit well, however, and the king would scarcely be referring to the gens d'arme work he had been doing in the wood by such expressions as 'battle* (<i>hatihi-yuddhāni,</i> etc.) and the rest. Nor does the <i>Comy.</i> tell of any repentant action at the end.</p>
