					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha,<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove,<br/>
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Asurinda Bhāradvaja<br/>
					heard that the Bhāradvaja had<br/>
					'left the world to enter the Order of Gotama the Recluse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Vexed and displeased,<br/>
					he sought the presence of the Exalted One,<br/>
					and there reviled and abused the Exalted One<br/>
					with rude and harsh words.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken,<br/>
					the Exalted One remained silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Asurinda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thou art conquered, recluse,<br/>
					thou art conquered!"</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The fool forsooth doth deem the victory his<br/>
							In that he plays the bully with rude speech.<br/>
							To him who knoweth how he may forbear,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
							This in itself doth make him conqueror.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Worse of the two is he who, when reviled,<br/>
							Reviles again. Who doth not, when reviled,<br/>
							Revile again, a two-fold victory wins.<br/>
							Both of the other and himself he seeks<br/>
							The good; for he the other's angry mood<br/>
							Doth understand and groweth calm and still.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">He who of both is a physician, since<br/>
							Himself he healeth and the other too,—<br/>
							Folk deem him fool, they knowing not the Norm."</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had so said,<br/>
					Asurinda of the Bhāradvājas spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord,<br/>
					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/>
					that which had been thrown down,<br/>
					or were to reveal<br/>
					that which was hidden away,<br/>
					or were to point out the right road<br/>
					to him who had gone astray,<br/>
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br/>
					so that those who had eyes<br/>
					could see external objects<br/>
					— even so, lord, has the lord Gotama<br/>
					shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I even I, lord,<br/>
					betake myself to the Exalted One<br/>
					as my refuge,<br/>
					to the Norm<br/>
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would leave the world<br/>
					under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br/>
					I would take orders."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin left the world<br/>
					under the Exalted One,<br/>
					and was ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br/>
					the venerable Bhāradvāja, remaining alone and separate,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					ardent and strenuous,<br/>
					attained to that supreme goal<br/>
					of the higher life,<br/>
					for the sake of which<br/>
					the clansmen rightly go forth from home<br/>
					into the homeless;<br/>
					yea, that supreme goal did he<br/>
					by himself,<br/>
					even in this present life,<br/>
					come to understand and realize.</p>

					<p class="f4">He came to understand<br/>
					that rebirth was destroyed,<br/>
					that the holy life was being lived,<br/>
					that his task was done,<br/>
					that for life as we conceive it<br/>
					there was no hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja<br/>
					became one of the Arahants.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> 'Lord of Asura(demon)s.' This was the youngest of the brothers Bhāradvaja. <i>Comy.</i> In the Sutta he is called by the adjectival form: <i>Asurindaka,</i> 'demon-chiefer.' The name is so 'pagan' for a brahmin, and the Buddha's reply so suggestive of Sakka's (XI, 1, § 4), that a bifurcated or transferred legend here seems fairly plausible. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Dialogues,</i> ii, 73, also 297.</p>
