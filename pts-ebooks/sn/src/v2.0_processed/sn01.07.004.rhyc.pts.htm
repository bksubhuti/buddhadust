					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> <span class="f2"><b>HAVE</b></span> I H<span class="f2"><b>EARD:</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha,<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove,<br/>
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Bhāradvaja brahmin<br/>
					[known as] the Congey-man<br/>
					heard that the Bhāradvaja had<br/>
					"left the world to enter the Order of Gotama the Recluse."</p>

					<p class="f4">Vexed and displeased,<br/>
					he sought the presence of the Exalted One,<br/>
					and when there<br/>
					sat at one side in silence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, discerning by his mind<br/>
					the thoughts of that man's mind,<br/>
					addressed him in verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Whoso doth wrong the man that's innocent: —<br/>
							Him that is pure and from all errors free —<br/>
							His wicked act returns upon that fool<br/>
							Like fine dust that is thrown against the wind."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, the Congey-man said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/>
					that which had been thrown down,<br/>
					or were to reveal<br/>
					that which was hidden away,<br/>
					or were to point out the right road<br/>
					to him who had gone astray,<br/>
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br/>
					so that those who had eyes could see external objects<br/>
					— even so, lord, has the lord Gotama<br/>
					shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I even I, lord, betake myself<br/>
					to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br/>
					to the Norm<br/>
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would leave the world under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br/>
					I would take orders."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin left the world under the Exalted One,<br/>
					and was ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br/>
					the venerable Bhāradvāja,<br/>
					remaining alone and separate,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					ardent and strenuous,<br/>
					attained [ere long] to that supreme goal of the higher life,<br/>
					for the sake of which the clansmen<br/>
					rightly go forth from home into the homeless;<br/>
					yea, that supreme goal did he by himself,<br/>
					even in this present life,<br/>
					come to understand and realize.</p>

					<p class="f4">He came to understand<br/>
					that rebirth was destroyed,<br/>
					that the holy life was being lived,<br/>
					that his task was done,<br/>
					that for life as we conceive it<br/>
					there was no hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the Arahants.</p>

He had won large profits, says B., by running a shop for different kinds of excellently prepared 'congey ' (<i>kañjikā</i>). The soubriquet of <i>Bilang-ika</i> (<i>bilanga</i> being another name for such preparations on a basis of rice-broth) was given him by the Recensionists at the Third Council (<i>Patna</i>).</p>
