					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><b>THUS</b></span> <span class="f2"><b>HAVE</b></span> I H<span class="f2"><b>EARD:</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					the Bhāradvāja [known as] 'Puritan'<br/>
					came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and exchanging with him<br/>
					the greetings and compliments of amity and courtesy,<br/>
					took his seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he addressed the Exalted One in a verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Though he be virtuous and penance work<br/>
							There is in all the world no brahmin found,<br/>
							Thus rendered pure.</p>

      					<p class="f4 in2">'T is by the Veda-lore and by the course<br/>
							His class lays down<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> that he is purified,<br/>
							Unique 'mong men."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span> [The Exalted One: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Nay, though he jabber multitudes of runes,<br/>
							Thus is no brahmin made regenerate,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
							Garbage-defiled within, propped by deceits.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">But be he noble, brahmin, commoner,<br/>
							Or labouring man, or of a pariah class,<br/>
							Who stirs up effort, puts forth all his strength,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
							Advances with an ever vigorous stride,<br/>
							He may attain the Purity Supreme.<br/>
							Brahmin, know this!"</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Puritan said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/>
					that which had been thrown down,<br/>
					or were to reveal<br/>
					that which was hidden away,<br/>
					or were to point out the right road<br/>
					to him who had gone astray,<br/>
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br/>
					so that those who had eyes could see external objects<br/>
					— even so, lord, has the lord Gotama<br/>
					shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I even I, lord, betake myself<br/>
					to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br/>
					to the Norm<br/>
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would leave the world<br/>
					under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br/>
					I would take orders."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin left the world under the Exalted One,<br/>
					and was ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br/>
					the venerable Bhāradvāja,<br/>
					remaining alone and separate,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					ardent and strenuous,<br/>
					attained [ere long] to that supreme goal of the higher life,<br/>
					for the sake of which the clansmen rightly go forth from home into the homeless;<br/>
					yea, that supreme goal did he by himself,<br/>
					even in this present life,<br/>
					come to understand and realize.</p>

					<p class="f4">He came to understand that<br/>
					rebirth was destroyed,<br/>
					that the holy life was being lived,<br/>
					that his task was done,<br/>
					that for life as we conceive it<br/>
					there was no hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the Arahants.</p>
