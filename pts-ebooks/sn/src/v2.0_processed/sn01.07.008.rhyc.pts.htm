					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha,<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove,<br/>
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					a preparation of rice with ghee had been concocted<br/>
					for the Bhāradvaja brahmin [known as] the Fire-man,<br/>
					for he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will offer the fire-sacrifice,<br/>
					I will tend the fire-oblation."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One<br/>
					having dressed early,<br/>
					and taken bowl and robe,<br/>
					went and entered Rājagaha for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, going for alms from place to place,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					he drew near to the dwelling of the Fire-man Bhāradvaja,<br/>
					and approaching<br/>
					stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahmin beheld him coming for alms,<br/>
					and seeing him,<br/>
					addressed the Exalted One in a verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Proficient in the Vedas Three, a man<br/>
							Pure born and learned,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> and acquainted well<br/>
							With all the lore and ritual [of our class]: —<br/>
							His let it be to enjoy this goodly rice!"</p>

					<p class="f4"> <span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span> [The Exalted One: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Nay,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> though he jabber multitudes of runes,<br/>
							Thus is no brahmin made regenerate,<br/>
							Garbage-defiled within, cloaked by deceits.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whose vision many former lives hath pierced,<br/>
							Who sees the heavens above, the depths below,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
							His is 't to win the doing down of birth: —<br/>
							Master of supernormal lore,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> a Seer.<br/>
							In these Three Vedas if a brahmin be<br/>
							One whom we call 'learned in the Triple Lore,'<br/>
							Of him shouldst thou declare: — 'acquainted well<br/>
							With all the lore and ritual [of ourselves]—<br/>
							'His let it be to enjoy this goodly rice.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">[The brahmin:—]</p>

					<p class="f4">"May it please the worshipful Master Gotama to eat!<br/>
					His worship is a brahmin."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Not<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> mine to enjoy [presents] for chanting verses.<br/>
							Not normal this, brahmin, for minds discerning.<br/>
							Buddhas reject wages for chanting verses.<br/>
							True to the Norm, this is their mode of conduct.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[209]</b></span> On other grounds minister thou, 0 brahmin,<br/>
							With food and drink to a great Seer made perfect,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
							To one from whom purged are the mental Poisons,<br/>

							Yea, here's the field, if for reward<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> thou lookest."</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Fireman, the Bharadvaja, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/>
					that which had been thrown down,<br/>
					or were to reveal<br/>
					that which was hidden away,<br/>
					or were to point out the right road<br/>
					to him who had gone astray,<br/>
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br/>
					so that those who had eyes could see external objects<br/>
					— even so, lord, has the lord Gotama<br/>
					shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I even I, lord, betake myself<br/>
					to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br/>
					to the Norm<br/>
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would leave the world under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br/>
					I would take orders."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin<br/>
					left the world under the Exalted One,<br/>
					and was ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br/>
					the venerable Bhāradvāja,<br/>
					remaining alone and separate,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					ardent and strenuous,<br/>
					attained [ere long] to that supreme goal of the higher life,<br/>
					for the sake of which the clansmen rightly go forth from home into the homeless;<br/>
					yea, that supreme goal did he by himself,<br/>
					even in this present life,<br/>
					come to understand and realize.</p>

					<p class="f4">He came to understand<br/>
					that rebirth was destroyed,<br/>
					that the holy life was being lived,<br/>
					that his task was done,<br/>
					that for life as we conceive it there was no hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the Arahants.</p>
