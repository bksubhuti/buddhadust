					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying among the Kosalese<br/>
					in a certain forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Bhāradvāja brahmin 'New-Works'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					was having [timber]-work done in that forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he saw the Exalted One<br/>
					seated beneath a sala-tree cross-legged,<br/>
					his body in an upright posture<br/>
					and mindfulness set up before his face.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing him, the thought occurred:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am enjoying the work<br/>
					that I am having done in this forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">That Samana Gotama,<br/>
					what is he enjoying in the doing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So New-Works drew nigh to the Exalted One<br/>
					and addressed him in the verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"What enterprise of thine is being wrought,<br/>
							0 almsman, in the wood where sal-trees grow,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span>
							That lonely in the forest though thou be,<br/>
							Enjoyment still is thine, 0 Gotama?"</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"No work in wood is left for me to do.<br/>
							Root-cut for me is wood and jungle all,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[228]</b></span> Thus I, all free from briars in the wood,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
							And with my heart unpierced,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> alone may find<br/>
							My joy, for whom regrets have ceased to be."</p>

					<p class="f4">When these words had been said,<br/>
					New-Works, the Bhāradvāja brahmin, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">As if one raised up<br/>
					that which had been overthrown,<br/>
					or revealed<br/>
					that which had been hidden,<br/>
					or declared the way<br/>
					to one who was bewildered,<br/>
					or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br/>
					so that they that had eyes could see,<br/>
					even so is the Norm in many ways<br/>
					made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br/>
					to the Norm,<br/>
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br/>
					who from this day forth<br/>
					as long as life endures<br/>
					has taken in him refuge!"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Nava-kammika.</i> On this expression B. confirms the interpretation given in the <i>Vin. Texts,</i> ii, 359, n. 2; <i>cf.</i> iii, 189. This brahmin had forest-trees cut and the timber framework 'for gables, roof-terraces, etc., fitted, then carried to the town and sold,' presumably for the <i>vaḍḍhaki,</i> or worker in wood, to carry on withal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> VII, 1, § 10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> V, § 5, <i>n.</i> 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> B. does not help us over the word <i>visūkaṃ (sic lege)</i> or <i>visukkhaṃ</i>. Here it can hardly mean 'puppet-show' as in <i>D.</i> i, 6 (<i>cf.</i> <i>Dialogues,</i> i, 7, <i>n.</i> 2). The Sanskrit equivalent (<i>viṣvaṇk</i>) means etymologically spreading in all directions; hence <i>visūkaṃ</i> may be either (a) jungle or thicket, in apposition to <i>vanaṃ,</i> or (b) an adverb to 'cut': cut on all sides.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <i>Vane nibbanatho</i> (for <i>nir-vanatho</i>) is again metaphorical, wood standing for lusts or passions (<i>kilesa-vana, Comy.</i>) <i>Cf.</i> <i>Pss. of the Sisters,</i> LXII.</p>

						

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> Another favourite religious metaphor (<i>op. cit.</i> ver. 52 and <i>Brethren:</i> index <i>s.v.</i> 'Dart.'). Is there not here another pun: <i>A-sallo = a-sālo?</i> (As if we were to say: 'and with my back un-birched.')</p>
