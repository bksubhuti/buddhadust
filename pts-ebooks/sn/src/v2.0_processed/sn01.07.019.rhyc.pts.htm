					<p class="f4">On one occasion at Sāvatthi<br/>
					a brahmin who supported his mother<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					came to see the Exalted One, and,<br/>
					exchanging with him the greetings and compliments of courtesy,<br/>
					took his seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of a truth, Master Gotama,<br/>
					I seek my alms after the normal manner,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and so seeking them I maintain my parents.</p>

					<p class="f4">Am I not, sir, in so doing,<br/>
					doing what ought to be done?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yea, verily thou, brahmin,<br/>
					in so doing<br/>
					doest what ought to be done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, brahmin, seeks alms after the normal manner,<br/>
					and so seeking maintains his parents,<br/>
					engenders much merit.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">In normal fashion whoso doth maintain<br/>
							His mother or his father, in this life<br/>
							Him for that cherishing the wise commend,<br/>
							And after death he wins the joys of heaven."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been spoken<br/>
					the mother-maintaining
					brahmin said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Most excellent, Master Gotama,<br/>
					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">As if one raised up<br/>
					that which had been overthrown,<br/>
					or revealed<br/>
					that which had been hidden,<br/>
					or declared the way<br/>
					to one who was bewildered,<br/>
					or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br/>
					so that they that had eyes could see,<br/>
					even so is the Norm in many ways<br/>
					made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br/>
					to the Norm,<br/>
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br/>
					who from this day forth<br/>
					as long as life endures<br/>
					has taken in him refuge!"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> It was permissible, by the laws compiled in 'Manu,' for a brahmin to live by food given unasked or got by begging (IV, 4, 5), especially in times of scarcity (X, 120). Hence neither this brahmin, nor the mendicant (§ 10), was necessarily a recluse.</p>
