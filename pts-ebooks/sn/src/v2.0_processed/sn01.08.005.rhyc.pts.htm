					<p class="f4">On one occasion, when he was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at the Jeta Vana,<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yea, lord," they said responsive.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Possessed of four qualities, Bhikkhus,<br/>
					is the speech that is well<br/>
					and not ill spoken,<br/>
					faultless<br/>
					and not blamable by the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[240]</b></span> Of what four qualities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Bhikkhus, if a brother speak well<br/>
					and not badly,<br/>
					speak righteously<br/>
					and not unrighteously,<br/>
					speak affectionately<br/>
					and not unkindly,<br/>
					speak truth<br/>
					and not falsehood,<br/>
					his speech having these four qualities,<br/>
					is well spoken,<br/>
					faultless,<br/>
					and not blamable by the wise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br/>
					and the Blessed One saying this,<br/>
					the Master spake thus further: —</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"The good say: first let speech be nicely said,<br/>
							And second, speak by good norm, not by bad,<br/>
							Next, ye should kindly, not unkindly speak,<br/>
							And fourthly, say ye what is true, not false."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṇgīsa,<br/>
					rising from his seat,<br/>
					and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/>
					stretched forth his hands<br/>
					saluting, to the Exalted One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is revealed to me, Exalted One,<br/>
					it is revealed to me, Blessed One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be it revealed to thee, Vaṇgīsa!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṇgīsa extolled the Exalted One in his presence<br/>
					in suitable verses: —</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"Whoso can speak a word whereby he works<br/>
							No torment to himself, nor causeth harm<br/>
							To fellow-men, that word is spoken well.<br/>
							Whoso can speak a kindly word, a word<br/>
							That's grateful to the ear, and lays not hold<br/>
							Of other's faults, that word is kindly spoke.<br/>
							Truth is ambrosial speech<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span>; of saints of old<br/>
							This was the ancient Norm<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>; on Truth and good<br/>
							And Norm, 't is said, the saints do firmly stand.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The Word which the Awakened speaketh, sure<br/>
							Safe guide to make Nibbāna ours, to put<br/>
							An end to Ill: — that is the Word Supreme."</p>
