					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at the Jeta Vana,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta was instructing,<br/>
					enlightening,<br/>
					inciting,<br/>
					and inspiring the brethren by a sermon,<br/>
					delivered in courteous speech,<br/>
					without impediment,<br/>
					clearly enunciated,<br/>
					communicating the matter in hand.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those brethren with their whole mind applied,<br/>
					attentive and intent,<br/>
					listened with rapt hearing to the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṇgīsa thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The venerable Sāriputta and the brethren are thus engaged.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to extol the venerable Sāriputta in his presence with suitable verses?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So he rose from his seat,<br/>
					and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/>
					he bent his clasped hands saluting toward the venerable Sāriputta, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is revealed to me, brother Sāriputta!<br/>
					it is revealed to me!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be it revealed to thee, brother Vanglsa."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vanglsa extolled him to his face<br/>
					in suitable verses: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"With insight [into mysteries] deep,<br/>
							And richly dowered with learned lore,<br/>
							Expert in methods true and false,<br/>
							The son of Sari,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> greatly wise,<br/>
							Teacheth the brethren in the Norm.<br/>
							He teacheth both in brief outline,<br/>
							And eke expounds in full detail.<br/>
							And like the myna-bird's<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> sweet song<br/>
							His exposition poureth forth.<br/>
							And while he teaches, they who hear<br/>
							His honeyed speech in tones they love<br/>
							Of voice enchanting, musical,<br/>
							With ravished ears, transported hearts<br/>
							Delighted, list his every word."</p>
