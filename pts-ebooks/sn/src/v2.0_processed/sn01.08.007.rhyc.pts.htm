					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					in the East Park,<br/>
					at the Terraced House of Migāra's Mother.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And with him was a great company of bhikkhus,<br/>
					even five hundred,<br/>
					all of them Arahants.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One,<br/>
					[presiding] on the fortnightly festival day<br/>
					at the Pavāraṇā ceremony,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					was seated in the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">And surveying the silent company of brethren,<br/>
					he addressed them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, bhikkhus, I invite you:<br/>
					have ye not aught wherein you blame me,<br/>
					in deed or word?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus said, the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					rising from his seat,<br/>
					and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/>
					bent his clasped hands saluting toward the Exalted One<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, lord, we blame the Exalted One<br/>
					in naught<br/>
					either in deed or in word.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the Exalted One doth cause a Way to arise<br/>
					where none had arisen,<br/>
					doth produce a Way<br/>
					that had not been brought about,<br/>
					doth declare a Way<br/>
					that had not been declared;<br/>
					he knoweth a Way,<br/>
					understandeth a Way,<br/>
					is expert in a Way,<br/>
					and now, lord,<br/>
					thy disciples following after thee,<br/>
					have made that Way their own.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I too, lord, invite the Exalted One:<br/>
					is there not aught wherefore he blames me,<br/>
					in deed or in word?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, Sāriputta,<br/>
					naught is there for which I blame thee,<br/>
					in deed or in word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wise art thou, Sāriputta,<br/>
					comprehensive and manifold is thy wisdom,<br/>
					joyous and swift is thy wisdom,<br/>
					sharp and fastidious is thy wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as the eldest son<br/>
					of a king whose is the Wheel of Conquest<br/>
					rightly turns the Wheel<br/>
					as his father hath turned it,<br/>
					so, Sāriputta,<br/>
					dost thou rightly turn the Wheel Supreme of the Norm,<br/>
					even as I have turned it."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[243]</b></span> "If indeed, lord, the Exalted One have naught wherefore he blameth me,<br/>
					in deed or word,<br/>
					is there naught in these five hundred brethren wherefore the Exalted One blames them,<br/>
					in deed or word?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"There is naught, Sāriputta,<br/>
					for which I blame these five hundred, brethren,<br/>
					in deed or word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these brethren,<br/>
					sixty have threefold lore,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					sixty have sixfold supernormal knowledge,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					sixty are emancipated in both ways,<br/>
					and the others are emancipated by insight [alone]."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṇgīsa,<br/>
					arising from his seat,<br/>
					and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/>
					bent his clasped hands saluting toward the Exalted One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is revealed to me, Exalted One!<br/>
					it is revealed to me, Blessed One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be it revealed to thee, Vaṇgīsa."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṇgīsa extolled the Exalted One in his presence with suitable verses: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"To-day on feast-day, for full purity,<br/>
							Five hundied brethren are together come.<br/>
							Such as have cut their fetters, cut their bondsr<br/>
							Seers who are free from rebirth and from ill.<br/>
							And as a king who ruleth all the world,<br/>
							Surrounded by his councillors of state,<br/>
							Toureth around his empire everywhere,<br/>
							Driving throughout this earth that ends in sea,<br/>
							So him, who is our victor in the war,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>
							The peerless Master of our caravan,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
							We followers attend and wait upon,<br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[244]</b></span> Who hold the triple lore, slayers of death.<br/>
							All we are sons of the Exalted One;<br/>
							No sterile chaff<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> may amongst us be found.<br/>
							I worship him who strikes down craving's dart.<br/>
							I greet the offspring of the sun's great line."</p>
