					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha,<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove,<br/>
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Aññāsi-Koṇḍañña,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					after a very long interval,<br/>
					came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and coming,<br/>
					fell with face to earth<br/>
					at the feet of the Exalted One,<br/>
					and kissed and stroked them with his hands,<br/>
					uttering his name:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am Koṇḍañña, Exalted One!<br/>
					I am Koṇḍañña, Blessed One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṇgīsa,<br/>
					arising from his seat,<br/>
					and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/>
					bent his clasped hands saluting toward the Exalted One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is revealed to me, Exalted One!<br/>
					it is revealed to me, Blessed One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be it revealed to thee, Vaṇgīsa."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaṇgīsa extolled the Aññāsi-Koṇḍañña, before the Exalted One in appropriate verses: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Who next to our great Waked One was awoke,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
							Brother Koṇḍañña, strong in energy,<br/>
							The winner of a life of blissful ease,<br/>
							Ever detached from every worldly tie.<br/>
							All that the Master's follower can win,<br/>
							If he the training in the Rule fulfil,<br/>
							All this Koṇḍañña, step by step hath won.<br/>
							By study strenuous [of mind and will].<br/>
							Sublime in power and versed in triple lore,<br/>
							Expert the thoughts of others to descry,<br/>
							Koṇḍañña, of the Buddha rightful heir,<br/>
							Low at the Master's feet behold him lie."</p>
