					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at the Jeta Vana,<br/>
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Vaṇgīsa had but a little while ago won Arahantship,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					and experiencing the bliss of emancipation,<br/>

							From town and village on to town again.<br/>
							Then we beheld the All-Enlightened <i>[him<br/>
							Who hath transcended all that we can know]</i>.<br/>
							He in the Norm instructed me <i>[the Seer<br/>
							Who hath transcended all the power of ill.<br/>
							And when we heard that Norm our heart was glad],</i><br/>
							And faith and trust therein rose up in us.<br/>
							Hearing that Norm concerning body, mind,<br/>
							Sensations, objects of the same, and all<br/>
							The data of our knowledge — learning these<br/>
							I left the world to lead the homeless life.</p>

							The Brethren and the Sisters, who have found<br/>
							And seen salvation's system and its way,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
							The holy seer did win enlightenment ...<br/>
							0 welcome wast thou then to me who now,<br/>
							Have lived and studied at my Buddha's feet! ...<br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[249]</b></span> The greater Triple Veda have I won,<br/>
							The training in the Buddha's Rule is done.<br/>
							I know as what I lived in times gone by,<br/>
							Clear is the vision of the heavenly eye;<br/>
							And magic power, the threefold lore is mine,<br/>
							And thoughts of others can my thought divine."</p>
