					<p class="f4">A great number of brethren were once staying among the Kosalese<br/>
					in a certain forest-tract.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they were muddled in mind,<br/>
					puffed up,<br/>
					vain,<br/>
					noisy,<br/>
					loose of speech,<br/>
					heedless,<br/>
					unintelligent,<br/>
					without concentration,<br/>
					unsteady in mind,<br/>
					uncontrolled in faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the deva who haunted that forest,<br/>
					moved with compassion for those brethren,<br/>
					desiring their welfare,<br/>
					and wishing to agitate them,<br/>
					drew near and addressed them in the verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Happy the bhikkhus as they lived of yore,<br/>
							Who true disciples were of Gotama.<br/>
							Unhankering they sought their frugal alms,<br/>
							Unhankering, their lodging and their couch.<br/>
							The impermanence of things they understood,<br/>
							And hence of misery they made an end.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Now, making evil-doers of themselves,<br/>
							Like headmen of the village [taking toll],<br/>
							Longing for what their neighbours' house contains,<br/>
							They eat and eat until they sink to rest.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The Order [as a whole] I humbly greet;<br/>
							To some of those here met I homage pay.<br/>
							Others, forlorn and leader-less are they,<br/>
							As cast out bodies of the dead are they.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">My message is for them who heedless live.<br/>
							To earnest diligent souls I say, All hail!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those brethren, agitated by the deva, were greatly moved.</p>
