					<p class="f4">A certain brother was once staying among the Kosalese<br/>
					in a certain forest-tract.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now while there that brother,<br/>
					after he had returned from his alms-round and had broken his fast,<br/>
					plunged into the lotus-pool<br/>
					and sniffed up<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the perfume of a red lotus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the deva who haunted that forest-tract,<br/>
					moved with compassion for that brother,<br/>
					desiring his welfare,<br/>
					and wishing to agitate him,<br/>
					drew near and addressed him in the verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"That blossom, child of water,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> thing not given,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
							Thou standest sniffing up the scent of it.<br/>
							This is one class of things that may be stolen.<br/>
							And thee a smell-thief must I call, dear sir."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[261]</b></span> [The Brother: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Nay, nought I bear away, I nothing break.<br/>
							Standing apart I smell the water's child.<br/>
							Now for what reason am I smell-thief called?<br/>
							One who doth dig up water-lilies, one<br/>
							Who feeds on lotuses, in motley tasks<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
							Engaged: — why hast thou no such name for him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Deva: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"A<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> man of ruthless, wicked character,<br/>
							Foul-flecked as is a handmaid's dirty cloth: —<br/>
							With such the words I say have no concern.<br/>
							But this't is meet that I should say [to thee]: —<br/>
							To him whose character is void of vice,<br/>
							Who ever maketh quest for what is pure: —<br/>
							What to the wicked but a hair-tip seems,<br/>
							To him doth great as any cloud<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> appear."</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Brother: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"In truth, 0 fairy, thou dost know me well,<br/>
							And kind compassion for me moved thy heart -<br/>
							I prithee, fairy, speak to me again<br/>
							Whenever thou dost see me do the like."</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Deva: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Neither<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> am I dependent upon thee,<br/>
							Nor yet hath guilty deed by thee been done.<br/>
							But thou, 0 almsman, thou thyself shouldst know<br/>
							How thou to blissful destiny mayst go."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that brother, agitated by the deva, was greatly moved.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Upasinghati:</i> the compound form I have only found at <i>Jāt.</i> ii, 339.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Almost equivalent in Pali to 'thing stolen.' It was, of course, a device of the fairy's to gain his (or her) end by shooting beyond the mark with this exaggerated figure. 'So occupied, he will get into sensuous ways, and cravings will arise,' the monitor thinks. <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Ākiṇṇa,</i> lit. 'scattered,' ' heaped,' is by B.'s exegesis made to connote (a) impure, (b) hard, 'ruthless' or <i>ludda,</i> as in line 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> The distribution of these lines between the two parties is not easy. The <i>Comy.</i> makes no effort to distinguish, and only explains that it is they in whom is the capacity for salvation in this life who are meet to be admonished, not they who are 'past praying for.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> 'Like the crest of a <i>valāhaka</i>' (cloud). <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> The sceptical fairy judges that he will lean on his mindful monitor and live a slacker, and so 'I will not consent.' <i>Comy.</i></p>
