					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> 'Peak and yakkha each derived its name from the other,' is B.'s only and quaint comment. An 'Indako yakkho' finds mention in <i>Petavatthu,</i> II, 9, 65 f. The myth of the yakkha, and its evolution still, I believe, await investigation. The English equivalent does not exist. 'Geni' (<i>djinn</i>) is perhaps nearest (<i>cf.</i> <i>Pss. of the Sisters,</i> p. 30). In the early records, yakkha as an appellative is, like <i>nāga,</i> anything but depreciative. Not only is Sakka so called (<i>M.</i> i, 252), but the Buddha himself is so referred to, in poetic diction (<i>M.</i> i, 386). We have seen Kakudha, son of the gods, so addressed (II, 2, § 8); and in <i>D.</i> ii, 170 (<i>Dialogues,</i> ii, 200), the city of the gods, Ālakamandā, is described as 'crowded with Yakkhas' ('gods'). They have a deva's supernormal powers, and are capable of putting very pertinent problems in metaphysic and ethics. But they were decadent divinities, degraded in the later era, when the stories to the <i>Jātaka</i> verses were set down, to the status of red-eyed cannibal ogres. <i>Cf.</i> the older and newer view together in <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 245.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Jivaṃ,</i> the vital principle constituting the entity or person proper, B.: <i>satta, puggala.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Nvayaṃ — nu ayaṃ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Yaka(-na),</i> liver, used symbolically for all the soft parts. B. specifies 900 fleshy units.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> The point in the reply is that the embryo evolves into the shape we know by laws of physical growth, and not by the instantaneous materialization wrought by a soul's <i>fiat. Cf.</i> the argument as applied in the <i>Kathāvatthu</i> (xiv, 2; <i>Points of Controversy,</i> p. 284), and the interesting pendant supplied by Lucretius in his maintaining cosmic law: —</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Nam fierent juvenes subito ex infantibu'parvis, etc. De Rerum,</i> I, 159#.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The yakkha, says B., is clearly an Animist (<i>Puggalavādin</i>). The <i>Comy.</i> gives interesting details in contemporaneous embryology quoting gāthās from an untraced source on the subject.</p>
