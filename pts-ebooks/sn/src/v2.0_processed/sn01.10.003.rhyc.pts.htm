					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br/>
					Khara the yakkha and Suciloma the yakkha<br/>

					not far from the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Khara said to Suciloma:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's a friar."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No [replied the other], that's not a friar,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then Suciloma came up to the Exalted One<br/>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One bent his body away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Suciloma said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dost fear me, friar?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, friend, I fear thee not,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> An expressive statue of the yakkha Suciloma is among the bas-reliefs of the Bharhut Stupa (Cunningham, p. 136). It and those of other yakkhas compare favourably with presentations of devas. The Stone Couch is, in the <i>Sutta Nipāta Comy.</i> (i, 301), described as a long slab of rock resting on four upright rocks. Gaya comprised both a town and a landing-stage, and the Couch was at the latter, but not far from the town-gate. Here the Master sat, awaiting his two converts-to-be.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Samaṇa, samaṇaka,</i> the affix 'of appurtenance' here has, as is often the case, a diminutive and contemptuous value.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Fausböll's 'sinful' is misleading. B. says: 'shameful or unpleasant, to be avoided like dirt, fire, or a black snake, not to be acquiesced in by that golden-hued body,' so he 'bent away slightly as when one bends back the golden envelope of a piece of jewelry. Now the yakkha had hairs (<i>loma</i>) over the body like tapestry needles (<i>sūci</i>); these he erected, assuming a horrid shape with wide-opened mouth.' Khara is described as having scales like a crocodile's back. Both cases were results of thefts from 'the Order' in a former birth.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Either by making an appalling sight of himself before the Buddha, or by uttering fearful sounds, etc. <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> The verses are in <i>triṣṭhubh</i> metre, interrupted by two <i>ślokas</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> The simile is explained by B. as I give it: Boys pass a string round a crow's leg and their finger, and pull it down in its flight; so our evil thoughts springing from ourselves are pulled back again into consciousness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a></sup> <i>Taṇhā-snehato jātā.</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <i>Ito attabhāvato jātā.</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>
