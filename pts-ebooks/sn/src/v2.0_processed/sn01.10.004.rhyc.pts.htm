							In harmlessness, in kindness<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> takes delight,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> These names have not been met with elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Feer found the first stanza in his Burmese MS. only, and prints it in brackets. They are possibly interpolated to let the Exalted One make the usual response, for Buddhaghosa takes no notice of the corrected view, but comments only on the 'Not wholly,' etc.x</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> I have inserted this term as representing the positive meaning of the negative term (<i>a-hiṇsā</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> The last two lines occur in the <i>Cakkavāka Jātaka</i> (iv, 71). B. gives <i>mettaṃ so</i> and <i>mettaṃso</i> as alternative interpretations. The <i>Jāt.</i> <i>Comy.</i> gives only the one I have adopted (<i>mettā-aṇso, koṭṭhāso</i>).</p>
