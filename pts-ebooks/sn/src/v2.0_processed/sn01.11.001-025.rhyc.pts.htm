					will be overcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">If ye look not up to the crest of my banner,<br/>

					<p class="f4">If ye do so,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now, bhikkhus, in them that look up to the crest of one or other of these four banners,<br/>
					any fear and panic<br/>

					may be overcome,<br/>
					or again it may not.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because Sakka, ruler of the gods,<br/>
					is not purged of passions, hate, or ignorance,<br/>
					is timid,<br/>
					given to panic,<br/>
					to fright,<br/>
					to running away.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But I say thus unto you, bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">If in you<br/>
					when ye have gone into forests,<br/>
					to the roots of trees,<br/>
					to empty places,<br/>
					fear and panic and creeping of the flesh should arise,<br/>
					do ye in that hour only call me to mind and think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, that is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					supremely enlightened,<br/>
					proficient in knowledge and in conduct,<br/>
					the Blessed One,<br/>
					who understands the world,<br/>
					peerless tamer and driver of the hearts of men,<br/>
					the Master,<br/>
					the Buddha for gods and men,<br/>
					Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For if ye so call me to mind, bhikkhus,<br/>
					any fear,<br/>
					panic,<br/>
					creeping of the flesh that will have arisen<br/>
					will be overcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if ye cannot call me to mind,<br/>
					call to mind the Norm, and think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/>
					relating to the present,<br/>
					immediate in its results,<br/>
					inviting all,<br/>
					giving gidance,<br/>
					appealing to each,<br/>
					to be understood by them that can understand.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For if ye so call the Norm to mind<br/>
					your fear,<br/>
					panic,<br/>
					creeping of the flesh that will have arisen<br/>
					will be overcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if ye cannot call the Norm to mind,<br/>
					then call to mind the Order, and think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well practised is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br/>
					practised in integrity,<br/>
					in intellectual methods,<br/>
					in right lines of action — to wit<br/>
					the four pairs,<br/>
					the eight groups of persons<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span>: —<br/>
					this is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>

					the world's peerless field for merit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For if ye so call the Order to mind,<br/>
					your fear,<br/>
					panic,<br/>
					creeping of the flesh will be overcome.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span> And why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the Tathāgata, bhikkhus,<br/>
					Arahant<br/>
					Supremely Enlightened,<br/>
					is purged of passion,<br/>
					hate,<br/>
					ignorance,<br/>
					is without timidity<br/>
					or panic<br/>
					or fright,<br/>
					and fleeth not."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus said the Exalted One,<br/>
					and the Blessed One so saying,<br/>
					the Master spake yet further: —</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whene'er in forest or in leafy shade<br/>
					      Or lonely empty places ye abide,<br/>
					      Call to your mind, bhikkhus, th'Enlightened One;<br/>
					      No fear, no sense of peril will ye know.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Or if ye cannot on the Buddha think —<br/>
					      The chief, the senior of the world, the Bull of men —<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>
					      Then call the Norm to mind, the well-taught guide.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Or if ye cannot think upon the Norm —<br/>
					      The well-taught doctrine wherein guidance lies —<br/>
					      Then turn your thoughts to the Fraternity,<br/>
					      Unrivalled field where men may sow good deeds.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If ye in Buddha, Order, Norm thus refuge take,<br/>
					      Fear, panic, creeping of the flesh will never rise.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> B. seems to be ignorant of the bygone lustre of the word Asura — as = Ahura [mazda], and a name of title of Varuṇa He gives his traditional version of the immediate antecedents of Sakka, as a virtuous, public-spirited citizen of a Magadha village, and of his rebirth in the lowest deva-world (on Mt. Sineru, or Meru) as its King. Other versions are given in the Kulāvaka Jātaka (No. 31) and in the Mahāli-pañha story of the <i>Comy.</i> on <i>Dhp.</i> ver. 30 (i, 263 <i>f.</i>). Merely touching on the good works of Sakka as the brahmin Magha, and on his seven Rules of Conduct (see 2, §1 below), he names 33, not 30 co-operating fellow-citizens who were also reborn, as they died, in the same heaven, as if wishing it to be inferred that these became the '33 gods' immediately beneath Sakka (see below, §3). We may presume that, for Buddhists, the thrones and powers of the 33 were relative permanencies, like the Sakkatta (Sakka-hood) of Sakka, occupied successively by long-lived devas. B.'s version of the Asura wars is, that certain devas tried to get the vigorous and virtuous new rulers into their power by doping them with <i>gaṇḍapāna.</i> Sakka warned his comrades to abstain; the plotters alone got dead drunk and were thrown down Sineru. They formed a kingdom below, and lived <i>a-sura,</i> without strong drink, trying from time to time to regain the lost Paradise.</p>

Hence it served both as a bagpipes and as a visible rallying point.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup> This triplet of terms occurs in the Māra and Bhikkhunī Suttas, but not in the other Nikāyas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a></sup> This interesting trio are represented as invoked in the Tevijja Sutta, <i>Dialogues,</i> i, 310. On the first three, see Macdonell's <i>Vedic Mythology.</i> Isāna is an older name for Rudra, called euphemistically Siva (Böthlingk and Roth).

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a></sup> B.'s list of scurrilous epithets is not without interest: 'Thou art a thief, a fool, a bungler <i>(mūḷho),</i> a camel, a bullock, a donkey, a hell-man, a beast; there's neither heaven nor hell to be expected by such as thou.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a></sup> I take the positive forms; none of the negatives givenin the Pali: non-force, etc. — would appeal to us who prefer positive forms of expression.</p>

The gift apparently consisted simply in the king's promise to give orders for their being unmolested, when the fighting came their way. Sakka, B. says, had already conferred <i>(mantetvā)</i> with the Rishis, and the Asuras, wrathful lest this meant an enlisting of Rishis' magic powers, had on one occasion smashed up their hermitage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a></sup> And this, writes B. graphically amplifying the slender narrative of Sambara's nightmares, is how, his mind getting deranged <i>(vipati-citto),</i> he came to be called Vepacitti (crazy-nerve). <i>Cf.</i> below, 3, §3.

I read <i>dhammā</i> as equivalent to the instrumental <i>dhammena.</i> And <i>nikittaye,</i> 'I may not be false, or inconsistent to,' is good Sanskrit, though not yet found in Pali.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a></sup> Here is apparently a curious anomaly in B.'s comments. (1) He has told us that Vepacitti's real name was Sambara, Inda, or ruler of the Asuras (1, §10). (2) He calls the magician or conjurer whose art is known to Vepacitti, or is Vepacitti's, and who practised it, with direful results, Sambaro Asurindo. (3) He explains the last line as 'Sambara ruler of Asuras, a juggler, who, having practised <i>māyā (māyāvī māyaṇ payojetvā)</i> is "roasting" since a century ago in purgatory:' — and all without making any distinction between any two Sambaras. The only inference is that there was a post of Sambaratta (Sambarahood) as there was of Sakkatta (Sakka-hood), and that the 'late' ruler of the Asuras had an art which was either an heirloom taught to, or an innate talent possessed by each succeeding Sambara. But what an opportunity for our good B. to have missed!<br/>
					The Asuras naturally fear to put more power into Sakka's hands: — 'he will torment us, destroy us!' Vepacitti advises him and his, as honest men <i>(tumhe dhammikā va),</i> to keep clear of it <i>(alaṇ vo na māyāya).</i> The legend adds that Sakka's other offer of healing was to take Vepacitti to beg pardon of the Rishis. But to the champion of 'frightfulness' this was too much.</p>
