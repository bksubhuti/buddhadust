					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, brethren, the causal law.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to it,<br/>
					give your minds thoroughly<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord," responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, brethren, is the causal law?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span> Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br/>
					conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/>
					conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/>
					conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br/>
					conditioned by sense contact,<br/>
					conditioned by contact feeling,<br/>
					conditioned by feeling craving,<br/>
					conditioned by craving grasping,<br/>
					conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/>
					conditioned by becoming birth,<br/>
					conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is called [causal] happening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br/>
					from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/>
					from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/>
					from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br/>
					from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br/>
					from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/>
					from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/>
					from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/>
					from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/>
					from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/>
					from ceasing of birth,<br/>
					old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the Exalted One who spake this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleased in mind<br/>
					those brethren took delight<br/>
					in the saying of the Exalted One.</p>
