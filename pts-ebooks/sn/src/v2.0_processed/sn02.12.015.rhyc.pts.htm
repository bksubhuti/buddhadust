					<p><span class="f2">[16]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">While the Exalted One was at Sāvatthi<br/>
					the venerable Kaccāyana of that clan<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					came to visit him,<br/>
					and saluting him<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he asked the Exalted One,<br/>
					saying: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, we hear the phrase<br/>
					'right view, right view."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now how far is there a 'right view'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This world, Kaccayana,<br/>
					usually bases [its view) on two things:<br/>
					on existence and on non-existence.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now he, who with right insight<br/>
					sees the uprising of the <span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span> world as it really is,<br/>
					does not hold with the non-existence of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he, who with right insight<br/>
					sees the passing away of the world as it really is,<br/>
					does not hold with the existence of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grasping after systems,<br/>
					imprisoned by dogmas<br/>
					is this world, Kaccayana,<br/>
					for the most part.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the man who does not go after that system-grasping,<br/>
					that mental standpoint,<br/>
					that dogmatic bias,<br/>
					who does not grasp at it,<br/>
					does not take up his stand upon it,<br/>
					[does not think]: —</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is my soul!<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">— who thinks: —</p>

					<p class="f4">'That which arises is just Ill,<br/>
					that which passes away is Ill'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"> — this man is not in doubt,<br/>
					is not perplexed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge herein is his<br/>
					that is not merely another's.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far, Kaccayana, he has right view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Everything exists: — this is one extreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nothing exists: — this is the other extreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not approaching either extreme the Tathāgata teaches you a doctrine by the middle [way]: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance<br/>
					activities come to pass,<br/>
					conditioned by activities<br/>
					consciousness;<br/>
					thus conditioned [arises] name-and-shape;<br/>
					and sense arises,<br/>
					contact,<br/>
					feeling,<br/>
					craving,<br/>
					grasping,<br/>
					becoming,<br/>
					birth,<br/>
					decay-and-death,<br/>
					grief, suffering,<br/>
					unhappiness,<br/>
					despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away<br/>
					and ceasing of ignorance<br/>
					[arises] ceasing of activities,<br/>
					and thus comes ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> No comment on this person is made. On Kaccāna's in the Order see <i>Pss of the Brethren,</i> pp. 142, 238. The episode is retold by Ānanda in the third volume of these <i>Sayings</i> when he is teaching Channa (iii, Sutta No.90). <i>Cf.</i> H. Warren's translation in <i>Buddhism in Translations,</i> p. 165.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> 'In the doubled term the question includes whatever the wise — devas and men — declare to be right vision.' <i>Comy.</i> 'We hear the phrase' is, literally. ... 'is said.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> According to B. Eternalists held that 'in the conditioned world' once existing means always existing; Annihilationists held that nothing existing persisted always. It is on the surface curious that the arguuments with the school tending to maintain the former 'extreme' — the Sabbatthivādins or Sarvāstivādins, given in the Kathāvatthu (<i>Points of Controversy,</i> pp. 85<i>f</i>.; <i>cf.</i> 375<i>f</i>.) do not cite this Sutta. See <i>Buddhism.</i> p. 82 <i>f.</i> and Introduction. Existence <i>(atthitā)</i> is apparently understood in the Parmenidean sense: incapable of absolute dissoluution. The <i>Comy.</i> explains the midway vision thus: — no one who discerns the dissolution of phenomena in the conditioned universe is an Eternalist. No one who discerns the evolution of phenomena in it is an Annihilationist.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Feer's text reads <i>attā na me ti</i> (wrongly divided in the text). The <i>Comy.</i> reads <i>attā me ti.</i> Either can be read consistently with the context. We can either read (rendering freely) 'who does not follow those convictions, [who thinks] "it is <i>not</i> my soul,"' or 'whose convicctions do not lead him to think, "it is my soul."'</p>
