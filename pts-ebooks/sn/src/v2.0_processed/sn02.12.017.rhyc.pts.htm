					<p><span class="f2">[18]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[14]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha,<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-Ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One in the early morning dressed himself,<br/>
					and taking bowl and robe<br/>
					entered Rājagaha, for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Kassapa the Unclothed<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> saw the Exalted One coming from afar,<br/>
					and seeing him<br/>
					he came up to the Exalted One and greeted him,<br/>
					and when compliments of friendship and courtesy had been exchanged<br/>
					he stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So standing Kassapa the Unclothed said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We would fain ask Master <span class="f2 g"><b>[15]</b></span> Gotama concerning one point,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					if he would give us opportunity<br/>
					of hearing him reply to our question."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is untimely just now for questions, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">We have entered the village."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But a second time Kassapa Kassapa the Unclothed said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We would fain ask Master Gotama concerning one point,<br/>
					if he would give us opportunity<br/>
					of hearing him reply to our question."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time The Exalted One responded:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is untimely just now for questions, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">We have entered the village."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time Kassapa Kassapa the Unclothed said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We would fain ask Master Gotama concerning one point,<br/>
					if he would give us opportunity<br/>
					of hearing him reply to our question."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time The Exalted One responded:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is untimely just now for questions, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">We have entered the village."</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Exalted One had thus spoken,<br/>
					Kassapa the Unclothed said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not many things<br/>
					we are fain to ask of Master Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ask, Kassapa, what you will."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now then, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is suffering wrought by one's self?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so verily, Kassapa,"<br/>
					said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is one's suffering wrought by another?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so verily, Kassapa,"<br/>
					said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is suffering wrought both by one's self<br/>
					and by another?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so verily, Kassapa,"<br/>
					said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, Master Gotama,<br/>
					has [the] suffering [which is] wrought neither by myself<br/>
					nor by another,<br/>
					befallen me by chance?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so verily, Kassapa,"<br/>
					said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is suffering non-existent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, Kassapa, suffering is not non-existent;<br/>
					suffering is."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then Master Gotama<br/>
					neither knows nor sees suffering?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, Kassapa, I am not one who knows not suffering<br/>
					nor sees it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one that knows suffering, Kassapa,<br/>
					I am one that sees suffering."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How now, Master Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br/>
					'is suffering wrought by one's self?'<br/>
					you have answered:<br/>
					'Not so verily, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br/>
					'What then, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is one's suffering wrought by another?'<br/>
					you have answered:<br/>
					'Not so verily, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br/>
					'What then, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is suffering wrought both by one's self<br/>
					and by another?'<br/>
					you have answered:<br/>
					'Not so verily, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br/>
					'What then, Master Gotama,<br/>
					has [the] suffering [which is] wrought neither by myself<br/>
					nor by another,<br/>
					befallen me by chance?'<br/>
					you have answered:<br/>
					'Not so verily, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br/>
					'What then, Master Gotama,<br/>
					is suffering non-existent?'<br/>
					you have answered:<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[16]</b></span> 'Not so verily, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br/>
					'Then Master Gotama<br/>
					neither knows nor sees suffering?'<br/>
					you have answered:<br/>
					'Nay, Kassapa, I am not one who knows not suffering<br/>
					nor sees it.<br/>
					I am one that knows suffering, Kassapa,<br/>
					I am one that sees suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Declare then to me, Master, Exalted One,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					[the nature of] suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Teach me, Master, Exalted One,<br/>
					the nature of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'One and the same person<br/>
					both acts and experiences [the results]'</p>

					<p class="f4">-this, Kassapa, which you called at first</p>

					<p class="f4">'suffering self-wrought,'</p>

					<p class="f4">amounts to the Eternalist theory.</p>

					<p class="f4">'One acts,<br/>
					another experiences [the result]'</p>

					<p class="f4">this, Kassapa, which<br/>
					to one smitten by the feeling<br/>
					occurs as</p>

					<p class="f4">'suffering caused by another,'</p>

					<p class="f4">amounts to the Annihilationist theory.</p>

					<p class="f4">To you, Kassapa, the Tathāgata,<br/>
					not approaching either extreme,<br/>
					teaches the Norm by a middle [way]:</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass,<br/>
					conditioned by activities consciousness;<br/>
					conditioned by consciousness, name-and-shape;<br/>
					conditioned by name-and-shape, sense;<br/>
					conditioned by sense, contact;<br/>
					conditioned by contact, feeling;<br/>
					conditioned by feeling, craving;<br/>
					conditioned by craving, grasping;<br/>
					conditioned by grasping, becoming;<br/>
					conditioned by becoming,<br/>
					birth,<br/>
					decay-and-death,<br/>
					grief,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br/>
					from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/>
					from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/>
					from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br/>
					from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br/>
					from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/>
					from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/>
					from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/>
					from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/>
					from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/>
					from ceasing of birth,<br/>
					old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said Kassapa the Unclothed said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br/>
					that which had been thrown down,<br/>
					or were to reveal<br/>
					that which was hidden away,<br/>
					or were to point out the right road<br/>
					to him who had gone astray,<br/>
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness,<br/>
					so that those who had eyes could see shapes, -<br/>
					even so, lord, has the lord Gotama shown me<br/>
					his doctrine in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, even I, lord, betake myself to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br/>
					to the Norm<br/>
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would leave the world<br/>
					under the Rule of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would be ordained."</p>

					<p class="f4">"He, Kassapa, who, being formerly a votary of another doctrine,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					desires to leave the world<br/>
					to obtain orders in this Doctrine and Rule,<br/>
					remains on probation for four months.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the end of four months<br/>
					spent in seclusion,<br/>
					the brethren,<br/>
					moved in heart and willing,<br/>
					receive him from the world<br/>
					and <span class="f2 g"><b>[17]</b></span> ordain him to be a brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless, I acknowledge a difference in persons."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, lord, he who, formerly a votary of another doctrine,<br/>
					desires to leave the world,<br/>
					to obtain orders in this Doctrine and Rule,<br/>
					goes on probation for four months,<br/>
					and if at the end of four months<br/>
					spent in seclusion,<br/>
					the brethren,<br/>
					moved in heart and willing,<br/>
					receive him from the world<br/>
					and ordain him to be a brother,<br/>
					I will live on probation for four years.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the end of four years<br/>
					so living<br/>
					may the brethren,<br/>
					moved in heart and will,<br/>
					receive me<br/>
					and ordain me as a brother."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Kassapa the Unclothed was received<br/>
					under the Exalted One<br/>
					and obtained ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br/>
					the venerable Kassapa,<br/>
					remaining alone and separate,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and strenuous,<br/>
					attained ere long<br/>
					to that supreme goal of the divine life,<br/>
					for the sake of which the clansmen<br/>
					rightly go forth from home into the homeless:<br/>
					yea, that supreme goal did he,<br/>
					by himself,<br/>
					even in this present life,<br/>
					come to understand and realize,<br/>
					namely, that birth was destroyed,<br/>
					that the divine life was lived,<br/>
					that the task was done,<br/>
					that for life in these conditions<br/>
					there was no hereafter.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And that venerable Kassapa became one of the Arahants.</p>
