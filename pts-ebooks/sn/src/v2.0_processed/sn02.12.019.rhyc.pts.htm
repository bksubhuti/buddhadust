					<p><span class="f2">[23]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[19]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For the fool, brethren,<br/>
					cloaked by ignorance<br/>
					and tied to craving,<br/>
					this body is wrought on this wise:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is just this body<br/>
					and names-and-shapes without:<br/>
					thus this pair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of the pair [there is] contact,<br/>
					just six spheres of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by these,<br/>
					or by one of them,<br/>
					the fool experiences pleasure and pain.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">For the wise man, brethren,<br/>
					cloaked by ignorance<br/>
					and tied to craving<br/>
					this body is wrought on this wise:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is just this body<br/>
					and names-and-shapes without:<br/>
					thus this pair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of the pair [there is] contact,<br/>
					just six spheres of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by these,<br/>
					or by one of them,<br/>
					the wise man experiences pleasure and pain.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What, brethren, is there here that is different,<br/>
					distinctive,<br/>
					diverse<br/>
					between the wise man and the fool?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root,<br/>
					their guide,<br/>
					their resort.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br/>
					if the meaning <span class="f2 g"><b>[20]</b></span> of this that he has spoken<br/>
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/>
					the brethren will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, brethren,<br/>
					listen,<br/>
					give your mind thoroughly<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/>
					responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ignorance, brethren,<br/>
					wherewith the fool,<br/>
					whose body is so wrought,<br/>
					is cloaked,<br/>
					the craving whereto he is tied,<br/>
					that ignorance the fool has not thrown off,<br/>
					that craving is not withered away.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">The fool has not lived the divine life<br/>
					for the right withering away of ill,<br/>
					therefore the fool<br/>
					at the breaking up of the body<br/>
					is on his way to [another]<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> body.</p>

					<p class="f4">He being on his way thither<br/>
					is not set free from birth,<br/>
					nor from old age<br/>
					and death,<br/>
					nor from grievings,<br/>
					from lamentings,<br/>
					from ills,<br/>
					from sorrows,<br/>
					from despairs -</p>

					<p class="f4">I say, he is not set free from Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The ignorance, brethren,<br/>
					wherewith the wise man,<br/>
					whose body is so wrought,<br/>
					is cloaked,<br/>
					the craving whereto he is tied,<br/>
					that ignorance the wise man has thrown off,<br/>
					and that craving is withered away.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">The wise man has lived the divine life<br/>
					for the right withering away of ill,<br/>
					therefore the wise man<br/>
					at the breaking up of the body<br/>
					is not on his way to [another sense-] body.</p>

					<p class="f4">He not being on his way thither<br/>
					is set free from rebirth,<br/>
					from old age<br/>
					and death,<br/>
					from grievings,<br/>
					from lamentings,<br/>
					from ills,<br/>
					from sorrows,<br/>
					from despairs -</p>

					<p class="f4">I say, he is set free from Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is how the wise man is different,<br/>
					distinctive,<br/>
					diverse from the fool,<br/>
					namely in that he lives the divine life."</p>
