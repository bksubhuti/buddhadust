					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, brethren,<br/>
					both causal happening<br/>
					and things as having causally happened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hear ye this,<br/>
					give your mind thoroughly,<br/>
					I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[21]</b></span> "Even so, lord",<br/>
					those brethren made response to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by rebirth is decay and death:</p>

Cause orders (or fixes) phenomena, therefore it is called orderliness of phenomena. The causes of birth, etc., are specific ("this") causes, and specific causes are just this-relatedness.'</p>
