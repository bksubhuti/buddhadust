					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Tathāgata, brethren,<br/>
					endowed with the ten powers,<br/>
					and the four confidences,<br/>
					claims the Place of the Bull;<br/>
					he roars the Lion's Roar amid the congregations;<br/>
					he turns the Divine Wheel,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is material shape,<br/>
					such is its arising,<br/>
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such is feeling,<br/>
					such is its arising,<br/>
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such is perception,<br/>
					such is its arising,<br/>
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such are activities,<br/>
					such is its arising,<br/>
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such is consciousness,<br/>
					such is its arising,<br/>
					such is its passing away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This' being,<br/>
					'that' becomes;<br/>
					from the arising of this,<br/>
					that arises;<br/>
					this not being,<br/>
					that becomes not;<br/>
					from the ceasing of this,<br/>
					that ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say,<br/>
					Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br/>
					conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/>
					conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/>
					conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br/>
					conditioned by sense contact,<br/>
					conditioned by contact feeling,<br/>
					conditioned by feeling craving,<br/>
					conditioned by craving <span class="f2 g"><b>[24]</b></span> grasping,<br/>
					conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/>
					conditioned by becoming birth,<br/>
					conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br/>
					from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/>
					from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/>
					from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br/>
					from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br/>
					from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/>
					from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/>
					from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/>
					from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/>
					from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/>
					from ceasing of birth,<br/>
					old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, brethren, the Norm being well declared by me,<br/>
					made manifest,<br/>
					disclosed,<br/>
					brought to light,<br/>
					stripped of its swathings,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					it is enough for the clansman<br/>
					who has left the world through faith<br/>
					to stir up energy<br/>
					and vow:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Verily let skin and sinews and bones wilt in my body,<br/>
					let flesh and blood dry up,<br/>
					yet shall there be upkeep of energy<br/>
					till I have won<br/>
					that which by man's strength,<br/>
					by man's energy,<br/>
					by man's progress<br/>
					may be won!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Sadly, brethren,<br/>
					lives the man of sloth,<br/>
					involved in bad,<br/>
					wicked things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great is the salvation<br/>
					which he fails to win.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he of stirred up energy<br/>
					lives happily,<br/>
					aloof from bad,<br/>
					wicked things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great is the salvation<br/>
					that he makes perfect.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not by that which is low, brethren,<br/>
					may the highest be won;<br/>
					by that which is highest<br/>
					may the highest be won.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of praise, brethren,<br/>
					is this divine life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Teacher has come to you<br/>
					face to face.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore stir up energy<br/>
					that ye may win<br/>
					what is not won,<br/>
					that ye may attain<br/>
					what is not attained,<br/>
					that ye may realize<br/>
					what is unrealized.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus will this<br/>
					our leaving the world<br/>
					not be barren,<br/>
					but a fruitful<br/>
					and a growing thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily the necessaries that we enjoy:<br/>
					the equipment of robes,<br/>
					alms,<br/>
					lodging<br/>
					and medicine,<br/>
					though they be humble,<br/>
					shall be to us<br/>
					of great profit<br/>
					and advantage.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For thus, brethren,<br/>
					must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man discern his own good,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					this is enough to call up earnestness;<br/>
					if <span class="f2 g"><b>[25]</b></span> he discern another's good,<br/>
					this is enough to call up earnestness;<br/>
					if he discern both his own and another's good,<br/>
					this is enough to call up earnestness.</p>
