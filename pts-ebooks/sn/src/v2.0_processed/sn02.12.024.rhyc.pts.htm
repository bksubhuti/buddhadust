					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta clothed himself one morning,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta came to those gardens,<br/>
					and after exchanging greetings with those heretical Wanderers<br/>
					and compliments of friendship and courtesy<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Wanderers spoke thus<br/>
					to the venerable Sāriputta so seated:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					certain recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					believers in karma,<br/>
					who declare that ill is self-wrought;<br/>
					certain others of them<br/>

					certain others declare that ill is wrought by both,<br/>
					and certain others<br/>
					that ill is wrought by neither,<br/>
					but happens by chance.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the recluse Gotama -<br/>

					<p class="f4">And how, if we were answering,<br/>

					by a doctrine in conformity with his doctrine,<br/>
					and [one whereby] no one who is of his doctrine,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, the Exalted One has said<br/>

					<p class="f4">Because of what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda was listening<br/>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					after going his almsround in Rājagaha<br/>
					and eating his meal on his return,<br/>
