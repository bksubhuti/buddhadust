					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Upavāna<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him,<br/>
					sat down at one side,<br/>
					and so seated said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, there are certain recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					believers in karma,<br/>
					who declare that ill is self-wrought;<br/>
					certain others of them<br/>
					declare ill is wrought by some one other [than one's self];<br/>
					certain others declare that ill is wrought by both,<br/>
					and certain others<br/>
					that ill is wrought by neither,<br/>
					but happens by chance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Lord, what has the Exalted One to announce to us<br/>
					and how, if we were answering,<br/>
					should we be repeating his views correctly<br/>
					and would not be misrepresenting him<br/>
					by what is not correct,<br/>
					but would be answering by a doctrine<br/>
					in conformity with his doctrine,<br/>
					and one whereby no one who is of his doctrine,<br/>
					a follower of his views,<br/>
					would render himself open to blame?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have said Upavāna<br/>
					that ill comes to pass through a cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who so spoke would be repeating my views,<br/>
					and would not be misrepresenting me<br/>
					by what is not correct,<br/>
					but would be answering by a doctrine<br/>
					in conformity with my doctrine,<br/>
					and one whereby no one who is of my doctrine,<br/>
					a follower of my views,<br/>
					would render himself open to blame.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of those recluses and brahmins, Upavāna,<br/>
					who believing in karma<br/>
					declare that ill has been wrought by one's own self,<br/>
					this ill was caused by contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of those of them<br/>
					who declare that ill has been wrought by a different self,<br/>
					this ill too was caused by contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of those of them<br/>
					who declare that ill has been wrought by both one's own self<br/>
					and by a different self,<br/>
					this ill too was caused by contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case also of those<br/>
					who declare that ill has been wrought by neither,<br/>
					but has happened by chance,<br/>
					this ill too was caused by contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">In no one of these four views<br/>
					of those who believe in karma<br/>
					is it possible to show<br/>
					that those recluses and brahmins<br/>
					will experience feeling without contact."</p>
