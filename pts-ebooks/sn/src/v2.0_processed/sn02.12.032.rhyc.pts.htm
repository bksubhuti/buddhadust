					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brother Kaḷāra of the nobles<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					went into the presence of the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					and exchanging with him greetings<br/>
					and the compliments of friendship and courtesy,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Moliya-Phagguna,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					has renounced the training<br/>
					and turned to lower things."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then that venerable brother<br/>
					will not have found comfort<br/>
					in this Norm and Discipline."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I gather that the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					has found comfort<br/>
					in this Norm and Discipline."</p>

					<p class="f4">"<i>I</i> have no doubt about it, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But as to the future, friend?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am not worried about it, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Kaḷāra the noble rose from his seat,<br/>
					went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/>
					and saluting him<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I know, lord, that the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					has declared [he has won saving] knowledge,<br/>
					that birth is [for him] destroyed,<br/>
					that the divine life has been lived,<br/>
					that what was to do is done,<br/>
					that there is nothing further of these conditions."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed a certain brother:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come thou, brother, tell my word to Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Master, friend Sāriputta, is speaking to you.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/>
					responded that brother,<br/>
					and he went and told the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Master, friend Sāriputta, is speaking to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friend,"<br/>
					responded Sāriputta,<br/>
					and he came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[39]</b></span> To him so seated the Exalted One said:</p>

					and that there is for you<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Not in these words, lord,<br/>
					not in this form<br/>
					did I	speak	of the matter."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In whatever way, Sāriputta,<br/>
					a clansman declares [the winning of saving] knowledge,<br/>
					the declaration must be considered as such."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But did I not say, lord,<br/>
					that I did not speak of the matter<br/>
					in those words,<br/>
					in that form?"</p>

					nothing further of these conditions?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should I make answer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is because, friend,<br/>
					in [the word] "destroyed"<br/>
					I have discerned<br/>
