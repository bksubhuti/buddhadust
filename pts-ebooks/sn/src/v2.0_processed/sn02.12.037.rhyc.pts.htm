					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This body, brethren, is not your own,<br/>
					neither is it that of any others.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It should be regarded<br/>
					as brought about by action of the past,<br/>
					by plans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					by volitions,<br/>
					by feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span> Now here, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					gives his mind thoroughly and systematically<br/>
					to the causal law, to wit,</p>

					<p class="f4">'This being,<br/>
					that comes to be;<br/>
					from the arising of this,<br/>
					that arises;<br/>
					this not being,<br/>
					that ceases;<br/>
					from the ceasing of this,<br/>
					that ceases.'</p>

					<p class="f4">To wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br/>
					conditioned by activities consciousness,<br/>
					conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br/>
					conditioned by name-and-shape six-fold-sense,<br/>
					conditioned by six-fold-sense contact,<br/>
					conditioned by contact feeling,<br/>
					conditioned by feeling craving,<br/>
					conditioned by craving grasping,<br/>
					conditioned by grasping becoming,<br/>
					conditioned by becoming birth,<br/>
					conditioned by birth old age-and death,<br/>
					grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br/>
					from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br/>
					from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br/>
					from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of six-fold-sense;<br/>
					from ceasing of six-fold-sense ceasing of contact;<br/>
					from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br/>
					from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br/>
					from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br/>
					from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br/>
					from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br/>
					from ceasing of birth,<br/>
					old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This is to be understood as the same doctrine set out in Nos. 17, 18. Your present <i>kāya</i> (body, person) is not an entity always self-identical, nor is it different from an entity other than any past 'you.' It is the outcome of the <i>kāyas</i> in the past series of your lives. The <i>Comy.</i> bears out this interpretation.</p>
