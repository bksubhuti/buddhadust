					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, brethren,<br/>
					how ill arises<br/>
					and how it passes away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to this,<br/>
					give your minds thoroughly,<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord",<br/>
					responded the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, brethren, is the arising of ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of sight and visible objects<br/>
					visual consciousness arises,<br/>
					contact is the clash of the three;<br/>
					feeling is conditioned by the contact,<br/>
					craving by the feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is the arising of ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of hearing and audible objects<br/>
					consciousness of sound arises,<br/>
					contact is the clash of the three;<br/>
					feeling is conditioned by the contact,<br/>
					craving by the feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is the arising of ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of nose and odorous objects<br/>

					<p class="f4">Because of tongue and sapid objects<br/>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, is the passing away of ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of sight and visible objects<br/>
