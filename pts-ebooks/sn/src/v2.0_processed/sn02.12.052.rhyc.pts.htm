					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In him, brethren, who contemplates<br/>
					the enjoyment that there is<br/>
					in all that makes for grasping,<br/>
					craving grows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there should be a blazing bonfire<br/>
					of ten<br/>
					or twenty<br/>
					or thirty<br/>
					or forty<br/>
					loads of faggots;<br/>
					thereon a man should throw from time to time<br/>
					dry grasses,<br/>
					should throw dry cow-dung,<br/>
					should throw dry faggots.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily such a great bonfire so fed,<br/>
					so supplied with fuel,<br/>
					would burn for a long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates<br/>
					the enjoyment that there is<br/>
					in all that makes for grasping,<br/>
					craving grows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, brethren, who contemplates the misery that there is<br/>
					in all that makes for grasping,<br/>
					craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there should be a blazing bonfire<br/>
					of ten,<br/>
					or twenty,<br/>
					or thirty,<br/>
					or forty<br/>
					loads of faggots;<br/>
					thereon no man should<br/>
					from time to time<br/>
					throw dry grasses,<br/>
					dry cow-dung,<br/>
					dry sticks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily that great bonfire,<br/>
					when the first laid fuel <span class="f2 g"><b>[60]</b></span> were come to an end,<br/>
					and it were not fed by other fuel,<br/>
					would without food<br/>
					become extinct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates<br/>
					the misery that there is<br/>
					in all that makes for grasping,<br/>
					craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>
