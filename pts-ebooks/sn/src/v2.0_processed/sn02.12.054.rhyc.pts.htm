					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is just as if, brethren, because of oil<br/>
					and because of wick,<br/>
					an oil-lamp were to be burning,<br/>
					and in it<br/>
					from time to time<br/>
					a man were to pour oil<br/>
					and to adjust a wick.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily such an oil-lamp<br/>
					so fed,<br/>
					so supplied with fuel<br/>
					would burn for a long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br/>
					in all that makes for enfettering,<br/>
					craving grows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if, because of oil<br/>
					and because of wick,<br/>
					an oil-lamp were to be burning,<br/>
					and in it no man should<br/>
					from time to time<br/>
					pour oil<br/>
					or adjust a wick.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily such an oil-lamp,<br/>
					when its first fuel were come to an end,<br/>
					and no other food were brought to it, would<br/>
					without food<br/>
					become extinct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the misery that there is<br/>
					in all that makes for enfettering,<br/>
					craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>
