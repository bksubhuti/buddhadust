					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In him, brethren, who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br/>
					in all that makes for grasping,<br/>
					there comes a descent of name-and-shape.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Sense is conditioned by name-and-shape.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contact is conditioned by sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling is conditioned by contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is condtitioned by feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a great tree,<br/>
					the roots whereof<br/>
					going downward and across<br/>
					bring upward all the juice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, brethren, such a great tree<br/>
					so fed,<br/>
					so supplied with fuel<br/>
					would stand for a long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br/>
					in all that makes for grasping,<br/>
					there comes a descent of name-and-shape.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense is conditioned by name-and-shape.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contact is conditioned by sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling is conditioned by contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is condtitioned by feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, brethren, who contemplates the misery that there is<br/>
					in all that makes for grasping,<br/>
					there comes no descent of name-and-shape.</p>

					<p class="f4">When name-and-shape ceases, sense ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When sense ceases, contact ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When contact ceases, feeling ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When feeling ceases, craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a great tree,<br/>
					and a man were to come with axe and basket,<br/>
					and were to cut down that tree at the root.</p>

					<p class="f4">Cutting it by the root<br/>
					he were to dig a trench<br/>
					and were to pull out the roots<br/>
					even to the rootlets<br/>
					and root-fibres.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he were to cut the tree into logs,<br/>
					and were then to split the logs,<br/>
					and were then to make the logs into chips.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he were to dry the chips in wind and sun,<br/>
					then burn them by fire,<br/>
					then make an ashheap,<br/>
					then winnow the ashes in a strong wind,<br/>
					or let them be borne down<br/>
					by the swift stream of a river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily that great tree<br/>
					thus cut down at the root<br/>
					would be made as a palmtree stump,<br/>
					a no-thing,<br/>
					incapable of growing again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the misery that there is<br/>
					in all that makes for grasping,<br/>
					there comes no descent of name-and-shape.</p>

					<p class="f4">When name-and-shape ceases, sense ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When sense ceases, contact ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When contact ceases, feeling ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When feeling ceases, craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br/>
					lamenting,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow,<br/>
					despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>
