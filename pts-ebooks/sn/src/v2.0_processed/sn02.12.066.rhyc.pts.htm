					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying among the Kurus,<br/>
					at Kammasadamma,<br/>
					a township of the Kurus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do ye handle, brethren, with an inward handling?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span> When he had said this,<br/>
					a certain brother spake thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, Lord, handled with an inward handling."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now how, brother, do you handle<br/>
					with an inward handling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that brother answered,<br/>
					but thereby did not win over the heart of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus said,<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time, Exalted One,<br/>
					now is the time, Blessed One,<br/>
					for the Exalted One to speak of the inward handling,<br/>
					when they have heard the Exalted One,<br/>
					the brethren will bear it in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda,<br/>
					do ye listen,<br/>
					give your mind thoroughly<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/>
					responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this religion, brethren,<br/>
					a brother handling<br/>
					handles the inward handling:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This various, manifold suffering<br/>
					that arises in the world<br/>
					which is decay-and-death: -<br/>

					what is its cause?</p>

					<p class="f4">What being does decay-and-death come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">What not being does decay-and-death not come to be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He handling knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This various, manifold suffering<br/>
					that arises in the world<br/>
					which is decay-and-death: -<br/>
					this suffering has substance<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> as its basis,<br/>
					has substance as its uprising,<br/>
					has substance as its source,<br/>
					has substance as its cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is substance,<br/>
					there decay-and-death comes to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where substance is not,<br/>
					decay-and-death comes not to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows decay-and-death,<br/>
					its uprising<br/>
					and its ceasing,<br/>
					and he knows the way that is meet<br/>
					for going to the ceasing of decay-and-death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus practising he becomes one<br/>
					who walks according to the doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him, brethren, we call a brother who practises <span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span> rightly<br/>
					for the entire destruction of suffering,<br/>

					he handles the inward handling:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This substance<br/>

					<p class="f4">What being does substance come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">What not being does it not come to be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He rightly handling knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Substance has craving as its basis,<br/>
					has craving as its uprising,<br/>
					has craving as its source,<br/>
					has craving as its cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is craving,<br/>
					there substance comes to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where craving is not,<br/>
					substance comes not to be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows substance,<br/>
					its uprising,<br/>
					and its ceasing,<br/>
					and he knows the way that is meet<br/>
					for going to the ceasing of substance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus practising<br/>
					he becomes one who walks according to the doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him, brethren, we call a brother who practises rightly<br/>
					for the entire right extinction of suffering,<br/>
					for the ceasing of substance.</p>

					where when it arises<br/>
					does it arise?</p>

					<p class="f4">Where when it settles<br/>
					does it settle?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He in handling comes to know this: -</p>
