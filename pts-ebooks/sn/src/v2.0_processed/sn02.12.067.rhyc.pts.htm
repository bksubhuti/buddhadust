					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta and the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita were once staying at Benares,<br/>
					in Isipatana,<br/>
					in Antelope Wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Maha-Koṭṭhita arose at eventide from meditation<br/>
					and came into the presence of the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exchanging friendly greetings with him<br/>
					and the compliments of courtesy,<br/>
					he sat down at one side.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					he said to the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					old age-and-death,<br/>
					is it wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					in a different person,<br/>
					in one who is both same and different,<br/>
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					is it [a state] that arises by chance?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[80]</b></span> "Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					is [the case with] old age-and-death;<br/>
					but old age-and-death is conditioned by birth."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					is birth wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					in a different person,<br/>
					in one who is both same and different,<br/>
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/>
					is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					is birth,<br/>
					but birth is conditioned by becoming."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					is becoming wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					in a different person,<br/>
					in one who is both same and different,<br/>
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/>
					is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					is becoming,<br/>
					but becoming is conditioned by grasping."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					is grasping wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					in a different person,<br/>
					in one who is both same and different,<br/>
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/>
					is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					is grasping,<br/>
					but grasping is conditioned by craving."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					is craving wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					in a different person,<br/>
					in one who is both same and different,<br/>
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/>
					is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					is craving,<br/>
					but craving is conditioned by feeling."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					is feeling wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					in a different person,<br/>
					in one who is both same and different,<br/>
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/>
					is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					is feeling,<br/>
					but feeling is conditioned by contact."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					is contact wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					in a different person,<br/>
					in one who is both same and different,<br/>
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/>
					is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					is contact,<br/>
					but contact is conditioned by sense."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					is name-and-shape wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					in a different person,<br/>
					in one who is both same and different,<br/>
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/>
					is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					is name-and-shape,<br/>
					but sense is conditioned by name-and-shape."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					is name-and-shape wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					in a different person,<br/>
					in one who is both same and different,<br/>
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/>
					is it a state that arises by chance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					is name-and-shape,<br/>
					but name-and-shape is conditioned by consciousness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					is consciousness wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					in a different person,<br/>
					in one who is both same and different,<br/>
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/>
					is it [a state] that has arisen by chance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					is consciousness,<br/>
					but consciousness is conditioned by name-and-shape."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lo! now we understand the venerable Sāriputta's words thus: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Neither name-and-shape,<br/>
					nor consciousness<br/>
					is any one of these four:<br/>
					wrought in one and the same person,<br/>
					wrought in a different person,<br/>
					wrought by one who is both,<br/>
					wrought by one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br/>
					but arisen by chance;<br/>
					moreover name-and-shape<br/>
					is conditioned by consciousness,<br/>
					consciousness is conditioned by name-and-shape.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					is the meaning of what you have said to be regarded?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, I will make you a simile,<br/>
					for through a simile<br/>
					some intelligent men<br/>
					admit the meaning of what has been said.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if, friend,<br/>
					there stood two sheaves of reeds<br/>
					leaning one against the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, friend, name-and-shape<br/>
					comes to pass conditioned <span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span> by consciousness,<br/>
					consciousness conditioned by name-and-shape,<br/>
					sense conditioned by name-and-shape,<br/>
					contact is conditioned by sense,<br/>
					feeling is conditioned by contact,<br/>
					craving is conditioned by feeling,<br/>
					grasping is conditioned by craving,<br/>
					becoming is conditioned by grasping,<br/>
					birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even such is the uprising<br/>
					of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, friend, I were to pull towards me one of those sheaves of reeds,<br/>
					the other would fall;<br/>
					if I were to pull towards me the other,<br/>
					the former would fall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, friend, from the ceasing of name-and-shape,<br/>
					consciousness ceases;<br/>
					from the ceasing of consciousness,<br/>
					name-and-shape ceases;<br/>
					from the ceasing of name-and-shape<br/>
					sense ceases,<br/>
					from the ceasing of sense,<br/>
					contact ceases,<br/>
					from the ceasing of contact,<br/>
					craving ceases,<br/>
					from the ceasing of craving,<br/>
					feeling ceases,<br/>
					from the ceasing of feeling,<br/>
					grasping ceases,<br/>
					from the ceasing of grasping,<br/>
					becoming ceases,<br/>
					from the ceasing of becoming,<br/>
					birth ceases,<br/>
					even such is the ceasing,<br/>
					of this entire mass of ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, friend Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous, friend Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">How well is this uttered by the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					and for this that has been uttered by him<br/>
					with these thirty-six bases we thank him."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The Maha-vedalla Sutta of the Majjhima (No. 43) is another dialogue between these two eminent Teachers. Both, I incline to think, were compiled rather as 'lessons' for learners than as genuine inquiries by Koṭṭhita. He would not have ranked as a leading Thera, had he needed instruction on any one of the points raised. <i>Cf.</i> the 'we' for 'I,' p. 80. See my <i>Buddhist Psychology</i> (Quest), p. 52 f.</p>

It is included but similarly abridged in the PTS Pali.</p>
