						<p>"Now here, venerable ones,<br/>
						is both your replying<br/>
						and your non-attainment of these things?"</p>

						<p>"There is none, friend."</p>

						<p>"How is that?"</p>

						<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<hr />

						<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<p>Where the BJT and CSCD have:</p>

						<p><i>"Ettha dāni āyasmanto,<br/>
						idañ ca veyyā-karaṇaṃ imesañ ca dhammānaṃ asamāpatti.</i>|| ||</p>

						<p><i>Idaṃ no āvuso kathan" ti?</i>|| ||</p>

						<p>Translated by Bhk. Thanissaro as:</p>

						<p>"So just now, friends, didn't you make that declaration without having attained any of these Dhammas?"</p>

						<p>And translated by Bhk. Bodhi as:</p>

						<p>"Here now, venerable ones: this answer and the nonattainment of those states, how could this be, friends?"</p>

						<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<hr />

						<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p>I suggest that what is the case here is that the fragment present in the S<sup>I.3</sup> manuscript represents what was an abridgment where Susīmaā is to repeat the entire series of questions and answers: When asked X you responded Y. Then to be followed with: How is this to be understood, that you claim  that you have attained <i>añña</i> but you deny you have attained these things? This would follow the practice found in many other cases in the suttas. This form needs to be followed also in the conclusion made by Gotama below.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now here, venerable ones,<br/>
					is both your replying<br/>
					and your non-attainment of these things?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is none, friend.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span> We have been freed by insight,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> friend Susīma.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not know fully<br/>
					the matter stated concisely by the venerable ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be well if the venerable ones<br/>
					were to state it so that I might come to know fully<br/>
					the matter they have stated concisely."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whether you know it, friend Susīma,<br/>
					or whether you do not know it,<br/>
					we have been freed by insight."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Susīma rising from his seat<br/>
					went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/>
					and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Susīma so far as he had conversed with those brethren<br/>
					told all to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"First, Susīma, [comes] knowledge of the law of cause [and effect],<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					afterwards [comes] knowledge about Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not know fully<br/>
					this matter stated concisely by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be well, lord,<br/>
					if the Exalted One were to state it<br/>
					so that I might come to know fully<br/>
					the matter he has stated concisely."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whether you come to know it, Susīma,<br/>
					or whether you do not,<br/>
					first comes knowledge of the law of cause [and effect],<br/>
					afterwards comes knowledge about <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, Susīma?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the body<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent, is it painful or pleasant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Painful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/>
					painful,<br/>
					changeable by nature,<br/>
					do we well to contemplate it as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine,<br/>
					I am it,<br/>
					it is my spirit'?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span> "Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is not the same true of feeling,</p>

					<p class="f4">of perception,</p>

					<p class="f4">of activities,</p>

					<p class="f4">of consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore, Susīma, whatsoever body,<br/>
					past,<br/>
					future<br/>
					or present,<br/>
					internal or external,<br/>
					coarse or fine,<br/>
					mean or lofty,<br/>
					far or near -<br/>
					of all body to say it is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my spirit: -<br/>
					so is this to be regarded by right insight<br/>
					as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so too are feeling,</p>

					<p class="f4">perception,</p>

					<p class="f4">activities,</p>

					<p class="f4">consciousness to be regarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">So beholding, Susīma,<br/>
					the well taught Ariyan disciple feels repulsion at body,<br/>
					feeling,<br/>
					perception,<br/>
					activities,<br/>
					consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling repulsion he is not attracted by them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unattracted he is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge comes to him freed as to being freed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
					and he knows that birth is perished,<br/>
					that the divine life is lived,<br/>
					done is what was to be done;<br/>
					there is nothing further of these conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Old age and dying are conditioned by birth:</p>

					<p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Birth is conditioned by becoming:</p>

					<p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Becoming is conditioned by grasping:</p>

					<p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Grasping is conditioned by craving . . .</p>

					<p class="f4">craving by feeling . . .</p>

					<p class="f4">feeling by contact . . .</p>

					<p class="f4">contact by sense . . .</p>

					<p class="f4">sense by name-and-shape . . .</p>

					<p class="f4">name-and-shape by consciousness . . .</p>

					<p class="f4">consciousness by activities . . .</p>

					<p class="f4">activities by ignorance:</p>

					<p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When birth ceases, old age-and-death ceases:</p>

					<p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When becoming ceases, birth ceases:</p>

					<p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[90]</b></span> "When grasping ceases becoming ceases;<br/>
					when craving ceases, grasping ceases;<br/>
					when feeling ceases, craving ceases;<br/>
					when contact ceases, feeling ceases;<br/>
					when sense ceases, contact ceases;<br/>
					when name-and-shape ceases, sense ceases;<br/>
					when consciousness ceases, name-and-shape ceases;<br/>
					when activities cease, consciousness ceases;<br/>
					when ignorance ceases, activities cease:</p>

					<p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then surely, thou, Susīma, thus knowing, thus seeing, dost enjoy divers mystic powers:</p>

					<p class="f4">being one thou canst become many;<br/>
					being many thou canst become one;<br/>
					thou goest here visible<br/>
					there invisible<br/>
					without let or hindrance<br/>
					through wall,<br/>
					through rampart,<br/>
					through hill<br/>
					as if through air;<br/>
					thou divest into earth<br/>
					and up again<br/>
					as if in water;<br/>
					thou walkest on water<br/>
					without cleaving it as if on earth;<br/>
					thou travellest seated cross-legged through air<br/>
					as if thou wert a bird on the wing;<br/>
					thou canst handle and stroke with the hand<br/>
					this moon and sun,<br/>
					mighty and powerful though they be,<br/>
					yea, even to Brahmaworld canst thou dispose of thyself<br/>
					in the body?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then surely, Susīma, thus knowing thus seeing,<br/>
					thou canst hear,<br/>
					with pure deva-hearing passing that of men,<br/>
					sounds divine and human,<br/>
					be they remote or near?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then surely, Susīma, thus knowing thus seeing,<br/>
					thou canst understand with thy mind<br/>
					the mind of other beings,<br/>
					other persons,<br/>
					so that thou knowest the character of their thought?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then surely, Susīma, thus knowing thus seeing,<br/>
					thou canst remember divers former lives,<br/>
					even one birth or many,<br/>
					in circumstance and detail?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then surely, Susīma, thus knowing thus seeing,<br/>
					with pure deva-vision passing that of men<br/>
					thou canst behold beings as they go according to their deeds,<br/>
					deceasing,<br/>
					re-arising?" <span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then surely, Susīma, thus knowing thus seeing,<br/>
					thou attaining by volition<br/>
					canst dwell in those stages of deliverance<br/>
					where the Rüpa-world is transcended<br/>
					and the Immaterial [world is reached]?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here then, Susīma:</p>

					<p class="f4">This catechism and the non-attainment of these things:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span> —<br/>
					this is what we have done."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Susīma<br/>
					falling prone at the feet of the Exalted One<br/>
					spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Transgression, lord, hath caused me,<br/>
					so foolish,<br/>
					so stupid,<br/>
					so wrong am I,<br/>
					to transgress.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have gained admission<br/>
					as a thief of the Norm<br/>
					into this Norm and Discipline<br/>
					so well set forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One, lord,<br/>
					accept this my confession<br/>
					for my restraining myself in future."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, Susīma, transgression hath caused thee,<br/>
					so foolish,<br/>
					so stupid,<br/>
					so wrong art thou,<br/>
					to transgress,<br/>
					who didst gain admission<br/>
					as a thief of the Norm<br/>
					into this Norm and Discipline<br/>
					so well set forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, Susīma,<br/>
					they had caught a robber,<br/>
					an evildoer,<br/>
					and showed him to the prince saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sire, this is a robber, an evildoer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Inflict on him what penalty you wish.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the prince were to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go, men, bind this man's arms behind him with a strong rope,<br/>
					shave him bald,<br/>
					lead him around in a tumbril<br/>
					with a tam-tam<br/>
					from street to street,<br/>
					from crossroads to crossroads,<br/>
					and take him out by the south gate<br/>
					and at the south of the city<br/>
					cut off his head.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the princes' men were to do even as they were told.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, Susīma?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not that man in consequence<br/>
					experience woe and sorrow?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whether he experienced woe and sorrow or not,<br/>
					would not the gaining admission<br/>
					as a thief of doctrine<br/>
					into a Norm and <span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span> Discipline so well set forth<br/>
					have still more woeful<br/>
					and still bitterer results,<br/>
					yea, conduce to downfall hereafter?</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as thou, Susīma, hast seen thy transgression as transgression<br/>
					and hast made confession as is right,<br/>
					we do accept this from thee.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this, Susīma, it is to grow in the Ariyan discipline,<br/>
					when having seen our transgression as transgression<br/>
					we make confession as is right<br/>
					and in future practise self-restraint."</p>
