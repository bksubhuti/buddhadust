					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvathi at the Jeta's Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One took up<br/>
					a little pinch of dust<br/>
					on the tip of his finger-nail<br/>
					and said to the brethren: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"What think ye, brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether is this pinch of dust<br/>
					that I have taken up on my finger-nail<br/>
					the greater,<br/>
					or the mighty earth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The latter, lord, the mighty earth is the greater.</p>

					<p class="f4">Infinitely small is this pinch of dust<br/>
					taken up by the Exalted One on his finger-nail,<br/>
					not by a hundredth part,<br/>
					nor by a thousandth part,<br/>
					not by a hundred thousandth part<br/>
					does it equal the mighty earth<br/>
					when set beside it<br/>
					— this pinch of dust<br/>
					taken up by the Exalted One<br/>
					on his finger-nail."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brethren,<br/>
					for the Ariyan disciple who has won vision,<br/>
					for the person who has understanding<br/>
					this is the greater ill, to wit,<br/>
					that which for him is wholly perished,<br/>
					wholly finished;<br/>
					little is the ill that remains,<br/>
					not worth the hundredth part,<br/>
					not worth the thousandth part,<br/>
					not worth the hundred thousandth part<br/>
					when measured with the former ill<br/>
					which for him is wholly perished,<br/>
					wholly finished,<br/>
					to wit, a term of seven times.<sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></p>

					<p class="f4">So great in good, brethren,<br/>
					is it to be wise in the Norm;<br/>
					so great in good is it<br/>
					to have gained the eye of the Norm."</p>
