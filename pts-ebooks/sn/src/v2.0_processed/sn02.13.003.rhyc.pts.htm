					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren, that where those great rivers flow together,<br/>
					meet together, to wit,<br/>
					Gangā,<br/>
					Yamunā,<br/>
					Aciravatī,<br/>
					Sarabhū,<br/>
					Mahī,<br/>
					a man should therefrom<br/>
					draw out two or three drops of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the greater:<br/>
					those two or three drops of water brought up,<br/>
					or the water that has flowed together?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just this, lord, is greater,<br/>
					even the water that has flowed together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Scant are the two or three drops of water brought up,<br/>
					not equal to the hundredth part,<br/>
					the thousandth,<br/>
					the hundred thousandth part<br/>
					when compared with the water that has flowed together<br/>
					are those two or three drops of water."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brethren,<br/>
					for the Ariyan disciple who has won vision,<br/>
					for the person who has understanding<br/>
					this is the greater ill, to wit,<br/>
					that which for him is wholly perished,<br/>
					wholly finished;<br/>
					little is the ill that remains,<br/>
					not worth the hundredth part,<br/>
					not worth the thousandth part,<br/>
					not worth the hundred thousandth part<br/>
					when measured with the former ill<br/>
					which for him is wholly perished,<br/>
					wholly finished,<br/>
					to wit, a term of seven times.</p>

					<p class="f4">So great in good, brethren,<br/>
					is it to be wise in the Norm;<br/>
					so great in good is it<br/>
					to have gained the eye of the Norm."</p>
