					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren, that the sea were to come to extinction,<br/>
					to an end<br/>
					except for two or three drops<br/>
					of water brought from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren,<br/>
					which is more?</p>

					<p class="f4">The water in the sea<br/>
					or the two or three surviving drops of water?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just that is more, lord,<br/>
					even the water in the sea<br/>
					that has come to extinction,<br/>
					to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Scanty are the two or three surviving drops.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not make up one hundredth,<br/>
					one thousandth,<br/>
					one hundred thousandth part<br/>
					when compared with the sea that has come to extinction,<br/>
					to an end -<br/>
					those two or three drops."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brethren,<br/>
					for the Ariyan disciple who has won vision,<br/>
					for the person who has understanding<br/>
					this is the greater ill, to wit,<br/>
					that which for him is wholly perished,<br/>
					wholly finished;<br/>
					little is the ill that remains,<br/>
					not worth the hundredth part,<br/>
					not worth the thousandth part,<br/>
					not worth the hundred thousandth part<br/>
					when measured with the former ill<br/>
					which for him is wholly perished,<br/>
					wholly finished,<br/>
					to wit, a term of seven times.</p>

					<p class="f4">So great in good, brethren,<br/>
					is it to be wise in the Norm;<br/>
					so great in good is it<br/>
					to have gained the eye of the Norm."</p>
