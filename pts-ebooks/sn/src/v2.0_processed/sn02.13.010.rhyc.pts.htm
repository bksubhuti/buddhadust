					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren, that Himalaya, lord of the hills,<br/>
					were to come to extinction,<br/>
					come to an end,<br/>
					save for seven surviving grains of gravel<br/>
					as large as mustard-seeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren, which is more?</p>

					<p class="f4">That Himalaya, lord of the hills,<br/>
					which has come to extinction,<br/>
					come to an end,<br/>
					or those seven surviving grains of gravel<br/>
					as large as mustard-seeds?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just that is more, lord, even Himalaya, lord of the hills.</p>

					<p class="f4">Small are the seven grains of gravel<br/>
					as large as mustard-seeds that survive.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not make up a hundredth,<br/>
					a thousandth,<br/>
					a hundred thousandth part<br/>
					when compared with Himalaya, lord of the hills -<br/>
					those seven grains of gravel laid together<br/>
					as large as mustard-seeds."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brethren,<br/>
					for the Ariyan disciple who has won vision,<br/>
					for the person who has understanding<br/>
					this is the greater ill, to wit,<br/>
					that which for him is wholly perished,<br/>
					wholly finished;<br/>
					little is the ill that remains,<br/>
					not worth the hundredth part,<br/>
					not worth the thousandth part,<br/>
					not worth the hundred thousandth part<br/>
					when measured with the former ill<br/>
					which for him is wholly perished,<br/>
					wholly finished,<br/>
					to wit, a term of seven times.</p>

					<p class="f4">So great in good, brethren,<br/>
					is it to be wise in the Norm;<br/>
					so great in good is it<br/>
					to have gained the eye of the Norm."</p>
