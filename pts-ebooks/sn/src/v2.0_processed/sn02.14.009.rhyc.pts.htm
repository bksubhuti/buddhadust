					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta's Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Because of the diversity in elements, brethren, arises diversity in perceptions,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					because of diversity in perceptions arises diversity in aims,<br/>
					because of diversity in aims arises diversity in desires,<br/>
					because of diversity in desires arises diversity in yearnings,<br/>
					because of diversity in yearnings arises diversity in quests,<br/>
					because of diversity in quests arises diversity in gains.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. What, brethren, is the diversity in elements?</p>

					<p class="f4">Visible object-element,<br/>
					sound-element,<br/>
					odour-element,<br/>
					taste-element,<br/>
					tangible-element,<br/>
					idea-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the diversity in elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. How is it that because of diversity in elements there arises diversity in perceptions,<br/>
					because of diversity in perceptions arises diversity in aims,<br/>
					because of diversity in aims arises diversity in desires,<br/>
					because of diversity in desires arises diversity in yearnings,<br/>
					because of diversity in yearnings arises diversity in quests,<br/>
					because of diversity in quests arises diversity in gains?</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Because of visible object-element, brethren, arises visible object-perception,<br/>
					because of visible object-perception arises visible object-aims,<br/>
					because of visible object-aims arises visible object-desires,<br/>
					because of visible object-desires arises visible object-yearnings,<br/>
					because of visible object-yearnings arises visible object-quests,<br/>
					because of visible object-quests arises visible object=gains.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Because of sound-element, brethren, arises sound-perception,<br/>
					because of sound-perception arises sound-aims,<br/>
					because of sound-aims arises sound-desires,<br/>
					because of sound-desires arises sound-yearnings,<br/>
					because of sound-yearnings arises sound-quests,<br/>
					because of sound-quests arises sound-gains.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Because of odour-element, brethren, arises odour-perception,<br/>
					because of odour-perception arises odour-aims,<br/>
					because of odour-aims arises odour-desires,<br/>
					because of odour-desires arises odour-yearnings,<br/>because of odour-yearnings arises odour-quests,<br/>
					because of odour-quests arises odour-gains.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Because of taste-element, brethren, arises taste-perception,<br/>
					because of taste-perception arises taste-aims,<br/>
					because of taste-aims arises taste-desires,<br/>
					because of taste-desires arises taste-yearnings,<br/>
					because of taste-yearnings arises taste-quests,<br/>
					because of taste-quests arises taste-gains.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Because of tangibles-element, brethren, arises tangibles-perception,<br/>
					because of tangibles-perception arises tangibles-aims,<br/>
					because of tangibles-aims arises tangibles-desires,<br/>
					because of tangibles-desires arises tangibles-yearnings,<br/>
					beause of tangibles-yearnings arises tangibles-quests,<br/>
					because of tangibles-quests arises tangibles-gains.</p>

					<p class="f4">10. Because of ideas-element, brethren, arises ideas-perception,<br/>
					because of ideas-perception arises ideas-aims,<br/>
					because of ideas-aims arises ideas-desires,<br/>
					because of ideas-desires arises ideas-yearnings,<br/>
					because of ideas-yearnings arises ideas-quests,<br/>
					because of ideas-quests arises ideas-gains.</p>

					<p class="f4">11. Thus it is that because of the diversity in elements, brethren, arises diversity in perceptions,<br/>
					because of diversity in perceptions arises diversity in aims,<br/>
					because of diversity in aims arises diversity in desires,<br/>
					because of diversity in desires arises diversity in yearnings,<br/>
					because of diversity in yearnings arises diversity in quests,<br/>
					because of diversity in quests arises diversity in gains."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> The translators conclude this section abbreviating: "hence diversity of aims, hence diversity of contact, hence diversity of feeling, hence diversity of desires, hence diversity of yearnings, hence diversity of quests, hence diversity of gains." and then conclude the sutta: "The diversity and the causal order are true of each element."</p>
