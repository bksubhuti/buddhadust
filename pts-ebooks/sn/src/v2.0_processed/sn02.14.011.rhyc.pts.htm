					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi<br/>
					at the Jeta's Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these seven elements, brethren — which seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The radiance-element,<br/>
					the beauty-element,<br/>
					the space-infinity- <span class="f2 g"><b>[105]</b></span> element,<br/>
					the consciousness-infinity-element,<br/>
					the nothingness-sphere-element,<br/>
					the neither perception-nor-non-perception-sphere-element,<br/>
					the perception-and-feeling-cessation-element<br/>
					— these are the seven.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When he had so said, a certain brother said this to him: —</p>

					<p class="f4">'Because of what, lord, are these seven elements revealed?'</p>

					<p class="f4">That radiance-element, brother, is revealed through darkness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That beauty-element is revealed through ugliness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That space-infinity-element is revealed through visible object.</p>

					<p class="f4">That consciousness-infinity-element is revealed through space-infinity-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">And similarly each of the remaining three is revealed through the element named previously.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, lord, can there be attainment<br/>
					of each of these seven elements?</p>

					<p class="f4">The radiance, beauty, space-infinity, consciousness-infinity-sphere and nothingness-sphere-elements are to be won by attainment in perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">The neither-perception-nor-non-perception-sphere-element is to be won by attainment in the remaning activities of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">The perception and feeling cessation-element is to be won by attainment of cessation.</p>
