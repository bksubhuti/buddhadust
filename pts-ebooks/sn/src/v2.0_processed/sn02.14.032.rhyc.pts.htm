					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the earth-element<br/>
					so that by insight<br/>
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the earth-element<br/>
					so that by insight<br/>
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br/>
					from the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br/>
					from the earth-element.<br/>
					so that by insight<br/>
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the water-element<br/>
					so that by insight<br/>
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the water-element<br/>
					so that by insight<br/>
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br/>
					from the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br/>
					from the water-element,<br/>
					so that by insight<br/>
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the heat-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the heat-element<br/>
					so that by insight<br/>
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the heat-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the heat-element<br/>
					so that by insight<br/>
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br/>
					from the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br/>
					from the heat-element,<br/>
					so that by insight<br/>
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the air-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the air-element<br/>
					so that by insight<br/>
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the air-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br/>
					that comes from the air-element<br/>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br/>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">So long as I, brethren,<br/>
					had not fully come to know<br/>
					even as it really is<br/>
					the satisfaction as such,<br/>
					the misery as such,<br/>
					the escape as such<br/>
					that there is in the four elements,<br/>
					so long did I not discern<br/>
					what it was to be enlightened<br/>
					with supreme enlightenment<br/>
					with regard to the world and its deities -<br/>
					its Maras,<br/>
					its Brahmas -<br/>
					and to the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I, brethren,<br/>
					had fully come to know<br/>
					even as it really is<br/>
					the satisfaction as such,<br/>
					the misery as such,<br/>
					the escape as such<br/>
					that there is in the four elements,<br/>
					then did I discern<br/>
					what it is to be enlightened<br/>
					with supreme enlightenment<br/>
					with regard to the world and its deities,<br/>
					its Maras,<br/>
					its Brahmas,<br/>
					and to the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">And knowledge, insight arose in me<br/>
					that sure is my emancipation of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the last birth!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is there no more rebecoming!'"</p>
