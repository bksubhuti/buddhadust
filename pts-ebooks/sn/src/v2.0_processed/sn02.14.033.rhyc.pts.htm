					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If there were not, brethren,<br/>
					this satisfaction that comes from the earth-element,<br/>
					beings would not lust after the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/>
					this satisfaction that comes from the earth-element,<br/>
					beings lust after the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it were not, brethren,<br/>
					that misery comes from the earth-element,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/>
					that misery comes from the earth-element,<br/>
					beings are repelled by the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it were not, brethren, that there is<br/>
					escape from the earth-element,<br/>
					beings could not escape from the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as that there is<br/>
					escape from the earth-element,<br/>
					beings do escape from the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"If there were not, brethren,<br/>
					this satisfaction that comes from the water-element,<br/>
					beings would not lust after the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/>
					this satisfaction that comes from the water-element,<br/>
					beings lust after the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it were not, brethren,<br/>
					that misery comes from the water-element,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"If there were not, brethren,<br/>
					this satisfaction that comes from the heat-element,<br/>
					beings would not lust after the heat-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/>
					this satisfaction that comes from the heat-element,<br/>
					beings lust after the heat-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it were not, brethren,<br/>
					that misery comes from the heat-element,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by the heat-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br/>
					that misery comes from the heat-element,<br/>
					beings are repelled by the heat-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it were not, brethren, that there is<br/>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as that there is<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"If there were not, brethren,<br/>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In so far, brethren, as beings<br/>
					have not fully come to know,<br/>
					even as it really is,<br/>
					the satisfaction as such,<br/>
					the misery as such,<br/>
					the escape as such<br/>
					in these four elements,<br/>
					they have not lived aloof,<br/>
					detached,<br/>
					separate,<br/>
					disassociated,<br/>
					with the barriers to the mind<br/>
					done away with,<br/>
					from the world and its deities -<br/>
					its Maras,<br/>
					its Brahmas -<br/>
					and from the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, brethren,<br/>
					beings have fully come to know,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the satisfaction as such,<br/>
					the misery as such,<br/>
					the escape as such<br/>
					in these four elements,<br/>
					then do beings live aloof,<br/>
