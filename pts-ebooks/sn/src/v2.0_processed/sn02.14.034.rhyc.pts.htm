					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If this earth-element, brethren,<br/>
					were entirely painful,<br/>
					beset with pain,<br/>
					immersed in pain,<br/>
					not immersed in happiness,<br/>
					beings would not be lusting after the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as this earth-element, brethren,<br/>
