					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these four elements, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Earth-element,<br/>
					water-element,<br/>
					heat-element,<br/>
					air-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, any recluses or brahmins whatever<br/>
					who do not understand,<br/>
					even as it really is,<br/>
					the satisfaction,<br/>
					the misery,<br/>
					the escape<br/>
					with regard to these four elements,<br/>
					they for me<br/>
					are not approved of among recluses as recluses<br/>
					nor among brahmins as brahmins,<br/>
					nor have those venerable ones<br/>
					come even in this life<br/>
					fully to know of themselves,<br/>
					to realize,<br/>
					to live<br/>
					in the attainment of,<br/>
					the good of<br/>
					being recluse or brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">But any recluses or brahmins whatever<br/>
					who do understand,<br/>
					even as it really is,<br/>
					the satisfaction,<br/>
					the misery,<br/>
					the escape<br/>
					with regard to these four elements,<br/>
					they for me<br/>
					are approved of among recluses as recluses<br/>
					or among brahmins as brahmins,<br/>
