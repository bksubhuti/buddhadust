					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br/>
					of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/>
					of the running on, the faring on,<br/>
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/>
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man, brethren,<br/>
					were to make this great earth<br/>
					into clay balls<br/>
					each the size only of a kola kernel<br/>
					and laid them down saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is my father,<br/>
					this is my father's father.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, this great earth would be used up,<br/>
					ended<br/>
					or ever the fathers of that man's father<br/>
					were come to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/>
					of the faring on, running on,<br/>
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/>
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many a day, brethren,<br/>
					have ye been suffering ill,<br/>
					have ye been suffering pain,<br/>
					have ye been suffering disaster,<br/>
					have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/>
					for you to be repelled<br/>
					by all the things of this world,<br/>
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br/>
					enough to be delivered therefrom."</p>
