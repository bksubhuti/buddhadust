					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br/>
					of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/>
					of the running on, the faring on,<br/>
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/>
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that what think ye brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is greater:</p>

					<p class="f4">- the mother's milk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					that ye have drunk<br/>
					as ye have fared on,<br/>
					run on this long while,<br/>
					or the water in the four seas?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As we allow, lord,<br/>
					that we have been taught by the Exalted One,<br/>
					it is this, lord, that is greater:<br/>
					the mother's milk drunk by us<br/>
					as we have fared on,<br/>
					run on this long while,<br/>
					and not the water in the four seas."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, brethren!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well do ye allow that<br/>
					so has the doctrine been taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly the mother's milk that ye have drunk<br/>
					as ye have fared on,<br/>
					run on this long while is greater,<br/>
					and not the water in the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br/>
					of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/>
					of the faring on, running on,<br/>
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/>
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many a day, brethren,<br/>
					have ye been suffering ill,<br/>
					have ye been suffering pain,<br/>
					have ye been suffering disaster,<br/>
					have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/>
					for you to be repelled<br/>
					by all the things of this world,<br/>
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br/>
					enough to be delivered therefrom."</p>
