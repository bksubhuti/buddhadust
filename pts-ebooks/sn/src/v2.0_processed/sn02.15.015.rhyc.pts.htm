					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br/>
					of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/>
					of the running on,<br/>
					the faring on<br/>
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br/>
					tied by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not an easy thing is it, brethren,<br/>
					to find a being<br/>
					who during this long many-a-day<br/>
					has not at one time been a father.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br/>
					of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br/>
					of beings running on,<br/>
					faring on,<br/>
					cloaked in ignorance,<br/>
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many a day, brethren,<br/>
					have ye been suffering ill,<br/>
					have ye been suffering pain,<br/>
					have ye been suffering disaster,<br/>
					have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br/>
					for you to be repelled<br/>
					by all the things of this world,<br/>
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br/>
					enough to be delivered therefrom."</p>
