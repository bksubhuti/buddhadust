					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What think ye as to this, brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">What manner of brother is worthy,<br/>
					and what manner of brother is unworthy<br/>
					to go among the families?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root,<br/>
					their guide,<br/>
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br/>
					if the meaning of this that he has spoken<br/>
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/>
					the brethren will bear it in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, brethren, listen,<br/>
					give your mind thoroughly,<br/>
					I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br/>
					they responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, brethren, if a brother go among the families with such a mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let them only give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them not refuse to give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me abundantly,<br/>
					not scantily!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them give me excellent things only,<br/>
					not poor things!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give quickly,<br/>
					not tardily!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me respectfully,<br/>
					not disrespectfully!'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, going among the families<br/>
					with such thoughts,<br/>
					if they give not,<br/>
					is vexed,<br/>
					and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, going among the families<br/>
					with such thoughts,<br/>
					if they give scantily,<br/>
					is vexed,<br/>
					and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, going among the families<br/>
					with such thoughts,<br/>
					if they give poor things,<br/>
					is vexed,<br/>
					and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, going among the families<br/>
					with such thoughts,<br/>
					if they give tardily,<br/>
					is vexed,<br/>
					and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, going among the families<br/>
					with such thoughts,<br/>
					if they give disrespectfully,<br/>
					is vexed,<br/>
					and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">This manner of brother<br/>
					is unworthy to go among the families.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But that brother who goes among the families<br/>
					with such a mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How could I possibly think<br/>
					on this occasion<br/>
					with regard to others,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let them only give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them not refuse to give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me abundantly,<br/>
					not scantily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me excellent things,<br/>
					not poor things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me quickly,<br/>
					not tardily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me respectfully,<br/>
					not disrespectfully!"'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give not,<br/>
					is not vexed,<br/>
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, if they give scantily,<br/>
					is not vexed,<br/>
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give poor things,<br/>
					is not vexed,<br/>
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give tardily,<br/>
					is not vexed,<br/>
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give disrespectfully,<br/>
					is not vexed,<br/>
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a manner of brother<br/>
					is worthy to go among the families.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Kassapa, brethren, is of such a mind<br/>
					as he goes among the families:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How could I possibly think<br/>
					on this occasion<br/>
					with regard to others:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let them only give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them not refuse to give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me abundantly,<br/>
					not scantily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me excellent things,<br/>
					not poor things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me quickly,<br/>
					not tardily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me respectfully,<br/>
					not disrespectfully!"'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give not,<br/>
					is not vexed,<br/>
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, if they give scantily,<br/>
					is not vexed,<br/>
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give poor things,<br/>
					is not vexed,<br/>
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give tardily,<br/>
					is not vexed,<br/>
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give disrespectfully,<br/>
					is not vexed,<br/>
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a manner of brother<br/>
					is worthy to go among the families.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, brethren, by <span class="f2 g"><b>[136]</b></span> Kassapa will I exhort you,<br/>
					or by one like Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">By them exhorted<br/>
					ye are to practise<br/>
					that ye may so attain."</p>
