					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard: —</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Kassapa went into his presence,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the venerable Maha-Kassapa said this to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, lord, are the conditions,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					that formerly there were both fewer precepts<br/>
					and more brethren were established as Arahants?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What, lord, are the condi- <span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span> tions,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					that now-a-days there are more precepts<br/>
					and fewer brethren are established as Arahants?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It happens thus, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">When members<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> decrease,<br/>
					and the true doctrine disappears,<br/>
					there are then more precepts,<br/>
					and few brethren are established as Arahants.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no disappearing of the true doctrine, Kassapa,<br/>
					till a counterfeit doctrine arises in the world;<br/>
					but when a counterfeit doctrine does arise,<br/>
					then there is a disappearance of the true doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as there is no disappearing of gold<br/>
					so long as there is no counterfeit gold arisen in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is with the true doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earth-element, Kassapa, does not make the true doctrine disappear,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					nor does the water-element,<br/>
					nor the heat-element,<br/>
					nor the air-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But here in the Order itself futile<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> men arise,<br/>
					and it is they who make the true doctrine disappear.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the sinking of a ship, Kassapa,<br/>
					by overlading:<br/>
					it is not thus that the true doctrine disappears.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are five lowering things<br/>
					that conduce to the obscuration and disappearance<br/>
					of the true doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is when brethren and sisters,<br/>
					laymen and laywomen<br/>
					live in irreverence and are unruly toward the Teacher,<br/>
					live in irreverence and are unruly toward the Norm,<br/>
					live in irreverence and are unruly toward the Order,<br/>
					live in irreverence and are unruly toward the training,<br/>
					live in irreverence and are unruly toward concentrative study.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when they live in reverence and docility toward these Five,<br/>
					then do these five things conduce to the maintenance,<br/>
					the clarity,<br/>
					the presence of the true doctrine."</p>
