					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Rāhula came into the presence of the Exalted One, saluted him and eat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Rāhula said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One were to teach me a doctrine which,<br/>
					having heard,<br/>
					I might live alone,<br/>
					secluded,<br/>
					zealous,<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					and aspiring."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What think you as to this, Rāhula?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is visual awareness abiding or fleeting?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Fleeting, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/>
					is it happy or unhappy?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Unhappy, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/>
					unhappy,<br/>
					changeable -<br/>
					is it fit to consider that as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine!</p>

					<p class="f4">This am I!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my spirit?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is ear-awareness<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> abiding or fleeting?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is fleeting,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"So seeing, Rāhula,<br/>
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is repelled by sight,<br/>
					is repelled by hearing,<br/>
					is repelled by smelling,<br/>
					is repelled by tast,<br/>
					is repelled by touch,<br/>
					is repelled by mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled,<br/>
					he loses desire for it;<br/>
					from losing desire<br/>
					he is set free;<br/>
					concerning that which is free,<br/>
					knowledge comes to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am free!</p>

					<p class="f4">Perished is birth,<br/>
					lived is the divine life,<br/>
					done what was to be done,<br/>
					there is nothing more in this state!' -<br/>
					thus he knows."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Mrs. Rhys Davids abridges after 'is visual awareness'. Following that the result would be 'auditory, nasal, gustatory, tactile, mental', etc. But the Pali is 'eye-consciousness (or her 'awareness'), ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, mind-' which I have used in the following.</p>
