					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Rājagaha<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove<br/>
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Lakkhana<br/>
					and the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/>
					were staying at Vulture's Peak hill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/>
					rising at an early hour<br/>
					and taking bowl and robe<br/>
					went to see the venerable Lakkhana<br/>
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let us go, friend Lakkhana,<br/>
					and enter Rājagaha for alms."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Lakkhana consented.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/>
					as he was descending the hill<br/>
					and passing a certain place<br/>
					smiled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Lakkhana said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the reason,<br/>
					what is the cause, friend Moggallāna,<br/>
					that you smile?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not the right time for that question, friend Lakkhana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me the question in the Exalted One's presence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the twain had made their alms-round in Rājagaha,<br/>
					had dined<br/>
					and come away from their meal,<br/>
					they went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and took their seat beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					the venerable Lakkhana said to Mahā-Moggallāna:-</p>

					<p class="f4">"As the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna was descending Vulture's Peak hill just now,<br/>
					came to a certain place<br/>
					he smiled:-</p>

					<p class="f4">What was the reason,<br/>
					what was the cause for the smile?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, friend,<br/>
					as I was descending Vulture's Peak hill,<br/>
					I saw a headless trunk of a man going through the air;<br/>
					his eyes wereon his chest<br/>
					and vultures,<br/>
					crows<br/>
					and falcons<br/>
					kept flying after it,<br/>
					pecking at its ribs,<br/>
					pulling it apart<br/>
					while it uttered cries of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, friend, came this thought:-</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 but this is wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">0 but this is marvellous<br/>
					that a person will come to have such a shape,<br/>
					that the individuality acquired<br/>
					will come to have such a shape!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Disciples, brethren, live the life of vision,<br/>
					yea, of insight,<br/>
					since a disciple will know,<br/>
					or will see,<br/>
					or will testify<br/>
					to a thing like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">I also, brethren, had seen that being before now,<br/>
					yet I did not reveal it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I might have revealed it,<br/>
					and others would not have believed me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had they not believed me,<br/>
					it would have been to their hurt and their sorrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">'That being, brethren,<br/>
					was a bandit named Hārika<br/>
					in this very Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He by the effect of that work<br/>
					has been punished for many years,<br/>
					for many hundreds,<br/>
					nay, hundred thousands of years<br/>
					in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now by the remaining effect of that work<br/>
					he has acquired a personality<br/>
					of that kind."</p>
