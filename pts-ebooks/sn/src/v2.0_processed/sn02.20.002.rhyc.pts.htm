					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, lifting up a little sand on the tip of his finger-nail, addressed the	brethren:-</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this what think ye, brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is greater,<br/>
					this little sand lifted on my finger-nail,<br/>
					or this great earth?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[176]</b></span> "This lord, is greater,<br/>
					even this great earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">A trifle is the little sand<br/>
					lifted by the Exalted One on to his finger-nail.</p>

					<p class="f4">It cannot come into reckoning,<br/>
					it cannot come into comparison,<br/>
					it cannot form a fraction<br/>
					when compared with the great earth —<br/>
					this little sand lifted by the Exalted One on to his finger-nail."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brethren,<br/>
					are the beings that are reborn among humans<br/>
					few in number as against the greater number<br/>
					that are reborn elsewhere<br/>
					and not among humans.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren,<br/>
					thus must ye train yourselves:­</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will live earnestly'<br/>
					- even thus."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Somewhat arbitrarily the commentarial tradition judges that the greater alternative includes only rebirth in the four woeful spheres: — purgatory, animals, asuras and petas, deva-rebirth being included under the former alternative.</p>
