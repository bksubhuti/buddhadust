					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as whatever clans have many women,<br/>
					few men,<br/>
					are easily molested by robbers and pot-thieves,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					even so, brethren,<br/>
					any brother who has not developed<br/>
					and often practised<br/>
					liberation of will through love<br/>
					is easily molested by beings other than human.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as whatever clans have few women,<br/>
					many men,<br/>
					are hard to molest by robbers and pot-thieves,<br/>
					even so any brother who has developed<br/>
					and often practised<br/>
					liberation of will through love<br/>
					is hardly molested by beings other than human.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren, thus must ye train yourselves:­</p>

					<p class="f4">Liberation of the will through love we will develop,<br/>
					we will often practise it,<br/>
					make it a vehicle,<br/>
					make it a base,<br/>
					take our stand upon it,<br/>
					store it up,<br/>
					thoroughly set it going."</p>
