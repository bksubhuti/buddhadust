					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the brethren: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren, there were four archers<br/>
					mighty with the bow,<br/>
					well trained,<br/>
					expert,<br/>
					past masters in their art<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					standing one at each quarter,<br/>
					and a man were to come saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will catch and bring<br/>
					the shafts let fly by these four archers<br/>
					mighty with the bow,<br/>
					well trained,<br/>
					expert,<br/>
					past masters in their art<br/>
					standing one at each quarter<br/>
					or ever they reach the ground.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">Were this enough for him to be called<br/>
					a swift man<br/>
					possessed of supreme speed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even, lord, if he caught and brought<br/>
					the shafts let fly<br/>
					by only one of the four archers<br/>
					mighty with the bow,<br/>
					well trained,<br/>
					expert,<br/>
					past masters in their art<br/>
					standing one at each quarter<br/>
					or ever they reached the ground,<br/>
					it were enough for him to be called<br/>
					a swift man<br/>
					possessed of supreme speed.</p>

					<p class="f4">What need to speak of four such bowmen?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, as is the speed of that man,<br/>
					as is the speed of moon and sun,<br/>
					swifter than he,<br/>
					as is the speed of those spirits<br/>
					who run ahead<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of moon and sun<br/>
					swifter than he,<br/>
					swifter than them both,<br/>
					so swifter than even these<br/>
					is the passing away of the things of this life.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren, thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will live earnestly'" — even thus."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
