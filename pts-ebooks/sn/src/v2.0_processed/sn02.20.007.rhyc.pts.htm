					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the Exalted One addressed the brethren: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, brethren,<br/>
					the Dasārahas had a kettle­drum called Summoner.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As it began to split<br/>
					the Dasārahas fixed in ever another peg,<br/>
					until the time came<br/>
					that the Summoner's original drumhead<br/>
					had vanished<br/>
					and only the framework of pegs remained.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span> Even so, brethren,<br/>
					will the brethren become<br/>
					in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those Suttantas uttered by the Tathāgata,<br/>
					deep,<br/>
					deep in meaning,<br/>
					not of the world,<br/>
					dealing with the void,<br/>
					to these when uttered,<br/>
					they will not listen,<br/>
					they will not lend a ready ear,<br/>
					they will not bring to them<br/>
					an understanding heart,<br/>
					they will not deem those doctrines<br/>
					that which should be learnt by heart,<br/>
					that which should be mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">But those Suttantas<br/>
					which are made by poets,<br/>
					which are poetry,<br/>
					which are a manifold of words,<br/>
					a manifold of phrases,<br/>
					alien,<br/>
					the utterances of disciples,<br/>
					to these when uttered<br/>
					they will listen,<br/>
					they will lend a ready ear,<br/>
					they will bring an understanding heart,<br/>
					they will deem these doctrines<br/>
					that which should be learnt by heart,<br/>
					which should be mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, brethren,<br/>
					that the Suttantas uttered by the Tathāgata,<br/>
					deep,<br/>
					deep in meaning,<br/>
					not of the world,<br/>
					dealing with the void,<br/>
					will disappear.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren, ye are thus to train yourselves :-</p>

					<p class="f4">To these very Suttantas will we listen,<br/>
					will we give a ready ear,<br/>
					to these will we bring an understanding heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">And we will deem these doctrines<br/>
					that which should be learnt by heart,<br/>
					and mastered:<br/>
					- even thus.</p>

Summoning by drum is mentioned in <i>Jāt.</i> ii, 70 (No. 186); iv, 171 (No. 483), 256. On the name see <i>Jātaka</i> ii, p. 237 (No. 499) (No. 267), where the allusion looks like a gloss.</p>
