					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this time both the venerable ones<br/>
					Sāriputta and Mahā-Moggallāna<br/>
					were staying at Rājagaha<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove<br/>
					at the Suirrels' Feeding-ground<br/>
					in the same cell.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					rising at eventide from meditation<br/>
					went to the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/>
					and exchanged kind and friendly greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated by his side<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta said thus: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very serene, friend, Moggallāna,<br/>
					are you looking,<br/>
					very pure and clear<br/>
					is your complexion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Has the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/>
					spent to-day in peace?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"I spent to-day, friend,<br/>
					in the exercise of sense,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					moreover I had pious converse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"With whom did the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/>
					hold pious converse?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"With the Exalted One, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Far away, friend,<br/>
					the Exalted One now stays at Savatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove<br/>
					in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">What then?</p>

					<p class="f4">Did the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br/>
					go by will-power to the Exalted one,<br/>
					or was it the other way about?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I neither went by will-power<br/>
					to the Exalted One, friend,<br/>
					nor did the Exalted One<br/>
					come by will-power to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless<br/>
					even as with him,<br/>
					so also with me<br/>
					the deva-sight<br/>
					and the deva-hearing<br/>
					are made clear."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span> "What kind of pious converse<br/>
					did the Exalted One hold<br/>
					with the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to that, friend,<br/>
					I asked the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We say, lord,<br/>
					[this one] is of consummate energy,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					[that one] is of consummate energy;<br/>
					in wht way is a man so?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said to me this: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is herein, Moggallāna,<br/>
					that a brother practises consummate energy: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Verily let skin and sinews and bones<br/>
							wilt in my body,<br/>
							let flesh and blood dry up,<br/>
							or ever there be halting of energy<br/>
							till I have won<br/>
							that which by a man's strength,<br/>
							by man's energy,<br/>
							by man's progress<br/>
							may be won!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> —</p>

					<p class="f4">— thus Moggallāna, does one become of consummate energy.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It was just thus that I had pious converse with the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As if a little mound of gravel<br/>
					were set up alongside of Himālaya,<br/>
					lord of the hills, friend,<br/>
					even so are we<br/>
					when set up alongside of the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily may he,<br/>
					so gifted,<br/>
					so wonderful<br/>
					abide here for an aeon<br/>
					if he so desire!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As if a little pinch of salt<br/>
					were set up alongside of a big jar of salt, friend,<br/>
					even so are we<br/>
					when set up alongside of the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily hath the Exalted One praised,<br/>
					commended,<br/>
					extolled the venerable Sāriputta in divers ways.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Even as Sāriputta was supreme<br/>
					      In insight, morals, and self-mastery,<br/>
					      So may the brother who hath won the goal<br/>
					      Rank even with the highest of them all.'"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus verily did these two great souls<br/>
					give cheer one to the other<br/>
					in that they spoke well,<br/>
					in that they talked well.</p>
