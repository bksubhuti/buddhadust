					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a certain novice<br/>
					after he had returned from his almsround<br/>
					and had dined,<br/>
					entered his cell<br/>
					and sat at leisure,<br/>
					in silence and resigned,<br/>
					nor did he render service to the brethren<br/>
					at the time of robe-making.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of the brethren<br/>
					went and informed the Exalted One<br/>
					of his conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One bade a certain brother:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come thou, brother,<br/>
					bid that brother by my word hither<br/>
					saying, 'The Master bids thee, friend.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord," was the response,<br/>
					and that brother came,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One,<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him so seated the Exalted One said: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true what they say<br/>
					that thou, brother,<br/>
					after almsround and meal<br/>
					dost sit at leisure,<br/>
					in silence<br/>
					and resigned,<br/>
					nor renderest service<br/>
					to the brethren<br/>
					at the time of robe-making?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do my own work, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/>
					reading by his mind<br/>
					that brother's mind,<br/>
					bade the brethren: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be ye not vexed, brethren,<br/>
					with this brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a brother who can attain<br/>
					at will,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					who can attain<br/>
					without trouble,<br/>
					without toil<br/>
					the Four Jhānas,<br/>
					happy states,<br/>
					under present conditions,<br/>
					of highest consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And that for the sake of which<br/>
					the clansmen rightly leave home<br/>
					for the homeless —<br/>
					that uttermost goal of divine living<br/>
					he has comoe to know thoroughly for himself<br/>
					and to realize,<br/>
					has attained it<br/>
					and therein abides."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Wellfarer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">No slacker nor the man of puny strength<br/>
					      May win Nibbāna, freedom from all ill.<br/>
					      And this young brother, yea, this peerless man<br/>
					      Bears the last burden, devil's<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> conqueror.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
