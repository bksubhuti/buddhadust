					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sujāta<br/>
					came into the presence of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One saw the venerable Sujāta coming,<br/>
					and seeing him<br/>
					he addressed the brethren: —</p>

					<p class="f4">'Truly, brethren, that clansman<br/>
					in both ways is beautiful;<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span> not only in that he is gifted with berfect beauty,<br/>
					is very handsome, attractive and lovely,<br/>
					but also in that he has come<br/>
					to know thoroughly for himself<br/>
					and to realize,<br/>
					and so attain to<br/>
					and abide in<br/>
					that uttermost goal of devine living,<br/>
					for the sake of which<br/>
					the clansmen rightly leave home<br/>
					for the homeless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Wellfarer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Fair, I ween, this brother is.<br/>
					      Straight and sincere theheart of him.<br/>
					      Detached, unyoked [from worldly ties],<br/>
					      In grasing not O well is him!<br/>
					      He bears thefinal body now,<br/>
					      Victor o'er Māra and his mount.</p>
