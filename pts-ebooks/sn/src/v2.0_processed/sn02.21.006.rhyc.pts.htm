					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					came into thepresence of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One saw him coming,<br/>
					and seeinghim he addressed the brethren: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"See ye, brethren,<br/>
					this brother coming,<br/>
					ugly,<br/>
					unsightly,<br/>
					hunchbacked,<br/>
					dispised by the brethren?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"We do, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now that brother is highly gifted, brethren,<br/>
					of a lofty nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not easy matter is it<br/>
					to win that which he formerly had not won,<br/>
					even that for the sake of which<br/>
					clansmen rightly leave the home<br/>
					for the homeless,<br/>
					even that uttermost goal of the divine living<br/>
					which he has attained,<br/>
					wherein he abides,<br/>
					having come to know it thoroughly for himself<br/>
					and to realize it."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Wellfarer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Swans, herons, peacocks, elephants, and eke the dappled deer,<br/>
					      Varied as may their bodies be, all dothe lion fear.<br/>
					      So among men a puny lada, if o nlyhe be wise,<br/>
					      Is truly great, not so the fool though large he be in size.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> See <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 230. The <b>Comy.</b> here also gives the legends of the karma that made him so unslghtly (as a rāja he mocked old people), and that gave him the lovely voice which finds no mention in this work.</p>
