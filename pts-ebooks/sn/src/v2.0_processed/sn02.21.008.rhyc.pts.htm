					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Nanda,<br/>
					nephew of the Exalted One's mother,<br/>
					donning robes that had been dressed on both sides,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					painting his eyes<br/>
					and taking a bright, clean bowl,<br/>
					went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him,<br/>
					and took his seat beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him so seated the Exalted One said: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not meet is it for thee, Nanda,<br/>
					who as a clansman,<br/>
					left the world infaith,<br/>
					going from home to the homeless,<br/>
					to don robes that have been dressed on both sides,<br/>
					to paint thine eyes<br/>
					and bear about a bright, spotless bowl.</p>

					<p class="f4">Meet for thee, Nanda,<br/>
					is it that thou shouldst be a forest-dweller,<br/>
					an almsman<br/>
					and a ragged robeman,<br/>
					and that thou shouldst dwell<br/>
					unheeding desires of sense."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Wellfarer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Maybe some day shall I see<br/>
					      Nanda a forest-votary,<br/>
					      In gear cast out he knows not whence,<br/>
					      His maintenance supplied<br/>
					      By food he knows as cast aside,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					      Heedless to calls of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Nanda after that became a forest-dweller and an almsman, and a rag-robeman, heedless as to desires of sense.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This method, corresponding posssibly to our 'presssing cloth,' is described as rapping with hand or mallet, and again rapping after reversing the cloth. <i>Cf. Dhammapada, Comy.</i> i, 37. On Nanda see <i>Udāna,</i> p. 21, <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 46. B. here states that he 'got himself up' to evoke an opinion from his cousin — either 'truly this little brother of mine is beautiful!' or a fault-finding — that he might dress accordingly for the rest of his life.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> So the <i>Comy.</i> 'marked off when choice food is selected for the great folk.' <i>Cf.</i> <i>Pss. of the Sisters,</i> p. 144, <b>n.</b>1.</p>
