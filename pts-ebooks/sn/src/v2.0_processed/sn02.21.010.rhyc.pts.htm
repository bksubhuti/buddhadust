					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Rājagaha<br/>
					in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a certain brother<br/>
					by name Senior<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					was living alone<br/>
					and was commending such a life.</p>

					<p class="f4">He entered the village alone for alms,<br/>
					he returned alone,<br/>
					alone he sat in private [meditation]<br/>
					and alone he practised his terrace-walk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of brethren went into the presence of the Exalted One<br/>
					and told him of this brother's mode of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One spoke to a certain brother saying: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come thou, brother,<br/>
					tell my word to Brother Senior: —<br/>
					'The Master, friend Senior, calls for thee.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord," responded the brother, and called the venerable Senior.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, friend," responded the venerable Senior,<br/>
					and he came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him,<br/>
					and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him so seated<br/>
					the Exalted One said: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true what they say, Senior,<br/>
					that you are living quite alone<br/>
					and commending such a life?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What sort of life is this<br/>
					that you lead and commend?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is this, lord,<br/>
					that I enter the village alone for alms,<br/>
					return alone,<br/>
					sit alone [to meditate],<br/>
					and perform the terrace-walk alone."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is livig alone, Senior;<br/>
					I do not say it is not so.</p>

					<p class="f4">But further,<br/>
					there is a way of perfecting the solitary life in detail<br/>
					which I will tell you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen well<br/>
					and give your mind thoroughly."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, Senior,<br/>
					is the solitary life perfected in detai?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is when that which is past<br/>
					is put away;<br/>
					when that which is future<br/>
					is given up,<br/>
					and when, with regard to present self-states<br/>
					that we have got,<br/>
					will and passion have been thoroughly mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Senior,<br/>
					that the solitary life is perfected in detail."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Wellfarer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Who overcometh all, who understandeth all,<br/>
					      Whoso is very wise, in all things undefiled,<br/>
					      Who all abandoning, in death of craving free,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					      That is the man of whom I'd say, 'He lives alone.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Craving is sometimes called one's 'second' (<i>alter ego</i> or mate). <i>Cf.</i> <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> verse 54, 1091; <i>Majjhima</i> i, 171.</p>
