					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now two brethren who were comrades,<br/>
					dwelling together with the venerable Mahā-Kappina,<br/>
					came into the presence of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One saw them coming yet afar,<br/>
					and seeing them he called to the brethren: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you see coming to us, brethren, those two comrade-brethren who are dwelling together with Kappina?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those two, brrethren, are highly gifted,<br/>
					of wondrous power.</p>

					<p class="f4">No easy matter is it to win<br/>
					that which they formerly had not won,<br/>
					even that for the sake of which<br/>
					clansmen rightly leave the home<br/>
					for the homeless,<br/>
					even that uttermost goal of the divine living<br/>
					which they have attained,<br/>
					wherein they abide,<br/>
					having come just here and now<br/>
					to know it thoroughly for themselves<br/>
					and to realize it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Wellfarer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Comrades these brethren are for sure.<br/>
					      Long time have they together fared.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					      The holy Norm fares on in them,<br/>
					      The Norm that Buddhas tell to men,<br/>
					      The Norm that Ariyans tell to men,<br/>
					      By Kappina therein well trained,<br/>
					      They bear their final body now,<br/>
					      For they are devil-conquerors.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Sameti = saṇsandati,</i> the word rendered 'flow together,' above, p. 108. The legend is that they had been somehow with each other in five hundred previous lives.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Cf. above, pp. 18, 189</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> There is a poetically framed envoi added, by scribe or editor, in the three Singhalese MSS. used by Feer: — Long may the river of the Word of the Conqueror, springing from the rock of him of the ten powers, having the ocean of Nibbāna as its goal, [flowing with] the wters of the passing away, bear [us] on!</p>
