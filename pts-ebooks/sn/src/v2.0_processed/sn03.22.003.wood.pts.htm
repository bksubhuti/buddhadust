					<p><span class="f2">[9]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[10]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Kaccāna<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Great was dwelling among the folk of Avanti<br/>
					at Ospreys' Haunt<br/>
					on a sheer mountain crag.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Hāliddikāni came to the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br/>
					and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the housefather Hāliddikāni thus addressed the venerable Kaccāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master, it was said by the Exalted One<br/>
					in the eighth chapter in the <i>Questions of Māgandiya</i> —<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Home he abandons: homeless wandering<br/>
							The sage with village-folk not making ties.<br/>
							Empty of lusts, showing no preference,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
							With no man wageth wordy warfare more.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, Master, how should one regard the full meaning<br/>
					of this concisely spoken saying<br/>
					of the Exalted One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The material element, housefather,<br/>
					is the home of consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now consciousness,<br/>
					being lust-tied to the material <span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span> element,<br/>
					is called 'home-haunter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, housefather, the feeling-element<br/>
					is the home of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus being lust-tied to the feeling-element,<br/>
					consciousness is called 'home-haunter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the perception-element, housefather,<br/>
					is the home of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus being lust-tied to the perception-element,<br/>
					consciousness is called 'home-haunter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the activities-element, housefather,<br/>
					is the home of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus being lust-tied to the activities element,<br/>
					consciousness is called 'home-haunter.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That, housefather,<br/>
					is the meaning of the word<br/>
					'home-haunter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, housefather,<br/>
					is one a 'home-abandoner'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now as to the material element, housefather,<br/>
					that desire, that lust, that lure,<br/>
					that craving,<br/>
					those system-graspings,<br/>
					that mental standpoint,<br/>
					that dogmatic bias<br/>
					which is inherent therein<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					— all these for a Tathāgata are struck off,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br/>
					made things that have ceased to be,<br/>
					so that they cannot grow up again in the future.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So it is also, housefather,<br/>
					with the feeling-element,<br/>
					the perception-element,<br/>
					the activities-element,<br/>
					the consciousness-element<br/>
					— that desire, that lust, that lure,<br/>
					cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, housefather,<br/>
					a Tathāgata is called 'home-abandoner.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the meaning of the word.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one an 'adherent'?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">One who is in bondage to the impressions<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span> of things seen, housefather,<br/>
					is called 'adherent.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise with regard to sounds,<br/>
					smells,<br/>
					savours,<br/>
					tangibles<br/>
					and mental objects<br/>
					— he who is in bondage to these impressions<br/>
					is called 'adherent.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one 'non-adherent,' housefather?</p>

					<p class="f4">Such bondage to impressions of things seen is,<br/>
					for a Tathāgata,<br/>
					struck off,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like a palm-tree <span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span> stump,<br/>
					made things that have ceased to be,<br/>
					so that they cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, housefather, a Tathāgata is called 'non-adherent.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So also with regard to sounds,<br/>
					smells,<br/>
					savours,<br/>
					tangibles<br/>
					and mental objects<br/>
					— such bondage is not found in a Tathāgata:<br/>
					therefore is he called 'non-adherent.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That, housefather, is the meaning of the word.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one 'a former of ties in the village'?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather,<br/>
					a certain one lives intimate with householders.</p>

					<p class="f4">He shares their joys and sorrows;<br/>
					among the happy he is happy,<br/>
					among the unhappy he is unhappy.</p>

					<p class="f4">When affairs of business arise,<br/>
					he involves himself in these.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, housefather, is how one is 'a former of ties in the village.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one 'no former of ties in the village'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, a brother<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span> dwells not associating with householders:<br/>
					he shares not their joys and sorrows,<br/>
					is not happy amid the happy,<br/>
					unhappy amid the unhappy.</p>

					<p class="f4">When affairs of business arise,<br/>
					he does not involve himself in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, one forms no ties in the village.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one 'not empty'?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, a certain one<br/>
					has not abandoned lust,<br/>
					has not abandoned desire,<br/>
					nor affection,<br/>
					nor thirst,<br/>
					nor fever and craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, he is 'not empty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one 'empty'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, a certain one<br/>
					has abandoned lust,<br/>
					has abandoned desire,<br/>
					likewise affection<br/>
					and thirst,<br/>
					fever and craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, is one 'empty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does one 'show no preference'?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, one thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I have such and such a body in future time:<br/>
					may I feel thus and thus:<br/>
					may I perceive thus and thus:<br/>
					may my activities be such and such:<br/>
					may my consciousness be such and such in future time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, does one show preference.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span> And how does one 'show no preference'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, one does not think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I have such and such a body in future time:<br/>
					may I feel,<br/>
					may I perceive thus and thus:<br/>
					may my activities be such and such:<br/>
					may my consciousness be such and such in future time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, does one show no preference.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one a 'wager of wordy warfare with people'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, a certain one makes talk like this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You know not about this norm-discipline.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I do know about this norm-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">How could you know about it?</p>

					<p class="f4">You have fallen on wrong views.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I have come by right views.</p>

					<p class="f4">You speak last what should come first,<br/>
					and first what should come last.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am speaking to the point:<br/>
					you are not.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What you have thought out so long is quite upset.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Your view is confuted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go, explain yourself.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are shown up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clear yourself if you can!"</p>

					<p class="f4">That, housefather, is how one is a<br/>
					'wager of wordy warfare with people.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one<br/>
					'no wager of wordy warfare with people'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, a brother makes not talk like this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You know not about this norm-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do know about this norm-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">How could you know about it?</p>

					<p class="f4">You have fallen on wrong views.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have come by right views.</p>

					<p class="f4">You speak last what should come first,<br/>
					and first what should come last.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am speaking to the point:<br/>
					you are not.</p>

					<p class="f4">What you have thought out so long is quite upset.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your view is confuted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go, explain yourself.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are shown up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clear yourself if you can!'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how one is 'no wager of wordy warfare with people.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And this, housefather, is the meaning<br/>
					of what was said by the Exalted One<br/>
					in the eighth chapter of Magandiya's Questions, to wit:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Home he abandons: homeless wandering<br/>
							The sage with village-folk not making ties.<br/>
							Empty of lusts, showing no preference,<br/>
							With no man wageth wordy warfare more.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, should be understood in full<br/>
					what was concisely stated by the Exalted One.'</p>
