					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thus spake the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will show you grasping and worry, brethren:<br/>
					likewise not grasping and not worrying.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to it,<br/>
					apply your minds to it thoroughly<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, brethren, is there grasping and worry?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the untaught many-folk have this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This body is mine:<br/>
					I am this:<br/>
					this is my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an one<br/>
					the body alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of body,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe, lamentation and despair arise in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This feeling is mine:<br/>
					I am this:<br/>
					this is my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an one<br/>
					feeling alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of feeling,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe, lamentation and despair arise in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This perception is mine:<br/>
					I am this:<br/>
					this is my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an one<br/>
					perception alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of perception,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe, lamentation and despair arise in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">'These activities are mine:<br/>
					I am this:<br/>
					this is my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an one<br/>
					the activities alter and become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of the activities,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe, lamentation and despair arise in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This consciousness is mine:<br/>
					I am this:<br/>
					this is my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an one<br/>
					consciousness alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the altering and otherwiseness of consciousness,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe, lamentation and despair arise in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, brethren, is there grasping and worry.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, brethren, is there no grasping and no worry?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple has this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This body is not mine:<br/>
					I am not this:<br/>
					this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an one<br/>
					the body alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of body,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This feeling is not mine:<br/>
					I am not this:<br/>
					this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an one<br/>
					feeling alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of feeling,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This perception is not mine:<br/>
					I am not this:<br/>
					this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an one<br/>
					perception alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of perception,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">'These activities are not mine:<br/>
					I am not this:<br/>
					this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an one<br/>
					the activities alter and become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of the activities,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This consciousness is not mine:<br/>
					I am not this:<br/>
					this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an one<br/>
					consciousness alters and becomes otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in spite of the altering and otherwiseness of consciousness,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					woe, lamentation and despair arise not in him."</p>
