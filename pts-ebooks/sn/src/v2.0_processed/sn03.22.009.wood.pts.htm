					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus addressed the brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/>
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for a body that is <span class="f3"><i>[19]</i></span> past,<br/>
					is not in love with a body to be,<br/>
					and for the present body<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present'.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/>
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for feeling that is past,<br/>
					is not in love with feeling to be,<br/>

					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present'.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are impermanent,<br/>
