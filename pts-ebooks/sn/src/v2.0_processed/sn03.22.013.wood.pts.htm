					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is ill,<br/>
					feeling, is an ill,<br/>
					perception, is an ill,<br/>
					the activities, are an ill,<br/>
					consciousness is an ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is repelled by body,<br/>
					is repelled by feeling,<br/>
					is repelled by perception,<br/>
					is repelled by the activities<br/>
					is repelled by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled<br/>
					he lusts not<br/>
					not lusting he is set free<br/>
					in this freedom comes insight<br/>
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is my task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
