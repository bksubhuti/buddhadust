					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/>
					that is suffering.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is repelled by body,<br/>
					is repelled by feeling,<br/>
					is repelled by perception,<br/>
					is repelled by the activities<br/>
					is repelled by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled<br/>
					he lusts not<br/>
					not lusting he is set free<br/>
					in this freedom comes insight<br/>
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is my task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>

See <i>Pāli Dict.</i> s.v. which suggests 'ease' and 'dis-ease,' 'wealth and ilth,' 'well-being' and 'ill-being.' But all these words have now various significances. 'Ill-fare' is used in Elizabethan literature. Buddhaghosa defines the word at <i>V.M.</i> 461, and at p. 494 attempts its derivation (not very successfully) in <i>du,</i> 'mean, inferior'; 'khaṃ,' empty. But the underlying idea seems to be 'ill-put-together, temporary, unreal, unsatisfactory.' <i>Cf.</i> <i>Expositor</i> i, 53,54, and note on next page; Mrs. Rhys Davids, <i>Bud.
