					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is void of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is void of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is void of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are void of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is void of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not it,<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is repelled by body,<br/>
					is repelled by feeling,<br/>
					is repelled by perception,<br/>
					is repelled by the activities<br/>
					is repelled by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled<br/>
					he lusts not<br/>
					not lusting he is set free<br/>
					in this freedom comes insight<br/>
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is my task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
