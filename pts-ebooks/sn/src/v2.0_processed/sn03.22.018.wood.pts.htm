					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/>
					that which is the condition<br/>
					of the arising of body,<br/>
					that also is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can a body<br/>
					which is compounded of the impermanent<br/>
					come to be permanent?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/>
					that which is the condition<br/>
					of the uprising of feeling,<br/>
					that also is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can feeling<br/>
					which is compounded of the impermanent<br/>
					come to be permanent?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/>
					that which is the condition<br/>
					of the uprising of perception,<br/>
					that also is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can perception<br/>
					which is compounded of the impermanent<br/>
					come to be permanent?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities are impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/>
					that which is the condition<br/>
					of the uprising of the activities,<br/>
					that also is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can the activities<br/>
					which are compounded of the impermanent<br/>
					come to be permanent?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br/>
					that which is the condition<br/>
					of the uprising of consciousness,<br/>
					that also is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can consciousness<br/>
					which is compounded of the impermanent<br/>
					come to be permanent?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is repelled by body,<br/>
					is repelled by feeling,<br/>
					is repelled by perception,<br/>
					is repelled by the activities<br/>
					is repelled by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled<br/>
					he lusts not<br/>
					not lusting he is set free<br/>
					in this freedom comes insight<br/>
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is my task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
