					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That desire and lust, brethren,<br/>
					which is in body,<br/>
					do ye renounce them.</p>

					<p class="f4">So will that body become rejected,<br/>
					cut down <span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span> at the root,<br/>
					made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/>
					made something that has ceased to be,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">That desire and lust, brethren,<br/>
					which is in feeling,<br/>
					do ye renounce them.</p>

					<p class="f4">So will that feeling become rejected,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/>
					made something that has ceased to be,<br/>
					so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">That desire and lust, brethren,<br/>
					which is in perception,<br/>
					do ye renounce them.</p>

					<p class="f4">So will that perception become rejected,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/>
					made something that has ceased to be,<br/>
					so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">That desire and lust, brethren,<br/>
					which is in the activities,<br/>
					do ye renounce them.</p>

					<p class="f4">So will those activities become rejected,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/>
					made something that has ceased to be,<br/>
					so that they cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">That desire and lust, brethren,<br/>
					which is in consciousness,<br/>
					do ye renounce them.</p>

					<p class="f4">So will that consciousness become rejected,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br/>
					made something that has ceased to be,<br/>
					so that it cannot grow up again in the future."</p>
