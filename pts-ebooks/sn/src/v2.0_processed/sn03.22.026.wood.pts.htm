					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Formerly, brethren,<br/>
					before I was enlightened with the supreme enlightenment,<br/>
					when I was yet a Bodhisat,<br/>
					I thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					what is the misery of,<br/>
					what is the way of escape<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now what is the satisfaction,<br/>
					what is the misery of,<br/>
					what is the way of escape<br/>
					from feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what is the satisfaction,<br/>
					what is the misery of,<br/>
					what is the way of escape<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now what is the satisfaction,<br/>
					what is the misery of,<br/>
					what is the way of escape<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now what is the satisfaction,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then, brethren, to me there came this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span> So long, brethren, as I did not thoroughly understand,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					the satisfaction of these five factors of grasping as such,<br/>
					the misery of it as such,<br/>

					so long, brethren, was I doubtful<br/>
					whether I was enlightened<br/>
					with that supreme enlightenment,<br/>
					unsurpassed in the world<br/>
					with its devas,<br/>
					its Māras,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But as soon, brethren, as I thoroughly understood,<br/>
