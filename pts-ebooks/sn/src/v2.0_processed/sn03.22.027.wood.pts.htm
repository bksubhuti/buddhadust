					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, I practised<br/>
					the search after the satisfaction<br/>
					which is in body,<br/>
					and to this conclusion I came:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In so far as there is satisfaction of body,<br/>
					that by insight have I rightly seen.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, I practised<br/>

					which is in body,<br/>
					and to this conclusion I came:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In so far as there is misery of body,<br/>
					that by insight have I rightly seen.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, I practised<br/>
					the search after the way of escape from body,<br/>
					and to this conclusion I came:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In so far as there is a way of escape from body,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So long, brethren, as I did not thoroughly understand,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					the satisfaction of these five factors of grasping as such,<br/>
					the misery of it as such,<br/>
					the way of escape from it as such, -<br/>
					so long, brethren, was I doubtful<br/>
					whether I was enlightened<br/>
					with that supreme enlightenment,<br/>
					unsurpassed in the world<br/>
					with its devas,<br/>
					its Māras,<br/>
					its Brahmas,<br/>
					among the host of recluses and brahmins<br/>
					and of devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as soon, brethren, as I thoroughly understood,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					the satisfaction of these five factors of grasping as such,<br/>
					the misery of it as such,<br/>
					the way of escape from it as such, -<br/>
					then, brethren, I knew for certain<br/>
					that I was enlightened<br/>
					with that supreme enlightenment<br/>
					unsurpassed in the world,<br/>
					with its devas,<br/>
					its Māras,<br/>
					its Brahmas,<br/>
					among the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					and of devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, indeed, the knowledge arose in me<br/>
					and insight aröse in me: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sure is my release.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my last birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no more rebirth for me now.'"</p>
