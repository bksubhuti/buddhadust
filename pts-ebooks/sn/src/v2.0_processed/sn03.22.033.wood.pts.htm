					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is not of you, brethren,<br/>
					put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[32]</b></span> And what, brethren, is not of you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Body, brethren, is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br/>
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br/>
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br/>
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away<br/>
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br/>
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, brethren,<br/>
					a man should gather,<br/>
					burn,<br/>
					or do what he please<br/>
					with all the grass,<br/>
					all the sticks,<br/>
					branches<br/>
					and stalks<br/>
					in this Jeta Grove, -<br/>
					pray would ye say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This man is gathering, burning us,<br/>
					doing what he please with us?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, lord, this is not our self,<br/>
					nor of the nature of self."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brethren, body is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br/>
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br/>
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br/>
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away<br/>
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br/>
					will be for your profit and welfare.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
