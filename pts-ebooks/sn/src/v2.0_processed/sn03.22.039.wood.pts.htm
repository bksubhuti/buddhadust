					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of that brother, brethren,<br/>
					who is versed in conformity to the Norm,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					this is the accordant practice:</p>

					<p class="f4">He should abide in the utter disgust for body,<br/>
					he should abide in the utter disgust for feeling,<br/>
					he should abide in the utter disgust for perception,<br/>
					he should abide in the utter disgust for the activities,<br/>
					he should abide in the utter disgust for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So abiding in the utter disgust for body,<br/>
					in the utter disgust for feeling,<br/>
					in the utter disgust for perception,<br/>
					in the utter disgust for the activities,<br/>
					in the utter disgust for consciousness,<br/>
					he fully discerns body,<br/>
					he fully discerns feeling,<br/>
					he fully discerns perception,<br/>
					he fully discerns the activities,<br/>
					he fully discerns consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fully discerning body,<br/>
					fully discerning feeling,<br/>
					fully discerning perception,<br/>
					fully discerning the activities,<br/>
					fully discerning consciousness;<br/>
					he is released from body,<br/>
					he is released from feeling,<br/>
					he is released from perception,<br/>
					he is released from activities,<br/>
					he is released from consciousness,<br/>
					he is released from rebirth,<br/>
					old age and decay,<br/>
					sorrow and grief,<br/>
					from woe,<br/>
					lamentation<br/>
					and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">I declare him to be released from suffering."</p>
