					<p class="f4">Then (the Exalted One) said:—</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do ye abide, brethren,<br/>

					refuges unto yourselves:<br/>
					taking refuge in none other;<br/>
					islanded by the Norm,<br/>
					taking refuge in the Norm,<br/>
					seeking refuge in none other.</p>

					— by them the very source of things<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">'What is the source of sorrow and grief,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What is their origin?'</p>

					<p class="f4">What then, brethren,<br/>
					is the source,<br/>
					the origin of these?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren,<br/>
					the untaught many-folk,<br/>
					who discern not those that are Ariyans,<br/>
					who are unskilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/>
					untrained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/>
					who discern not those who are worthy ones,<br/>
					who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/>
					untrained in the worthy doctrine,<br/>
					— these regard the body as the self,<br/>
					the self as having body,<br/>
