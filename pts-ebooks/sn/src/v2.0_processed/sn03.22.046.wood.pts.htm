					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is without the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not that,<br/>
					not of me is this self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should one view it<br/>
					by perfect insight<br/>
					as it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is without the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not that,<br/>
					not of me is this self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should one view it<br/>
					by perfect insight<br/>
					as it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is without the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not that,<br/>
					not of me is this self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should one view it<br/>
					by perfect insight<br/>
					as it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is without the self,<br/>
					that is not mine,<br/>
					I am not that,<br/>
					not of me is this self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should one view it<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What is without the self,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus should one view it<br/>

					as it really is.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">For the one who thus sees it<br/>
					as it really is<br/>
					by perfect insight,<br/>
					there is no more guessing at the far-off past.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As there is no more guessing at the far-off past,<br/>
					there is no more guessing at the far-off future.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is no more guessing at the far-off future,<br/>
					there is no stubborn<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> perversity.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is no more stubborn perversity in him,<br/>
					his heart turns away from body,<br/>
					from feeling,<br/>
					perception,<br/>
					the activities<br/>
					and consciousness,<br/>
					and is released by not grasping at the <i>āsavas.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Then by its release it is steadfast;<br/>
					by its steadfastness it is happy;<br/>
					by its happiness it is not troubled;<br/>
					not being troubled,<br/>
					of its own self it is utterly well;<br/>
					so that he knows:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
