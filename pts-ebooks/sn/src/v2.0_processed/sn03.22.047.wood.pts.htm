					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those recluses and brahmins, brethren,<br/>
					who regard the self in divers ways,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					regard it as the body-mass<br/>
					of five factors based on grasping,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					or as some one of these.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the untaught many-folk,<br/>
					who discern not those that are Ariyans,<br/>
					who are unskilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/>
					untrained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br/>
					who discern not those who are worthy ones,<br/>
					who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine,<br/>
					untrained in the worthy doctrine, —<br/>
					regard body as the self,<br/>
					self as possessed of body,<br/>
					body as being in the self,<br/>
					self as being in body;</p>

					<p class="f4">view feeling as the self<br/>
					the self as possessed of feeling,<br/>
					feeling as being in the self,<br/>
					the self as being in feeling;</p>

					<p class="f4">view perception as the self<br/>
					the self as possessed of perception,<br/>
					perception as being in the self,<br/>
					the self as being in perception;</p>

					<p class="f4">view the activities as the self<br/>
					the self as possessed of the activities,<br/>
					the activities as being in the self,<br/>
					the self as being in the activities;</p>

					<p class="f4">view consciousness as the self<br/>
					the self as possessed of consciousness,<br/>
					consciousness as being in the self,<br/>
					the self as being in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this is the view.</p>

					<p class="f4">It has come to him (to think): 'I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when it has come to anyone<br/>
					to think 'I am,'<br/>
					there comes to pass a descent<br/>
					of the five feeling-faculties<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					the seeing-faculty,<br/>
					the hearing-faculty,<br/>
					the smelling-faculty,<br/>
					the tasting-faculty,<br/>
					the touching-faculty.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span> Mind is the result,<br/>
					mind-states<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> are the result,<br/>
					the ignorarnce-element is the result.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by the feeling<br/>
					born of contact with ignorance,<br/>
					there comes to the untaught many-folk (the view),<br/>
					'I am';</p>

					<p class="f4">there comes (the view),<br/>
					'this same I am;'</p>

					<p class="f4">there comes (the view),<br/>
					'things will be';</p>

					<p class="f4">there comes the view,<br/>
					'things will not be';<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">there comes the view,<br/>
					'things will have body';</p>

					<p class="f4">the view,<br/>
					'things will be bodyless';</p>

					<p class="f4">there comes the view,<br/>
					'things will be conscious';</p>

					<p class="f4">the view,<br/>
					'things will be unconscious';</p>

					<p class="f4">the view,<br/>
					'things will be neither conscious nor unconscious.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just therein, brethren,<br/>
					that the five feeling-faculties persist.</p>

					<p class="f4">But herein for the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					ignorance is put away<br/>
					and knowledge arises.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Along with the fading away of ignorance<br/>
					and the arising of knowledge<br/>
					there comes to him no view that<br/>
					'I am,'<br/>
					that<br/>
					'this same I am,'<br/>
					that<br/>
					'things will be,'<br/>
					that<br/>
					'things will not be,'<br/>
					that<br/>
					'things will have body,'<br/>
					that<br/>
					'things will not have body,'<br/>
					that<br/>
					'things will be conscious,'<br/>
					that<br/>
					'things will be unconscious,'<br/>
					that<br/>
					'things will be neither conscious nor unconscious.'"</p>
