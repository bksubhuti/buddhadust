					<p class="f4">At Benares,<br/>
					in the Deer Park<br/>
					was the occasion<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> (for this discourse).</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the Exalted One thus addressed<br/>
					the band of five brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">If body, brethren, were the Self,<br/>
					then body would not be involved in sickness,<br/>
					and one could say of body:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus let my body be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus let my body not be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, brethren, inasmuch as body<br/>
					is not the Self,<br/>
					that is why body is involved in sickness,<br/>
					and one cannot say of body:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus let my body be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus let my body not be.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">If feeling, brethren, were the Self,<br/>
					then feeling would not be involved in sickness,<br/>
					and one could say of feeling:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus let my feeling be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus let my feeling not be.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">If perception, brethren, were the Self,<br/>
					then perception would not be involved in sickness,<br/>
					and one could say of perception:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus let my perception be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus let my perception not be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Activities, brethren, are not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">If activities, brethren, were the Self,<br/>
					then activities would not be involved in sickness,<br/>
					and one could say of activities:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus let my activities be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus let my activities not be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, brethren, inasmuch as activities are not the Self,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">If consciousness, brethren, were the Self,<br/>
					then consciousness would not be involved in sickness,<br/>
					and one could say of consciousness:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus let my consciousness be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus let my consciousness not be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, brethren, inasmuch as consciousness is not the Self,<br/>

					feels disgust for body,<br/>
					feels disgust for feeling,<br/>
					feels disgust for perception,<br/>
					feels disgust for the activities,<br/>
					feels disgust for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So feeling disgust<br/>
					he is repelled;<br/>
					being repelled,<br/>
					he is freed;<br/>
					knowledge arises<br/>
					that in the freed<br/>

					so that he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth;<br/>
					lived is the righteous life;<br/>
					done is my task;<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br/>
					and the band of five brethren were pleased thereat,<br/>
					and welcomed what was said by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, by this teaching<br/>
					thus uttered<br/>
					the hearts of those five brethren<br/>
					were freed from the <i>āsavas</i><br/>
					without grasping.</p>
