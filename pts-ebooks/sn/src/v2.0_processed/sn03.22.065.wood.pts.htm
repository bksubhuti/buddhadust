					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine,<br/>
					so that hearing the doctrine of the Exalted One<br/>
					I might dwell solitary,<br/>
					secluded,<br/>
					zealous,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and aspiring."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brother, if one be enamoured,<br/>
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he be enamoured not,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I understand, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">I understand, Well-farer!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But in what way, brother,<br/>
					do you understand in full<br/>
					the meaning of what I spoke concisely?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Enamoured of body,<br/>
					one is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enamoured of feeling,<br/>
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enamoured of perception,<br/>
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enamoured of the activities,<br/>
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enamoured of consciousness,<br/>
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, lord, is how I understand in full<br/>
					what was concisely spoken by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well have you understood in full<br/>
					the meaning of what I spoke concisely.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is indeed by enamoured body,<br/>
					one is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enamoured of feeling,<br/>
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enamoured of perception,<br/>
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enamoured of the activities,<br/>
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enamoured of consciousness,<br/>
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not enamoured,<br/>
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so should be understood in full<br/>
					what I said concisely."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon that brother gladly heard the words of the Exalted One<br/>
					and welcomed them,<br/>
					and he rose from his seat,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereafter that brother,<br/>
					dwelling solitary,<br/>
					secluded,<br/>
					zealous,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and aspiring,<br/>
					in no long time<br/>
					attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br/>
					to win which the clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless,<br/>
					so that in that very life<br/>
					of himself<br/>
					he fully understood it,<br/>
					realized it<br/>
					and abode therein,<br/>
					and knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions there is no hereafter."</p>

					<p class="f4">So that brother was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
