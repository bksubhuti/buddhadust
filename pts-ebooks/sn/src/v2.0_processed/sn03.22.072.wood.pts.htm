					<p><span class="f2">[80]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[67]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/>
					In jeta Grove,<br/>
					at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Surādha came to the Exalted One,<br/>
					and saluting him,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Surādha thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How in him who knows,<br/>
					how in him who sees, lord,<br/>
					in this body with its consciousness,<br/>
					and likewise in all external objects,<br/>
					has mind gone away from all ideas of 'I' and 'mine,'<br/>
					and has passed beyond the ways of conceit<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and is utterly liberated?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever material object, Surādha,<br/>
					be it past,<br/>
					future<br/>
					or present,<br/>
					inward or outward,<br/>
					gross or subtle,<br/>
					low or high,<br/>
					far or near,<br/>
					one regards thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/>
					this am not I;<br/>
					this is not the Self of me' -</p>

					<p class="f4">so seeing things as <span class="f2 g"><b>[68]</b></span> they really are,<br/>
					by right insight,<br/>
					one is liberated without grasping.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever feeling, Surādha,<br/>
					be it past,<br/>
					future<br/>
					or present,<br/>
					inward or outward,<br/>
					gross or subtle,<br/>
					low or high,<br/>
					far or near,<br/>
					one regards thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/>
					this am not I;<br/>
					this is not the Self of me' -</p>

					<p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever perception, Surādha,<br/>
					be it past,<br/>
					future<br/>
					or present,<br/>
					inward or outward,<br/>
					gross or subtle,<br/>
					low or high,<br/>
					far or near,<br/>
					one regards thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/>
					this am not I;<br/>
					this is not the Self of me' -</p>

					<p class="f4">so seeing things as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight,<br/>
					one is liberated without grasping.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever activities, Surādha,<br/>
					be they past,<br/>
					future<br/>
					or present,<br/>
					inward or outward,<br/>
					gross or subtle,<br/>
					low or high,<br/>
					far or near,<br/>
					one regards thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/>
					this am not I;<br/>
					this is not the Self of me' -</p>

					<p class="f4">so seeing things as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight,<br/>
					one is liberated without grasping.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever consciousness, Surādha,<br/>
					be it past,<br/>
					future<br/>
					or present,<br/>
					inward or outward,<br/>
					gross or subtle,<br/>
					low or high,<br/>
					far or near,<br/>
					one regards thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/>
					this am not I;<br/>
					this is not the Self of me' -</p>

					<p class="f4">so seeing things as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight,<br/>
					one is liberated without grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Surādha,<br/>
					in him who knows,<br/>
					in him who sees, lord,<br/>
					in this body with its consciousness,<br/>
					and likewise in all external objects,<br/>
					has mind gone away from all ideas of 'I' and 'mine,'<br/>
					and has passed beyond the ways of conceit<br/>
					and is utterly liberated."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Surādha gladly heard the words of the Exalted One<br/>
					and welcomed them,<br/>
					and he rose from his seat,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One<br/>
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereafter the venerable Surādha,<br/>
					dwelling solitary,<br/>
					secluded,<br/>
					zealous,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and aspiring,<br/>
					in no long time<br/>
					attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br/>
					to win which the clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless,<br/>
					so that in that very life<br/>
					of himself<br/>
					he fully understood it,<br/>
					realized it<br/>
					and abode therein,<br/>
					and knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions there is no hereafter."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Surādha was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
