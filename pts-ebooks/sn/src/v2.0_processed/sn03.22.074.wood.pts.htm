					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/>
					In jeta Grove,<br/>
					at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, the untaught many-folk understand not<br/>
					as they really are<br/>
					the arising of body,<br/>
					the going out of it,<br/>
					the escape from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">They understand not<br/>
					the arising of feeling,<br/>
					the going out of it,<br/>
					the escape from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">They understand not<br/>
					the arising of perception,<br/>
					the going out of it,<br/>
					the escape from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">They understand not<br/>
					the arising of the activities,<br/>
					the going out of them,<br/>
					the escape from them.</p>

					<p class="f4">They understand not<br/>
					the arising of consciousness,<br/>
					the going out of it,<br/>
					the escape from it.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					does understand as they really are<br/>
					the arising of body,<br/>
					the going out of it,<br/>
					the escape from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does understand<br/>
					the arising of feeling,<br/>
					the going out of it,<br/>
					the escape from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does understand<br/>
					the arising of perception,<br/>
					the going out of it,<br/>
					the escape from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does understand<br/>
					the arising of the activities,<br/>
					the going out of them,<br/>
					the escape from them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does understand<br/>
					the arising of consciousness,<br/>
					the going out of it,<br/>
					the escape from it."</p>
