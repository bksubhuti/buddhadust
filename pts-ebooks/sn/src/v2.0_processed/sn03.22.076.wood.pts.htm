					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/>
					In jeta Grove,<br/>
					at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span> What is not the Self,</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/>
					that am not I,<br/>
					that is not the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/>
					that am not I,<br/>
					that is not the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/>
					that am not I,<br/>
					that is not the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/>
					that am not I,<br/>
					that is not the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/>
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					feels disgust at body,<br/>
					feels disgust at feeling,<br/>
					feels disgust at perception,<br/>
					feels disgust at activities<br/>
					feels disgust at consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling disgust<br/>
					he is repelled:<br/>
					by repulsion he is released;<br/>
					by that release<br/>
					set free,<br/>
					knowledge arises:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the freed man<br/>
					is the free thing'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth;<br/>
					lived is the righteous life;<br/>
					done is the task;<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Throughout the seven abodes, brethren,<br/>
					up to the highest becoming,<br/>
					these are the topmost,<br/>
					these are the best in all the world, -<br/>
					these Arahants."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Well-farer having so said,<br/>
					the Teacber said this further:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Ah, happy saints, the Arahants! In them no craving's seen.<br/>
							The 'I' conceit is rooted up: delusion's net is burst.<br/>
							Lust-free they have attained; translucent is the heart of them.<br/>
							These god-like beings, drug-immune, unspotted in the world,<br/>
							Knowing the fivefold mass, they roam the seven domains of good.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

					      <p class="f4 in2">These mighty heroes follow on, exempt from fear and dread:<br/>
							Lords of the tenfold potency,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> great sages tranquillized:<br/>
							Best beings they in all the world; in them no craving's seen.<br/>
							<span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span> They've won the knowledge of adepts. This compound is their last.<br/>
							That essence of the holy life<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> that have they made their own.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
							Unshaken by the triple modes,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> set free from birth to come,<br/>
							The plane of self-control they've won, victorious in the world.<br/>
							Upward or crossways or below<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> - no lure is found in them.<br/>
							They sound aloud their lion's roar 'Supreme are they that wake.'"</p>
