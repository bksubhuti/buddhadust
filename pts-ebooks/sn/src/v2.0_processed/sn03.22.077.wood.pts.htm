					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī<br/>
					In jeta Grove,<br/>
					at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/>
					that am not I,<br/>
					that is not the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/>
					that am not I,<br/>
					that is not the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/>
					that am not I,<br/>
					that is not the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/>
					that am not I,<br/>
					that is not the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br/>
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br/>
					that is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is not the Self,</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is not mine,<br/>
					that am not I,<br/>
					that is not the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					by right insight.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/>
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					feels disgust at body,<br/>
					feels disgust at feeling,<br/>
					feels disgust at perception,<br/>
					feels disgust at activities<br/>
					feels disgust at consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling disgust<br/>
					he is repelled:<br/>
					by repulsion he is released;<br/>
					by that release<br/>
					set free,<br/>
					knowledge arises:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the freed man<br/>
					is the free thing'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth;<br/>
					lived is the righteous life;<br/>
					done is the task;<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Throughout the seven abodes, brethren,<br/>
					up to the highest becoming,<br/>
					these are the topmost,<br/>
					these are the best in all the world, -<br/>
					these Arahants."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>
