					<p><span class="f2">[94]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[80]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:—</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Kosambī<br/>
					in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/>
					robing himself at early dawn<br/>
					and taking bowl and robe,<br/>
					entered Kosambī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had been his rounds for alms in Kosambī,<br/>
					on his return from begging<br/>
					he ate his meal,<br/>
					and setting his own bed in order,<br/>
					he took bowl and robe,<br/>
					and without calling his attendants<br/>
					or giving notice to the Order of brethren,<br/>
					alone and unattended,<br/>
					went forth a-wandering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain brother,<br/>
					not long after the Exalted One had gone out,<br/>
					came to the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					and addressed him <span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span> thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Ānanda, the Exalted One has set his own bed in order,<br/>
					taken bowl and robe,<br/>
					and without calling his attendants<br/>
					or giving notice to the Order of brethren,<br/>
					alone and unattended,<br/>
					has gone forth a-wandering."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, when the Exalted One has set his own bed in order,<br/>
					taken bowl and robe,<br/>
					and without calling his attendants<br/>
					or giving notice to the Order of brethren,<br/>
					alone and unattended,<br/>
					has gone forth a-wandering,<br/>
					at such a time the Exalted One<br/>
					wishes to dwell alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such a time the Exalted One<br/>
					is not to be followed by anyone."</p>

					<p class="f4">So it came to pass<br/>
					that the Exalted One went wandering on<br/>
					and came to Pārileyya[ka],<br/>
					and there at Pārileyya[ka]<br/>
					the Exalted One dwelt at the foot of a lucky sal-tree.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of brethren<br/>
					came to the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					and held friendly converse with him,<br/>
					exchanged the courtesies of friendly talk<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					those brethren thus addressed the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tis a long time, friend Ānanda,<br/>
					since we had pious talk<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					face to face with the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">We desire, friend Ānanda,<br/>
					to hear a pious talk<br/>
					face to face with the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					went along with those brethren to Pārileyya<br/>
					to the lucky sal-tree<br/>
					where the Exalted One was dwelling,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus sat,<br/>
					the Exalted One instructed,<br/>
					calmed,<br/>
					aroused<br/>
					and composed those brethren<br/>
					with pious talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					this train of thought<br/>
					arose in a certain brother:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How knowing, how seeing, I wonder,<br/>
					can one without delay<br/>
					destroy the āsavas?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/>
					with his own thought<br/>
					reading the thought of that brother's mind,<br/>
					thus spake unto the brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, I have defined<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					and taught you the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have defined<br/>
					and taught you the four stations of mindfulness,<br/>
					likewise the right efforts,<br/>
					the four bases of magic power,<br/>
					the five controlling powers,<br/>
					the five strengths,<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have defined and taught you<br/>
					the Ariyan Eight- <span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span> fold Path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, brethren, have I defined<br/>
					and taught you the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet, brethren,<br/>
					in spite of this,<br/>
					in the mind of a certain brother here<br/>
					there has arisen this train of thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How knowing, how seeing, I wonder,<br/>
					can one without delay<br/>
					destroy the <i>āsavas?"</i></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, indeed, brethren,<br/>
					can one do so without delay?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the untaught many-folk,<br/>
					who discern not those that are Ariyans,<br/>
					who are unskilled in the Ariyan Norm,<br/>
					untrained in the Ariyan Norm,<br/>
					who discern not the worthy ones,<br/>
					who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine, -<br/>
					such regard body as the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This regarding is an activity,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					and this activity -<br/>
					how does it result,<br/>

					how is it born<br/>
					and how produced?</p>
