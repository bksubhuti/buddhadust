					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a></sup> Compare the suicide of Godhika, <i>S.</i> i, 119; <i>K.S.</i> i, 150. As often happens in the <i>Tipiṭaka,</i> the same story is told of different persons either in ignorance or to preserve the traditional framework free from too many details. Thus the introductory part of this story is a stock passage for describing the sick and their visiting. In the <i>Thag. Comy.</i> and <i>Dhp. A.</i> versions, Vakkali does not 'use the knife,' but rises up into the air at the call of the Master and attains arahantship on the way by an effort of self-control.</p>

The ethics of the deed are not discussed by <i>Comy.,</i> who says the elder was conceited and blind to his remaining faults; thought he was <i>khīnāsavo</i> and might rid himself of the bodily pain. However, the pain of the knife was such that, in the very moment of dying, realizing his state of <i>puthujjano</i> as imperfect, he made a great effort to attain and did so before actual death. <i>Comy.</i> adds, 'he died lying on his right side, as arahants generally do (the traditional posture of the Buddha, "on his right side, like a lion lying"), and in a decent posture.'</p>
