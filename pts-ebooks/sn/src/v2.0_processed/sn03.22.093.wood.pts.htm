					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose a stream, brethren,<br/>
					a mountain-torrent,<br/>
					down-drawing,<br/>
					rising from afar,<br/>
					swift-flowing,<br/>
					and on both its banks are growing<br/>
					grasses which overhang the stream,<br/>
					kusa-grass there might be that overhangs,<br/>
					reeds and creepers<br/>
					and over-hanging shrubs;<br/>
					and a man is swept away by that stream<br/>
					and clutches at the grasses,<br/>
					but they might break away,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					and owing to that<br/>
					he might come by his destruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">He might clutch at the kusa grass,<br/>
					at the reeds,<br/>
					at the creepers;<br/>
					he might clutch at the shrubs,<br/>
					but they might break away,<br/>
					and owing to that he might come by his destruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren,<br/>
					the untaught manyfolk,<br/>
					who discerns not those who are Ariyans;<br/>
					who is unskilled in the Ariyan Norm,<br/>
					untrained in the Ariyan Norm;<br/>
					who discerns not the worthy ones,<br/>
					who is unskilled in the worthy Norm,<br/>
					untrained in the worthy Norm,<br/>
					regard the body as the self,<br/>
					or the self as having body,<br/>
					or the body as being in the self,<br/>
					or the self as being in the body.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Then body breaks away,<br/>
					and owing to that<br/>
					they come by their destruction.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">They regard feeling as the self,<br/>
					or the self as having feeling,<br/>
					or feeling as being in the self,<br/>
					or the self as being in feeling.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Then feeling breaks away,<br/>
					and owing to that<br/>
					they come by their destruction.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">They regard perception as the self,<br/>
					or the self as having perception,<br/>
					or perception as being in the self,<br/>
					or the self as being in perception.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Then perception breaks away,<br/>
					and owing to that<br/>
					they come by their destruction.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">They regard the activities as the self,<br/>
					or the self as having the activities,<br/>
					or the activities as being in the self,<br/>
					or the self as being in the activities.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the activities break away,<br/>
					and owing to that<br/>
					they come by their destruction.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">They regard consciousness as the self,<br/>
