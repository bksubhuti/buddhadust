					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to ths Exalted One<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, is there any body<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any feeling<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any perception<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any activities<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any consciousness<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, brother, there is no material form<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no feeling<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no perception<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are no activities<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no consciousness<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One took up<br/>
					a little pellet of cowdung in his hand,<br/>
					and said to that brother:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even the getting of a selfhood<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					so small as this, brother,<br/>
					is not permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the getting of a selfhood<br/>
					so small as this, brother,<br/>
					were permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it would stand fast,<br/>
					then the living of the holy life<br/>
					for the best destruction of suffering<br/>
					would not be set forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch, brother,<br/>
					as there is no getting of a selfhood<br/>
					even so small as this,<br/>
					permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it would stand fast,<br/>
					therefore the living of the holy life<br/>
					for the best destruction of suffering<br/>
					is set forth.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Formerly, brother, I was a ruler,<br/>
					a noble crowned,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					and (as such) I had eighty thousand townships,<br/>
					chief of which <span class="f2 g"><b>[123]</b></span> was the royal town, Kusāvatī.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I was such, brother,<br/>
					I had eighty thousand palaces,<br/>
					chief of which was the Palace of Righteousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I had eighty thousand halls,<br/>
					chief of which tfas the Great Assembly Hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I had eighty thousand couches of solid ivory,<br/>
					of solid wood,<br/>
					of solid gold<br/>
					of solid silver,<br/>
					furnished with woollen draperies,<br/>
					with white draperies,<br/>
					with flower-worked coverlets<br/>
					and spread with choicest skins of antelopes,<br/>
					with canopies above<br/>
					and scarlet cushions at each end.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when I was such, brethren,<br/>
					I had four and eighty thousand elephants<br/>
					with trappings of gold<br/>
					and gilded harness,<br/>
					covered, with nets of gold thread,<br/>
					chief of which was the royal elephant called Sabbath.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand steeds,<br/>
					with trappings of gold<br/>
					and gilded banners,<br/>
					covered with nets of gold thread,<br/>
					chief of which was the royal steed Thundercloud.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand chariots,<br/>
					with trappings of gold<br/>
					and gilded banners,<br/>
					covered with nets of gold thread,<br/>
					chief which was the royal chariot The Conqueror.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand jewels,<br/>
					chief of which was the Gem.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand women,<br/>
					chief of whom was Queen of Good Fortune.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand vassals,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					chief of whom was the Crown Prince.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I had four and eighty thousand cows,<br/>
					with tethers of fine jute<br/>
					and silver milk-pails.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And I had four and eighty myriads of garments<br/>
					woven of finest flax,<br/>
					of finest silk,<br/>
					of finest wool,<br/>
					of finest cotton.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[124]</b></span> And I had four and eighty myriad vessels,<br/>
					in which both morning and evening<br/>
					rice food was served.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of those four and eighty thousand towns, brother,<br/>
					this town Kusāvatī<br/>
					was my royal residence in those days.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand palaces, brother,<br/>
					the Palace of Righteousness<br/>
					was where I dwelt in those days.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand halls,<br/>
					the Great Hall of Assembly<br/>
					was where I dwelt in those days.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand couches,<br/>
					the couch of solid ivory,<br/>
					of solid wood,<br/>
					of solid gold<br/>
					or of solid silver<br/>
					was the one which I enjoyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of the four and eighty thousand elephants,<br/>
					the royal elephant called Sabbath<br/>
					was the one I mounted in those days.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand steeds,<br/>
					my royal steed called Thundercloud<br/>
					was the one I mounted in those days.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand chariots,<br/>
					the chariot Conqueror<br/>
					was the one I mounted in those days.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of those four and eighty thousand women,<br/>
					Khattiyāni<br/>
					or Velamikā<br/>
					was the one who waited on me in those days.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of those four and eighty myriads of garments,<br/>
					one suit there was I donned in those days,<br/>
					made of finest flax,<br/>
					of finest silk,<br/>
					of finest wool,<br/>
					or of finest cotton.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of those four and eighty myriad vessels<br/>
					there was one from which I ate<br/>
					a measure of choicest rice<br/>
					and drank broth for seasoning thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus all those things of the world,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> brother,<br/>
					are past and gone<br/>
					and perished utterly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus impermanent, brother,<br/>
					are things of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus mutable, brother, are they.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus doomed to perish, brother,<br/>
					are they;<br/>
					insomuch that there is enough<br/>
					for disgust at all things of the world,<br/>
					enough to be averse from them,<br/>
					enough to be freed from them."</p>
