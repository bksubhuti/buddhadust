					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, is there any body<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any feeling<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any perception<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any activities<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any consciousness<br/>
					that is permanent,<br/>
					stable,<br/>
					by nature lasting,<br/>
					unchanging,<br/>
					like unto the eternal,<br/>
					so that thus it will stand fast?"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Suddhikaṇ</i> or <i>Samuddakaṇ</i>. The name of a section at  <i>S.</i> i, 165, so called after a fastidious brahmin, <i>Suddhiko.</i> But the subject of purity is not referred to here, and it is not clear why such a title is assigned. There is some confusion in the text between <i>suddhikaṇ</i> and <i>suddkakaṇ.</i> So at Bk. viii. <i>infra</i> we should read the former.</p>
