					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Incalculable,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> brethren, is the beginning<br/>
					of this round of rebirth.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">No beginning is made known<br/>
					of beings<br/>
					wrapt in ignorance,<br/>
					fettered by craving,<br/>
					who run on,<br/>
					who fare on the round of rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">There comes a time, brethren,<br/>
					when the mighty ocean dries up,<br/>
					is utterly drained,<br/>
					comes no more to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">But of beings hindered by ignorance,<br/>
					fettered by craving,<br/>
					who run on,<br/>
					who fare on the round of rebirth,<br/>
					I declare no end-making.</p>

					<p class="f4">There comes a time, brethren,<br/>
					when Sineru,<br/>
					monarch of mountains,<br/>
					is consumed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is destroyed,<br/>
					comes no more to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">But of beings hindered by ignorance,<br/>
					fettered by craving,<br/>
					who run for ever the round of rebirth,<br/>
					I declare no end-making.</p>
