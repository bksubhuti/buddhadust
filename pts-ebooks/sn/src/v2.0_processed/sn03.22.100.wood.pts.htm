					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Incalculable, brethren, is the beginning<br/>
					of this round of rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">No beginning is made known<br/>
					of beings<br/>
					wrapt in ignorance,<br/>
					fettered by craving,<br/>
					who run on,<br/>
					who fare on the round of rebirth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just like a dog, brethren,<br/>
					tied up by a leash to a strong stake or pillar -<br/>
					if he goes,<br/>
					he goes up to that stake or pillar;<br/>
					if he stands still,<br/>
					he stands close to that stake or pillar;<br/>
					if he squats down,<br/>
					he squats close to that stake or pillar;<br/>
					if he lies down,<br/>
					he lies dose to that stake or pillar.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren, the untaught manyfolk regard body (thus):|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine;<br/>
					this am I;<br/>
					this is the self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They regard feeling (thus):|| ||</p>
