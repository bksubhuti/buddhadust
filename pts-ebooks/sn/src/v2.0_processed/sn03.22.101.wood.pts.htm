					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"By knowing, brethren, by seeing<br/>
					is, I declare,<br/>
					the destruction of the <i>āsavas,</i><br/>
					not by not knowing,<br/>
					by not seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">And by knowing what, brethren,<br/>
					by seeing what,<br/>
					is there destruction of the <i>āsavas?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such is body,<br/>
					such is the arising of body,<br/>
					such is the ceasing of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">By thus knowing, brethren,<br/>
					by thus seeing<br/>
					is there destruction of the <i>āsavas.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"Such is feeling,<br/>
					such is the arising of feeling,<br/>
					such is the ceasing of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">By thus knowing, brethren,<br/>
					by thus seeing<br/>
					is there destruction of the <i>āsavas.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"Such is perception,<br/>
					such is the arising of perception,<br/>
					such is the ceasing of perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">By thus knowing, brethren,<br/>
					by thus seeing<br/>
					is there destruction of the <i>āsavas.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"Such are the activities,<br/>
					such is the arising of the activities,<br/>
					such is the ceasing of the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">By thus knowing, brethren,<br/>
					by thus seeing<br/>
					is there destruction of the <i>āsavas.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Such is consciousness,<br/>
					such is the arising of consciousness,<br/>
					such is the ceasing of consciousness."</p>

					<p class="f4">By thus knowing, brethren,<br/>
					by thus seeing<br/>
					is there destruction of the Ãsavas.</p>
