					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, I will teach you suffering,<br/>
					the arising of suffering,<br/>
					the ceasing of suffering,<br/>
					the way leading to the ceasing of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, is suffering?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is to be called the five grasping groups.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The body-grasping-group,<br/>
					the feeling-grasping-group,<br/>
					the perception-grasping-group,<br/>
					the the activities-grasping-group,<br/>
					the consciousness-grasping-group.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is called suffering.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, is the arising of  suffering?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is that craving which,<br/>
					accompanied by lure and lust,<br/>
					leads downward to rebirth,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

						

					<p class="f4">the craving for feeling,<br/>
					the craving for rebirth,<br/>
					the craving for no rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is called the arising of suffering.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, is the ceasing of suffering?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the utter passionless ceasing,<br/>
					the giving up,<br/>
					the abandonment of,<br/>
					the release from,<br/>
					the freedom from<br/>
					attachment to,<br/>
					that craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is called the ceasing of suffering.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren,<br/>
					is the way going to<br/>
					the ceasing of suffering?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span> Right view,<br/>
					right aims,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is called the way going to the ceasing of suffering."</p>
