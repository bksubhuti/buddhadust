					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever desire, brethren,<br/>
					whatsoever lust,<br/>
					whatsoever lure,<br/>
					whatsoever craving,<br/>
					whatsoever grasping after systems,<br/>
					addiction to dogma<br/>
					and mental bias there be<br/>
					concerning body, do ye abandon them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus will that body be abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like the stump of a palm tree,<br/>
					made something that has ceased to be,<br/>
					so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever desire, brethren,<br/>
					whatsoever lust,<br/>
					whatsoever lure,<br/>
					whatsoever craving,<br/>
					whatsoever grasping after systems,<br/>
					addiction to dogma<br/>
					and mental bias there be<br/>
					concerning feeling, do ye abandon that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus will that feeling be abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like the stump of a palm tree,<br/>
					made something that has ceased to be,<br/>
					so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever desire, brethren,<br/>
					whatsoever lust,<br/>
					whatsoever lure,<br/>
					whatsoever craving,<br/>
					whatsoever grasping after systems,<br/>
					addiction to dogma<br/>
					and mental bias there be<br/>
					concerning perception, do ye abandon that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus will that perception be abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like the stump of a palm tree,<br/>
					made something that has ceased to be,<br/>
					so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus will activities be abandoned,<br/>
					cut down at the root,<br/>
					made like the stump of a palm tree,<br/>
					made something that has ceased to be,<br/>
					so that it cannot grow up again in the future.</p>
