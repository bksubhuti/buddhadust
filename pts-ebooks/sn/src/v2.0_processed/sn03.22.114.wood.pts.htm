					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One<br/>
					and saluting him<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Wisdom, wisdom,' 'tis said, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, what is wisdom,<br/>
					and how far has one wisdom?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, brother, the well-taught Ariyan disciple  understands body,<br/>
					understands the arising of body,<br/>
					understands the ceasing of body,<br/>
					understands the way going to the ceasing of body.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands feeling,<br/>
					understands the arising of feeling,<br/>
					understands the ceasing of feeling,<br/>
					understands the way going to the ceasing of feeling.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands perception,<br/>
					understands the arising of perception,<br/>
					understands the ceasing of perception,<br/>
					understands the way going to the ceasing of perception.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands the activities,<br/>
					understands the arising of the activities,<br/>
					understands the ceasing of the activities,<br/>
					understands the way going to the ceasing of the activities.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands consciousness,<br/>
					understands the arising of consciousness,<br/>
					understands the ceasing of consciousness,<br/>
					understands the way going to the ceasing of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brother, is called wisdom,<br/>
					and thus far has one wisdom."</p>
