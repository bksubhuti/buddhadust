					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One<br/>
					and saluting him<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Norm-teacher, Norm-teacher,' is the saying, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">How far, lord, is one a Norm-teacher?</p>

					<p class="f4">How far is one a teacher of what conforms with the Norm?</p>

					<p class="f4">How far has a brother won Nibbāna?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a brother teaches a doctrine<br/>
					of revulsion from body,<br/>
					of its fading away,<br/>
					its ceasing,<br/>
					well may he be called<br/>
					'Norm-teacher,' brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a brother be apt<br/>
					for revulsion from body,<br/>
					for its fading away,<br/>
					its ceasing,<br/>
					well may he be called<br/>
					'one apt in teaching<br/>
					what conforms with the Norm.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If a brother,<br/>
					by revulsion from body<br/>
					be released from grasping<br/>
					by making it to fade away,<br/>
					by making it to cease,<br/>
					well may he be called<br/>
					'a brother who in this very life hath won Nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a brother teaches a doctrine<br/>
