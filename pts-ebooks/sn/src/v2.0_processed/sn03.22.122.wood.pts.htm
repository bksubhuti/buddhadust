					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					were staying at Benares,<br/>
					in Isipatana,<br/>
					in the Deer-Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					rising at eventide from his solitude,<br/>
					came to the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and saluting him<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					he thus addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					what are the conditions<br/>
					that should be pondered with method<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					by a virtuous brother?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The five grasping-groups, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					are the conditions<br/>
					which should be pondered with method<br/>
					by a virtuous brother,<br/>
					as being impermanent,<br/>
