					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita<br/>
					were staying at Benares,<br/>
					in Isipatana,<br/>
					in the Deer-Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					rising at eventide from his solitude,<br/>
					came to the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and saluting him<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					he thus addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					what are the conditions<br/>
					that should be pondered with method<br/>
					by a well-taught brother?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The five grasping-groups, friend Koṭṭhita,<br/>
					are the conditions<br/>
					which should be pondered with method<br/>
					by a well-taught brother,<br/>
					as being impermanent,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sick,<br/>
					as an imposthume,<br/>
					as a dart,<br/>
					as pain,<br/>
					as ill-health,<br/>
					as alien,<br/>
					as transitory,<br/>
					empty<br/>
					and soulless.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">What five groups?</p>

					<p class="f4">The group of body-grasping,<br/>
					the group of feeling-grasping,<br/>
					the group of perception-grasping,<br/>
					the group of activities-grasping,<br/>
					the group of consciousness-grasping.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">By a well-taught brother, friend Koṭṭhita, these five groups of grasping should be pondered with method,<br/>

					as pain,<br/>
					as ill-health,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, friend, it is possible for a well-taught brother<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
