					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Kappa,<br/>
					came to the Exalted One<br/>
					and saluting him<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					the venerable Kappa thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, how should one know,<br/>
					how should one see,<br/>
					so that in this body,<br/>
					with its consciousness<br/>
					as well as ia all external objects,<br/>
					he has no more thought of<br/>
					'I' and 'mine,'<br/>
					no leanings to conceit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever bodily form, Kappa,<br/>
					be it past,<br/>
					future<br/>
					or present,<br/>
					inward or outward,<br/>
					gross or subtle,<br/>
					low or high,<br/>
					far or near,<br/>
					whatsoever bodily form<br/>
					you see as it really is<br/>
					by perfect insight thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/>
					this am not I;<br/>
					this is not the self of me,'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever feeling, Kappa,<br/>
					be it past,<br/>
					future<br/>
					or present,<br/>
					inward or outward,<br/>
					gross or subtle,<br/>
					low or high,<br/>
					far or near,<br/>
					whatsoever bodily form<br/>
					you see as it really is<br/>
					by perfect insight thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br/>
					this am not I;<br/>
					this is not the self of me,'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever perception, Kappa,<br/>
					be it past,<br/>

					<p class="f4">-to you so knowing,<br/>
					so seeing, Kappa,<br/>
					in this body<br/>
					with its consciousness<br/>
