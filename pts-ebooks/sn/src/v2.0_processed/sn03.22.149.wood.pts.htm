					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being what, brethren,<br/>
					clinging to what,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					does one's own weal-and-woe arise?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					their guide,<br/>
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed if the meaning of these words<br/>
					should show itself in the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being a body, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to body,<br/>
					one's <span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span> own weal-and-woe arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being feeling, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to feeling,<br/>
					one's own weal-and-woe arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being perception, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to perception,<br/>
					one's own weal-and-woe arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being the activities, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to the activities,<br/>
					one's own weal-and-woe arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being consciousness, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to consciousness,<br/>
					one's own weal-and-woe arise.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that, what think ye, brethren?|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/>
					is it weal or woe?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/>
					woeful,<br/>
					by nature changeable —<br/>
					could one's own weal-and-woe arise<br/>
					without a clinging to that?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is feeling permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/>
					is it weal or woe?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/>
					woeful,<br/>
					by nature changeable —<br/>
					could one's own weal-and-woe arise<br/>
					without a clinging to that?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is perception permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/>
					is it weal or woe?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/>
					woeful,<br/>
					by nature changeable —<br/>

					without a clinging to that?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are the activities permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/>
					is it weal or woe?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/>
					woeful,<br/>
					by nature changeable —<br/>
					could one's own weal-and-woe arise<br/>
					without a clinging to that?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/>
					is it weal or woe?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/>

					could one's own weal-and-woe arise<br/>
					without a clinging to that?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore, brethren, he who thus sees<br/>
					conceives disgust at body,<br/>
					at feeling,<br/>
					at perception,<br/>
					at the activities,<br/>
					at consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being disgusted<br/>
					he is repelled by them;<br/>
					by that repulsion he is released;<br/>
					by that release he is set free;<br/>
					knowledge arises:<br/>
					in the freed man is the freed thing,<br/>
					and he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth;<br/>
					lived is the righteous life;<br/>
					done is the task;<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
