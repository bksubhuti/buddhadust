					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being what, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to what, adhering<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> to what<br/>
					does one hold the view:<br/>
					'This is mine;<br/>
					this am I;<br/>
					this is the self of me'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root<br/>
					their guide,<br/>
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed if the meaning of these words<br/>
					should show itself in the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being a body, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to body,<br/>
					depending on body,<br/>
					one holds the view:<br/>
					'This is mine;<br/>
					this am I;<br/>
					this is the self of me'.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being feeling, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to feeling,<br/>
					depending on feeling,<br/>
					one holds the view:<br/>
					'This is mine;<br/>
					this am I;<br/>
					this is the self of me'.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being perception, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to perception,<br/>
					depending on perception,<br/>
					one holds the view:<br/>
					'This is mine;<br/>
					this am I;<br/>
					this is the self of me'.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being the activities, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to the activities,<br/>
					depending on the activities,<br/>
					one holds the view:<br/>
					'This is mine;<br/>
					this am I;<br/>
					this is the self of me'.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being consciousness, brethren,<br/>
					by clinging to consciousness,<br/>
					depending on consciousness,<br/>
					one holds the view:<br/>
					'This is mine;<br/>
					this am I;<br/>
					this is the self of me'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that, what think ye, brethren?|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/>
					is it weal or woe?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/>
					woeful,<br/>
					unstable in nature,<br/>
					is it right to regard it thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine,<br/>
					this am I<br/>
					this is the Self of me?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is feeling permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are the activities permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/>
					is it weal or woe?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore, brethren, he who thus sees<br/>
					conceives disgust at body,<br/>
					at feeling,<br/>
					at perception,<br/>
					at the activities,<br/>
					at consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being disgusted<br/>
					he is repelled by them;<br/>
					by that repulsion he is released;<br/>
					by that release he is set free;<br/>
					knowledge arises:<br/>
					in the freed man is the freed thing,<br/>
					and he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth;<br/>
					lived is the righteous life;<br/>
					done is the task;<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
