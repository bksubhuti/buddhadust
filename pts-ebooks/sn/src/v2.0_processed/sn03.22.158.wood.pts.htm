					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Approaching the Exalted One he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord,<br/>
					if the Exalted One were to teach me a doctrine,<br/>
					hearing which from the Exalted One,<br/>
					I might dwell remote,<br/>
					strenuous,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and intent."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, what think you, Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br/>
					is it weal or woe?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Woe, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br/>
					woeful,<br/>
					unstable in nature,<br/>
					is it right to regard it thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine,<br/>
					this am I<br/>
					this is the Self of me?'"</p>
