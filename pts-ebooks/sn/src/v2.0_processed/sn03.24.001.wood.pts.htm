					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> says 'it is not winds that blow, but a wind-atom, they say' <i>(vāta-leso).</i> In reality the wind is fixed like a mountain peak. Nor does the water carry down sticks and straws, but a water-atom. The water is really immovable as a post or pillar. Perhaps a glimpse of the fact that, in a wave, not the water of itself moves. (It is reasonable to assume that a stock saying of some current theory is here quoted, not more irrational when pbilosophically explained than, say, Berkeley's view of matter, or Zeno's tortoise <i>Cf. e.g.</i> <i>infra,</i> p. 170.-(original)Ed.)</p>
