					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>
					<p class="f4">"Feelings, brethren, that arise from eye-contact, are impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feelings, brethren, that arise from ear-contact, are impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feelings, brethren, that arise from nose-contact, are impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feelings, brethren, that arise from tongue-contact, are impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feelings, brethren, that arise from body-contact, are impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feelings, brethren, that arise from mind-contact, are impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who has faith and confidence, brethren,<br/>
					in these doctrines,<br/>
					such an one is called</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walker in faith,<br/>
					one who enters on assurance of perfection,<br/>
