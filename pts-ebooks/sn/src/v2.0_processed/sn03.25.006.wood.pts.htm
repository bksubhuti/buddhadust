					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Perception of body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception of sound, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception of scent, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception of savour, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception of tangibles, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception of phenomena,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn2" href="#edn2">ed2</a></sup></span> brethren, is impermanent,<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> As with §2, Woodward translates <i>'rūpa'</i> as body, but what is being spoken of here are the objects of the senses and that would be 'visible objects' not just the body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a></sup> <i>'Dhammā'</i>. Here Woodward changes his translation from 'state of mind' which he used in §2.</p>
