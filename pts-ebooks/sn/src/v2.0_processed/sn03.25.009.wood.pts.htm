					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The element of earth, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of water, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of heat, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of air, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of space, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of consciousness, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					changeable,<br/>
					becoming otherwise.</p>
