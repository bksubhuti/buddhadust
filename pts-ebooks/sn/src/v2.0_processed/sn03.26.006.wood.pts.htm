					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Here Woodward has apparently mistakenly used 'consciousness' for 'perception.' This must be just a careless oversight as he uses 'perception' for the title, 'consciousness' for §3 here and 'perception' for §6 in the previous set. Doubt remains however because he has again repeated this translation in SN 3.27.6 and there has changed his translation of <i>'rūpa'</i> to 'visible shape' which means he must have at least looked at his translation. I have changed the translation or corrected the mistake because it is pretty much a consensus opinion that the translation is 'perception.' See Glossology: <i>Saññā</i></p>
