					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, the arising,<br/>
					the establishing,<br/>
					the rebirth,<br/>
					the appearing of volitional acts through body, -<br/>
					this is the arising of suffering,<br/>
					the establishing of diseases,<br/>
					the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

					<p class="f4">The arising,<br/>
					the establishing,<br/>
					the rebirth,<br/>
					the appearing of volitional acts through sounds, -<br/>
					this is the arising of suffering,<br/>
					the establishing of diseases,<br/>
					the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

					<p class="f4">The arising,<br/>
					the establishing,<br/>
					the rebirth,<br/>
					the appearing of volitional acts through scents, -<br/>

					<p class="f4">The arising,<br/>
					the establishing,<br/>
					the rebirth,<br/>
					the appearing of volitional acts through savours, -<br/>
					this is the arising of suffering,<br/>
					the establishing of diseases,<br/>
					the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

					<p class="f4">The arising,<br/>
					the establishing,<br/>
					the rebirth,<br/>
					the appearing of volitional acts through tangibles, -<br/>
					this is the arising of suffering,<br/>
					the establishing of diseases,<br/>
					the appearing of decay-and-death.</p>

					<p class="f4">The arising,<br/>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, brethren, the ceasing,<br/>
					the calming,<br/>
					the coming to an end of volitional acts through body, -<br/>
					that is the ceasing of suffering,<br/>
					the calming of disease,<br/>
					the coming to an end of decay-and-death.</p>
