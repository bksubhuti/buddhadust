					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, the desire-and-lust for craving for visible shape<br/>
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust for<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> craving for sound<br/>
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust for craving for scent<br/>
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust for craving for savour<br/>
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust for craving for tangibles<br/>
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust for craving for things<br/>
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, brethren, when in a brother<br/>
					the heart's corruption<br/>
					in these six points<br/>
					is put away,<br/>
					and his heart is bent on renunciation,<br/>
					then, compassed about with renunciation,<br/>
					his heart is seen to be pliable<br/>
					for penetrating those things<br/>
					that are to be realized."</p>
