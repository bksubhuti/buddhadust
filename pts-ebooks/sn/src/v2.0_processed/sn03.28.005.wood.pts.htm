					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					rising at early dawn,<br/>
					robed himself,<br/>
					took bowl and robe<br/>
					and entered Sāvatthī to beg for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">After going his begging-rounds in Sāvatthī<br/>
					and returning from begging<br/>
					he ate his meal<br/>
					and drew near Dark Grove<br/>
					for noonday rest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Plunging into Dark Grove,<br/>
					he sat down at the foot of a tree<br/>
					for noonday rest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					rising at eventide from his solitude,<br/>
					went to Jeta Grove<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					saw the venerable Sāriputta coming,<br/>
					while yet he was far off,<br/>
					and beholding the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					he thus spake to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Calm are your senses, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					clear and translucent<br/>
					the colour of your face.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what mood<br/>
					has the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					been spending this day?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, passing utterly beyond<br/>
					the consciousness of shape and form,<br/>
					by the ending of the consciousness of resistance,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					by not attending to the consciousness of diversity,<br/>
					I have attained<br/>
					and have been dwelling in the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br/>
					'Infinite is space.'</p>

					<p class="f4">To me thus, friend,<br/>
					the thought never came:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br/>
					who am attaining the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br/>
					"Infinite is space."'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br/>
					who have attained the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br/>
					"Infinite is space."'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br/>
					who have emerged from the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br/>
					"Infinite is space."'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely for a long time<br/>
					have leanings to I-making,<br/>
					to mine-making<br/>
					and to vanity<br/>
					been well rooted out from the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why it occurs not<br/>
					to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br/>
					who am attaining the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br/>
					"Infinite is space."'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br/>
					who have attained the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br/>
					"Infinite is space."'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br/>
					who have emerged from the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br/>
					"Infinite is space."'"</p>
