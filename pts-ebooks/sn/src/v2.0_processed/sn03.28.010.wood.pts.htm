					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					rising up at early dawn,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span> robed himself,<br/>
					and taking bowl and robe<br/>
					entered Rājagaha to beg for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">After begging straight on<br/>
					from house to house<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in Rājagaha<br/>
					he was eating his meal,<br/>
					leaning against a certain wall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wandering sister Pure-Face<br/>
					came up to the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and addressed him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"0 recluse, why do you eat looking downwards?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do nñt eat looking downwards, sister."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, recluse, you are eating looking upwards."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not eat looking upwards, sister."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the four quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not eat looking to the four quarters, sister."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the points between the four quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not eat, sister, looking to the points between the four quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then how, forsooth, how are you eating, recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">For when I question you<br/>
					'0 recluse, why do you eat looking downwards?'<br/>
					you answer:<br/>
					'I do nñt eat looking downwards, sister.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When I question you<br/>
					'Then, recluse, you are eating looking upwards.'<br/>
					you answer:<br/>
					'I do not eat looking upwards, sister.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When I question you<br/>
					'Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the four quarters.'<br/>
					you answer:<br/>
					'I do not eat looking to the four quarters, sister.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When I question you<br/>
					'Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the points between the four quarters.'<br/>
					you answer:<br/>
					'I do not eat, sister, looking to the points between the four quarters.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br/>
					get their living in a wrong way<br/>
					by the practice of divination<br/>
					and of such low arts, -<br/>
					these, sister, are called<br/>
					'recluses and brahmins who eat looking downwards.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br/>
					get their living in a wrong way<br/>
					by the practice of star-gazing<br/>
					and such low arts,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					such as these, sister, are called<br/>
					'recluses and brahmins who eat looking upward.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br/>
					get their living in a wrong way<br/>
					by the practice of sending messages<br/>
					and going errands,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					such as these, sister, are called<br/>
					'recluses and brahmins who eat looking to the four quarters.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span> Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br/>
					get their living in a wrong way<br/>
					by the practice of palmistry<br/>
					and such low arts, -<br/>
					these, sister, are called<br/>
					'recluses and brahmins who eat looking to the points between the four quarters.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But I, sister, am one who gets his living<br/>
					in no one of these ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rightly do I seek my food,<br/>
					and rightly do I eat my food<br/>
					when I have sought it."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the wanderer Pure-Face<br/>
					roamed from street to street<br/>
					and from crossways to crossways<br/>
					in Rājagaha<br/>
					and thus proclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rightly do the recluses<br/>
					who are sons of the Sakyan<br/>
					win their food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Blamelessly do the recluses<br/>
					who are sons of the Sakyan<br/>
					win their food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye give alms<br/>
					to the recluses<br/>
					who are sons of the Sakyan."</p>
