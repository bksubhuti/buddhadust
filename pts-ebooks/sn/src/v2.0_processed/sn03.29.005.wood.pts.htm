					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One, and saluting him<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the reason, lord,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why some sweat-born <i>nāgas</i> keep the Sabbath<br/>
					and divest themselves of their <i>nāga</i>-forms?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, brother, certain sweat-born <i>nāgas</i> think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Formerly we were double-dealing in speech,<br/>
					double-dealing in act,<br/>
					double-dealing in thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus in three ways being double-dealers,<br/>
					when body breaks up after death<br/>
					we shall be reborn in the company of sweat-born <i>nāgas.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Now if we were to practise virtuous deeds,<br/>
					virtuous words<br/>
					and virtuous thoughts,<br/>
					when body breaks up after death<br/>
					we might be reborn in the happy state,<br/>
					in the heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now,<br/>
					let us practise virtuous deeds,<br/>
					virtuous words<br/>
					and virtuous thoughts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is the reason,<br/>
					this is the cause<br/>
					why certain sweat-born <i>nāgas</i><br/>
					keep the Sabbath<br/>
					and divest themselves of their <i>nāga</i>-forms."</p>
