					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br/>
					and saluting him<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the reason, lord,<br/>
					what is the cause<br/>
					why a certain one,<br/>
					when body breaks up after death<br/>
					is reborn in the company of the womb-born nagas?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, brother, a certain one is<br/>
					a double-dealer in act,<br/>
					a double-dealer in word<br/>
					a double-dealer in thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The womb-born <i>nāgas</i> are long-lived,<br/>
					fair to see<br/>
					and have much happiness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 that when body breaks up after death<br/>
					I might be born in the company<br/>
					of the womb-born <i>nāgas</i>!'</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br/>
					a double-dealer in act,<br/>
					a double-dealer in word<br/>
					a double-dealer in thought<br/>
					is born in the company<br/>
					of the womb-born <i>nāgas</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the reason, brother,<br/>
					this is the cause<br/>
					why a certain one,<br/>
					when body breaks up after death<br/>
					is reborn in the company of the womb-born <i>nāgas."</i></p>
