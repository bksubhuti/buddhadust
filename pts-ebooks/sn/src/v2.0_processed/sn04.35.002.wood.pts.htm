					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The eye, brethren,<br/>
					is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine:<br/>
					I am not it:<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					with perfect insight<br/>
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine:<br/>
					I am not it:<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					with perfect insight<br/>
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine:<br/>
					I am not it:<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					with perfect insight<br/>
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine:<br/>
					I am not it:<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					with perfect insight<br/>
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The body is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine:<br/>
					I am not it:<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					with perfect insight<br/>
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br/>
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br/>
					that is not mine:<br/>
					I am not it:<br/>
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br/>
					with perfect insight<br/>
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br/>
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is repelled by eye,<br/>
					ear,<br/>
					nose,<br/>
					tongue,<br/>
					body,<br/>
					and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled by them,<br/>
					he lusts not for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not lusting,<br/>
					he is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this freedom<br/>
					comes insight of being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
