					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The eye, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for an eye that is past,<br/>
					is not in love with an eye to be,<br/>
					and, for the present eye,<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for an ear that is past,<br/>
					is not in love with an ear to be,<br/>
					and, for the present ear,<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for a nose that is past,<br/>
					is not in love with a nose to be,<br/>
					and, for the present nose,<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for a tongue that is past,<br/>
					is not in love with a tongue to be,<br/>
					and, for the present tongue,<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The body,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for a body that is past,<br/>
					is not in love with a body to be,<br/>
					and, for the present body,<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind, brethren, is impermanent,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for a mind that is past,<br/>
