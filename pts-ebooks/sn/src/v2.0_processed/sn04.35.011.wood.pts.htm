					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Objects, brethren, are ill,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for an object that is past,<br/>
					is not in love with an object to be,<br/>
					and, for a present object,<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds, brethren, are ill,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for a sound that is past,<br/>
					is not in love with a sound to be,<br/>
					and, for a present sound,<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Scents, brethren, are ill,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for a scent that is past,<br/>
					is not in love with a scent to be,<br/>
					and, for a present scent,<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Savours, brethren, are ill,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for a savour that is past,<br/>
					is not in love with a savour to be,<br/>
					and, for a present savour,<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for it,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Things tangible, brethren, are ill,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					cares not for things tangible that are past,<br/>
					is not in love with things tangible to be,<br/>
					and, for the present things tangible,<br/>
					seeks to be repelled by them,<br/>
					seeks dispassion for them,<br/>
					seeks the ceasing of them.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Mind-states, brethren, are ill,<br/>
					both in the past and in the future,<br/>
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
