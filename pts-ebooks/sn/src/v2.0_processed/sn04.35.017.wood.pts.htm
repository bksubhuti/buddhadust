					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the eye,<br/>
					beings would not lust after the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the eye,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to the eye,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in the eye,<br/>
					beings are repelled by the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from the eye,<br/>
					beings could not escape from the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from the eye,<br/>
					beings do escape from the eye.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the ear,<br/>
					beings would not lust after the ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the ear,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after the ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to the ear,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by the ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in the ear,<br/>
					beings are repelled by the ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from the ear,<br/>
					beings could not escape from the ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from the eye,<br/>
					beings do escape from the ear.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the nose,<br/>
					beings would not lust after the nose.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the nose,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after the nose.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to the nose,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by the nose.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in the nose,<br/>
					beings are repelled by the ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from the nose,<br/>
					beings could not escape from the nose.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from the nose,<br/>
					beings do escape from the nose.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the tongue,<br/>
					beings would not lust after the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the tongue,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to the tongue,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in the tongue,<br/>
					beings are repelled by the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from the tongue,<br/>
					beings could not escape from the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from the tongue,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the body,<br/>
					beings would not lust after the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the body,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to the body,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So long, Brethren, as beings have not understood,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					the satisfaction as such,<br/>
					the misery as such,<br/>
					the way of escape as such,<br/>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span> But so soon, Brethren, as beings thoroughly understand,<br/>

					the satisfaction as such,<br/>
					the misery as such,<br/>

					then, Brethren, beings
