					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from objects,<br/>
					beings would not lust after objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in objects,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to objects,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in objects,<br/>
					beings are repelled by objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from objects,<br/>
					beings could not escape from objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from objects,<br/>
					beings do escape from objects.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from sounds,<br/>
					beings would not lust after sounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in sounds,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after sounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to sounds,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by sounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in sounds,<br/>
					beings are repelled by sounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from sounds,<br/>
					beings could not escape from sounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from sounds,<br/>
					beings do escape from sounds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from scents,<br/>
					beings would not lust after scents.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in scents,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after scents.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to scents,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by scents.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in scents,<br/>
					beings are repelled by scents.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from scents,<br/>
					beings could not escape from scents.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from scents,<br/>
					beings do escape from scents.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from savours,<br/>
					beings would not lust after savours.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in savours,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after savours.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to savours,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by savours.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in savours,<br/>
					beings are repelled by savours.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from savours,<br/>
					beings could not escape from savours.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from savours,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from things tactile,<br/>
					beings would not lust after things tactile.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in things tactile,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after things tactile.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to things tactile,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from mind-states,<br/>
					beings would not lust after mind-states.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in mind-states,<br/>
					therefore beings lust after mind-states.</p>

					<p class="f4">If misery, Brethren, pertained not to mind-states,<br/>
					beings would not be repelled by mind-states.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is misery in mind-states,<br/>
					beings are repelled by mind-states.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were no way of escape from mind-states,<br/>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is a way of escape from mind-states,<br/>
					beings do escape from mind-states.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So long, Brethren, as beings have not understood,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					the satisfaction as such,<br/>
					the misery as such,<br/>
					the way of escape as such,<br/>
					in this sixfold external sphere of sense,<br/>
					so long, Brethren, beings have not remained aloof,<br/>
					detached,<br/>
					separated,<br/>
					with the barriers to the mind nor have the world<br/>
					and its devas,<br/>
					its <i>Māras,</i><br/>
					its Brahmas,<br/>
					nor the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					of devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But so soon, Brethren, as beings thoroughly understand,<br/>
					as they really are<br/>
					the satisfaction as such,<br/>
					the misery as such,<br/>
					the way of escape as such,<br/>
					in this sixfold external sphere of sense,<br/>
					then, Brethren, beings
					and the world<br/>
					and its devas,<br/>
					its <i>Māras,</i><br/>
					its Brahmas,<br/>
					and the host of recluses and brahmins,<br/>
					of devas and mankind<br/>
					do remain aloof,<br/>
					detached,<br/>
					separated,<br/>
					with the barriers to the mind done away with."</p>
