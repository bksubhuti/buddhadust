					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will show you, Brethren, a teaching<br/>
					for the exhausting of all attachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is that teaching for the exhausting of all attachment?</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on the eye and object<br/>
					arises eye-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The union of these three is contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on contact is feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is repelled by the eye,<br/>
					is repelled by objects,<br/>
					is repelled by eye-consciousness,<br/>
					is repelled by eye-contact,<br/>
					is repelled by feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled by them<br/>
					he lusts not for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not lusting<br/>
					he is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">By freedom he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Attachment has been comprehended by me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on the ear and sounds<br/>
					arises ear-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The union of these three is contact.</p>
