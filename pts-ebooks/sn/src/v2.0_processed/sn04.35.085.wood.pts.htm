					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to see the Exalted One,<br/>

					saluted him<br/>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Void<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> is the world! Void is the world!' is the saying, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray how far, lord, does this saying go?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Because the world is void of the self, Ānanda,<br/>
					or of what belongs to the self,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span>
					therefore is it said<br/>
					'Void is the world.'</p>
