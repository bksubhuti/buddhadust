					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> For Mālunkya's Son (Text has <i>Mālukya,</i> but <i>Comy.</i> <i>Māluinkya</i>) see Brethren, 212; <i>M.</i> 1, § 63; A. ii, 248. Again, at <i>Brethren,</i> 307, the stanzas summing up the teaching of the present section are given in full. Mrs. Rhys Davids has given so fine a rendering of them that I have ventured to include them here instead of my own.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> As in the passage at A. ii, 248, where he is given a teaching on <i>taṇhā,</i> <i>Comy.</i> says this brother had in his youth neglected the detailed teaching and fallen back. Yet now he asks for a comprehensive view of it. How can such a practice be advised to the young? The Master speaks thus both to depreciate and encourage him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <i>Dāyāda.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>supra.</i> § 87. That is, birth in this world, or that beyond, or the intermediate state: as you will have no grounds for <i>rāga, dosa, moha.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Here Malunkya's Son sums up the teaching, just given, in verses of his own, which the Master repeats with approval. In the last stanza of the English version, as in the second, the separate verses of the Pali are combined. [Ed. here unabridged.]</p>
