					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to visit the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">After the exchange of greetings and friendly courtesies<br/>
					he sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					that brother thus addressed the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta, my fellow-lodger<br/>
					has renounced the training<br/>
					and gone back to the lower life."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"So it happens, friend,<br/>
					with one the door of whose faculties is unguarded,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					who is immoderate in eating,<br/>
					and not given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That brother, friend,<br/>
					is of such a nature.</p>

						

					<p class="f4">So long as he lives<br/>
					it will be impossible for him to apply himself<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					to the righteous life<br/>
					in all its fullness,<br/>
					in all its purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, friend, a brother,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					the door of whose faculties is guarded,<br/>
					who is moderate in eating<br/>
					and given to watchfulness, -<br/>
					for such an one,<br/>
					so long as he lives,<br/>
					it is possible to apply himself<br/>
					to the righteous life<br/>
					in all its fullness,<br/>
					in all its purity.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, friend, has one<br/>
					the door of his faculties guarded?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a brother, seeing an object with the eye,<br/>
					is not misled by its outer view,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					evil,<br/>
					unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one who dwells<br/>
					with the faculty of eye uncontrolled,<br/>
					he applies himself to such control,<br/>
					sets a guard over the faculty of eye,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears a sound with the ear,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And how, friend, is one moderate in eating?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friend, a brother takes his food thoughtfully<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> and prudently,<br/>
					not for sport,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					not for indulgence,<br/>
					not for personal charm or adornment,<br/>
					but just enough for the support<br/>

					to allay its pains,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					to help the practice of the righteous life,<br/>
					with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My former feeling I check,<br/>
					and set going no new feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">So shall I keep going,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span><br/>
					be blameless,<br/>
					and live at ease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, friend, is one moderate in eating.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, friend, is one given to watchfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friend, by day<br/>
					a brother walks up and down<br/>
					and then sits,<br/>
					and thus cleanses his heart<br/>
					from states that may hinder.</p>

					<p class="f4">By night, for the first watch<br/>
					a brother walks up and down<br/>
					and then sits,<br/>
					and thus cleanses his heart<br/>
					from states that may hinder.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night,<br/>
					lying on his right side<br/>
					he takes up the lion-posture,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
					resting one foot on the other,<br/>
					and thus collected and composed<br/>
					fixes his thought on rising up again.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the last watch of the night,<br/>
					at early dawn,<br/>
					he walks up and down,<br/>
					and then sits,<br/>
					and so cleanses his heart<br/>
					from states that may hinder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, friend, is one given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, friend, thus should you train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will be watchful over our faculties,<br/>
					moderate in eating<br/>
					and given to watchfulness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, friend, must you train yourself."</p>
