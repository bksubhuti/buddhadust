					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Piṇḍola,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of Bhāradvāja,<br/>

					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the rājah Udena said to him: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the condition, Master Bhāradvāja,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
