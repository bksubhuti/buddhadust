					<p><span class="f2">[121]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Udāyin<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> was staying at Kāmaṇḍāya,<br/>
					in the mango grove of the brahmin Todeyya.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a young fellow,<br/>
					a resident pupil of the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br/>
					came to visit the venerable Udāyin,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br/>
					the venerable Udāyin taught,<br/>
					established,<br/>
					roused,<br/>
					and made that lad happy with a pious talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he, being thus taught,<br/>
					established,<br/>
					roused<br/>
					and made happy<br/>
					by the pious talk of the venerable Udāyin,<br/>
					went to the <span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span> brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br/>
					and on coming to her said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would have my lady know<br/>
					that Udāyin, the recluse, is teaching a doctrine<br/>
					that is lovely in its beginning,<br/>
					lovely in its middle,<br/>
					and lovely in its ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sets forth the righteous life,<br/>
					fully perfected and purified,<br/>
					both in its spirit and in its form."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, my lad,<br/>
					in my name do you invite Udāyin, the recluse,<br/>
					for to-morrow's meal."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lady," replied the lad,<br/>
					and in obedience to the lady's bidding<br/>
					went back to the venerable Udāyin and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the worthy Udāyin accept a teacher's fee from us,<br/>
					to-morrow's food from the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Udāyin accepted by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Udāyin,<br/>
					when that night was past,<br/>
					robed himself at early dawn,<br/>
					and taking bowl and robe<br/>
					went to the dwelling<br/>
					of the brahmin lady of the Vetahaccani clan,<br/>
					and sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin lady served the venerable Udāyin<br/>
					with choice food,<br/>
					both hard and soft,<br/>
					with her own hands,<br/>
					until he had eaten his fill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when she saw<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> that the venerable Udāyin had finished<br/>
					and withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br/>
					she put on her sandals,<br/>
					sat down on a high seat,<br/>
					veiling her head,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> and thus addressed the venerable Udāyin:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Preach me doctrine, O recluse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"A time will come for that, sister," said he,<br/>
					rose from his seat and went away.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br/>
					that young fellow visited the venerable Udāyin,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br/>
					the venerable Udāyin taught,<br/>
					established,<br/>
					roused,<br/>
					and made that lad happy with a pious talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time he, being thus taught,<br/>
					established,<br/>
					roused<br/>
					and made happy<br/>
					by the pious talk of the venerable Udāyin,<br/>
					went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[79]</b></span> and on coming to her said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would have my lady know<br/>
					that Udāyin, the recluse, is teaching a doctrine<br/>
					that is lovely in its beginning,<br/>
					lovely in its middle,<br/>
					and lovely in its ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sets forth the righteous life,<br/>
					fully perfected and purified,<br/>
					both in its spirit and in its form."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You are speaking thus, my lad,<br/>
					in praise of the recluse Udāyin.</p>

					<p class="f4">But (on the former occasion) when I said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Preach me doctrine, O recluse,' he replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A time will come for that, sister,'<br/>
					rose from his seat and went to his lodging."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, my lady,<br/>
					you put on your sandals,<br/>
					sat down on a high seat,<br/>
					veiled your head<br/>
					and spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Preach me doctrine, O recluse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now they honour the doctrine,<br/>
					those worthy ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">They respect the doctrine."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well then, my lad.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you invite Udāyin, the recluse,<br/>
					in my name<br/>
					for to-morrow's meal."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, my lady," replied the lad<br/>
					and in obedience to the lady's bidding<br/>
					went back to the venerable Udāyin and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the worthy Udāyin accept a teacher's fee from us,<br/>
					to-morrow's food from the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Udāyin accepted by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Udāyin,<br/>
					when that night was past,<br/>
					robed himself at early dawn,<br/>
					and taking bowl and robe<br/>
					went to the dwelling<br/>
					of the brahmin lady of the Vetahaccani clan,<br/>
					and sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin lady served the venerable Udāyin<br/>
					with choice food,<br/>
					both hard and soft,<br/>
					with her own hands,<br/>
					until he had eaten his fill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br/>
					when she saw that the venerable Udāyin had finished<br/>
					and removed his hand from the bowl,<br/>
					put off her sandals,<br/>
					sat down on a low seat,<br/>
					unveiled her head<br/>
					and thus addressed the venerable Udāyin: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir,<br/>
					owing to the existence of what<br/>
					do the Arahants point out weal and woe?</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the existence of what<br/>
					do they not do so?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"When there is eye, sister,<br/>
					the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">When eye exists not, sister,<br/>
					the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is ear, sister,<br/>
					the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">When ear exists not, sister,<br/>
					the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is tongue, sister,<br/>
					the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">When tongue exists not, sister,<br/>
					the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is body, sister,<br/>
					the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body exists not, sister,<br/>
					the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is mind, sister,<br/>
					the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">When mind exists not, sister,<br/>
					the Arahants do not point out weal and woe."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan<br/>
					said to the venerable Udāyin: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br/>
					or shows forth what is hidden,<br/>
					or points out the way<br/>
					to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or holds up a light in the darkness<br/>
					so that he who has eyes may see objects, -<br/>
					even so in divers ways<br/>
					has the Norm been set forth by the worthy Udāyin.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, master Udāyin,<br/>
					do go for refuge to that Exalted One,<br/>
					to the Norm<br/>
					and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Udāyin<br/>
					regard me as a lay-disciple who,<br/>
					from this day forth<br/>
					so long as life shall last,<br/>
					has so taken refuge."</p>
