					<p><span class="f2">[124]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[80]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakkas at Devadaha,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					a township of the Sakkas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not declare, Brethren,<br/>
					that for all brothers<br/>
					there is need to strive earnestly<br/>
					in respect of the sixfold sphere of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet do I not declare<br/>
					that for all brothers<br/>
					there is no need so to strive earnestly<br/>
					in respect of the sixfold sphere of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those brethren who are Arahants,<br/>
					destroyers of the <i>āsavas,</i><br/>
					who have lived the life,<br/>
					done the task,<br/>
					removed the burden,<br/>
					who have won their own highest good,<br/>
					utterly destroyed the fetters of becoming,<br/>
					who by right insight<br/>
					have become free, -<br/>
					for such, Brethren, I declare<br/>
					that in respect of the sixfold sphere of sense<br/>
					there is no need to strive earnestly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they have wrought so earnestly<br/>
					as to be incapable of carelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But those brothers who are yet earnest-minded pupils,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					who dwell aspiring<br/>
					for the security that is unsurpassed, -<br/>
					by those brothers I declare<br/>
					that in respect of the sixfold sphere of sense<br/>
					there is need to strive earnestly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Brethren,<br/>
					there are objects cognizable by the eye,<br/>
					objects delightful or repulsive.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though they touch the heart again and again,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					yet they cannot altogether lay hold of it<br/>
					and so persist.</p>

					<p class="f4">By their failure to lay hold of the heart<br/>
					comes strenuous energy unquailing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindfulness is set up untroubled.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body is calmed,<br/>
					not perturbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">The heart is collected,<br/>
					one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing this fruit of earnestness, Brethren,<br/>
					I declare that such brothers<br/>
					do need to strive earnestly<br/>
					in respect of the sixfold sphere of sense.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">There are sounds cognizable by the ear,<br/>
					objects delightful or repulsive.</p>
