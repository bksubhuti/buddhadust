					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is not of you, Brethren, put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is not of you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Objects, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Scents, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Savours, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Tangibles, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Mind-objects, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, Brethren, a man should gather,<br/>
					burn<br/>
					or do what he likes<br/>
					with all the grass,<br/>
					all the sticks,<br/>
					branches<br/>
					and stalks in this Jeta Grove,<br/>
					pray would he say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This man is gathering,<br/>
					is burning us,<br/>
					doing what he pleases with us'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Because, lord, this is not our self,<br/>
					nor of the nature of self."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, objects are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Mind-states, Brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>
