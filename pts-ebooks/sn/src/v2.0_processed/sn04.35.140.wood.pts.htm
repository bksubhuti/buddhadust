					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakkas at Devadaha,<br/>
					a township of the Sakkas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The eye, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/>
					whatever cause there be<br/>
					for the appearance of the eye,<br/>
					that also is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/>
					the eye has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">How could the eye be pleasant?|| ||</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ear, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/>
					whatever cause there be<br/>
					for the appearance of the ear,<br/>
					that also is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/>
					the ear has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">How could the ear be pleasant?|| ||</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"The nose, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/>
					whatever cause there be<br/>
					for the appearance of the nose,<br/>
					that also is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/>
					the nose has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">How could the nose be pleasant?|| ||</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"The tongue, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/>
					whatever cause there be<br/>
					for the appearance of the tongue,<br/>
					that also is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/>
					the tongue has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">How could the tongue be pleasant?|| ||</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"The body, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/>
					whatever cause there be<br/>
					for the appearance of the body,<br/>
					that also is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/>
					the body has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">How could the body be pleasant?|| ||</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"The mind, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br/>
					whatever cause there be<br/>
					for the appearance of the mind,<br/>
					that also is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to suffering<br/>
					the mind has come into being, brethren.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">How could the mind be pleasant?|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is repelled by the eye,<br/>
					is repelled by objects,<br/>
					is repelled by eye-consciousness,<br/>
					is repelled by eye-contact,<br/>
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is repelled by the tongue,<br/>
					is repelled by savours,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is repelled by the mind,<br/>
					is repelled by mind-states,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled by these,<br/>
					he lusts not for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not lusting he is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this freedom<br/>
					comes insight<br/>
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is the task.</p>

					<p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
