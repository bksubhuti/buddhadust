					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, Brethren, action<br/>
					both new and old,<br/>
					the ceasing of action<br/>
					and the way leading to the ceasing of action.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your minds and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is action that is old?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye, Brethren, is to be viewed<br/>
					as action that is old,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					brought about<br/>
					and intentionally done,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear, Brethren, is to be viewed<br/>
					as action that is old,<br/>
					brought about<br/>
					and intentionally done,<br/>
					as a base for feeling.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose, Brethren, is to be viewed<br/>

					brought about<br/>
					and intentionally done,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue, Brethren, is to be viewed<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The body, Brethren, is to be viewed<br/>

					brought about<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind, Brethren, is to be viewed as action that is old,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And what is action that is new?</p>

					<p class="f4">The action one performs now, Brethren,<br/>
					by body,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and mind, -<br/>
					that is called<br/>
					'action that is new.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is<br/>
					the ceasing of action?</p>

					<p class="f4">That ceasing of action by body,<br/>
					speech<br/>
					and mind,<br/>
					by which one contacts freedom, -<br/>
					that is called<br/>
					'the ceasing of action.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is<br/>
					the way leading to the ceasing of action?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right View,<br/>
					Right Intention,<br/>
					Right Speech,<br/>
					Right Doing,<br/>
					Right Living,<br/>
					Right Effort,<br/>
					Right Mindfulness,<br/>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Brethren, is called<br/>
					'the way leading to the ceasing of action.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Brethren, have I taught you<br/>
					action that is old<br/>
					and action that is new.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have taught you<br/>
					the ceasing of action<br/>
					and the way leading to the ceasing of action.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever, Brethren, should be done by a teacher<br/>
					out of compassion,<br/>
					for the profit of his disciples,<br/>
					that have I done,<br/>
					taking pity on you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are the roots of trees, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are lonely places to dwell in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not remiss, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not regretful hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is our instruction to you."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
