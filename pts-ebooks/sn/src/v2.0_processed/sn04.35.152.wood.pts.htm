					<p><span class="f2">[138]</span> <span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is there, Brethren, any method,<br/>
					by following which<br/>
					a brother, apart from belief,<br/>
					apart from inclination,<br/>
					apart from hearsay,<br/>
					apart from argument as to method,<br/>
					apart from reflection on reasons,<br/>
					apart from delight in speculation,<br/>
					could affirm insight, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ended is birth,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have their root in the Exalted One,<br/>
					their guide,<br/>
					their resort.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br/>
					if the meaning of this that has been spoken<br/>
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/>
					the brethren will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is indeed a method, Brethren,<br/>
					by following which<br/>
					a brother, apart from belief,<br/>
					apart from inclination,<br/>
					apart from hearsay,<br/>
					apart from argument as to method,<br/>
					apart from reflection on reasons,<br/>
					apart from delight in speculation,<br/>
					could affirm insight,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ended is birth,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that method?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother,<br/>
					beholding an object with the eye,<br/>
					either recognizes within him the existence<br/>
					of lust, malice and illusion, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have lust, malice and illusion,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or recognizes the non-existence of these qualities within him, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have not lust, malice and illusion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now as to that recognition<br/>
					of their existence or non-existence within him,<br/>
					are these conditions,<br/>
					I ask,<br/>
					to be understood by belief,<br/>
					or inclination,<br/>
					or hearsay,<br/>
					or argument as to method,<br/>
					or reflection on reasons,<br/>
					or delight in speculation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are not these states to be understood<br/>
					by seeing them with the eye of wisdom?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Brethren,<br/>
