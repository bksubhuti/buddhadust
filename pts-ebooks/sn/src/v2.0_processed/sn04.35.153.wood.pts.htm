					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Perfect in faculty!</p>

					<p class="f4">Perfect in faculty!'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is the saying, lord.</p>
