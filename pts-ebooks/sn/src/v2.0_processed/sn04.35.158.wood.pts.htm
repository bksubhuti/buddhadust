					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do ye apply your minds thoroughly, Brethren,<br/>
					to objects,<br/>
					and regard their true nature as impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who so applies his mind thoroughly to objects,<br/>
					and so regards them,<br/>
					feels repelled by objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the destruction of the lure of objects<br/>
					comes the destruction of the lure.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the destruction of the lure of lust<br/>
					comes the destruction of lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the destruction of lust<br/>

					the heart is set free,<br/>
					and it is called<br/>
					'well-freed.'</p>
