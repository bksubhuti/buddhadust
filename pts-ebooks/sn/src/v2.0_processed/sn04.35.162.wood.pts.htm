					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha in Jivaka's Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Koṭṭhika the Great came to see the Exalted One<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One would teach me the Norm in brief,<br/>
					hearing which teaching from the Exalted One<br/>
					I might dwell solitary,<br/>
					remote,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and aspiring."</p>
