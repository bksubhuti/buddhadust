					<hr />

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Udāyin<br/>
					were staying at Kosambī in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Udāyin,<br/>
					rising at eventide from his solitude,<br/>
					went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the <span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span> exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Udāyin<br/>
					said to the venerable Ānanda: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it possible, friend Ānanda,<br/>
					just as this body has<br/>
					in divers ways been defined,<br/>
					explained,<br/>
					set forth by the Exalted One,<br/>
					as being without the self, —<br/>
					is it possible in the same way<br/>
					to describe the consciousness,<br/>
					to show it,<br/>
					make it plain,<br/>
					set it forth,<br/>
					make it clear,<br/>
					analyze and expound it<br/>
					as being also without the self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as this body has been defined,<br/>
					explained,<br/>
					set forth by the Exalted One, friend Udāyin,<br/>
					so also is it possible to describe this consciousness,<br/>
					to show it,<br/>
					make it plain,<br/>
					set it forth,<br/>
					make it clear,<br/>
					analyze and expound it<br/>
					as being also without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the eye and object<br/>
					arises eye-consciousness,<br/>
					does it not, friend?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, if the condition,<br/>
					if the cause<br/>
					of the arising of eye-consciousness<br/>
					should altogether,<br/>
					in every way,<br/>
					utterly come to cease without remainder,<br/>
					would any eye-consciousness be evident?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, it is by this method<br/>
					that the Exalted One has explained,<br/>
					opened up,<br/>
					and shown<br/>
					that this consciousness also<br/>
					is without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, owing to ear and sounds, friend,<br/>
					arises ear-consciousness,<br/>
					does it not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It does, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, if the condition,<br/>
					if the cause<br/>
					of the arising of ear-consciousness<br/>
					should cease altogether,<br/>
					in every way,<br/>
					utterly,<br/>
					without remainder,<br/>
					would any ear-consciousness be evident?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, it is by this method<br/>
					that the Exalted One has explained,<br/>
					opened up,<br/>
					and shown<br/>
					that this consciousness also<br/>
					is without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, owing to nose and scents, friend,<br/>
					arises nose-consciousness,<br/>
					does it not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It does, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, if the condition,<br/>
					if the cause<br/>
					of the arising of nose-consciousness<br/>
					should cease altogether,<br/>
					in every way,<br/>
					utterly,<br/>
					without remainder,<br/>
					would any nose-consciousness be evident?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, it is by this method<br/>
					that the Exalted One has explained,<br/>
					opened up,<br/>
					and shown<br/>
					that this consciousness also<br/>
					is without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, owing to tongue and savours, friend,<br/>
					arises tongue-consciousness,<br/>
					does it not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It does, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, if the condition, if the cause of the arising of tongue-consciousness<br/>
					should cease altogether,<br/>
					in every way,<br/>
					utterly,<br/>
					without remainder,<br/>
					would any tongue-consciousness be evident?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, it is by this method<br/>
					that the Exalted One has explained,<br/>
					opened up,<br/>
					and shown<br/>
					that this consciousness also<br/>
					is without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, owing to body and things tangible, friend,<br/>
					arises body-consciousness,<br/>
					does it not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It does, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, if the condition, if the cause of the arising of body-consciousness<br/>
					should cease altogether,<br/>
					in every way,<br/>
					utterly,<br/>
					without remainder,<br/>
					would any body-consciousness be evident?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, it is by this method<br/>
					that the Exalted One has explained,<br/>
					opened up,<br/>
					and shown<br/>
					that this consciousness also<br/>
					is without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, owing to mind and mind-states<br/>
					arises mind-consciousness,<br/>
					does it not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, if the condition, if the cause for the arising of mind- <span class="f2 g"><b>[104]</b></span> consciousness<br/>
					should cease altogether,<br/>
					in every way,<br/>
					utterly,<br/>
					without remainder,<br/>
					would any mind-consciousness be evident?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, it is by this method<br/>
					that the Exalted One has explained,<br/>
					opened up,<br/>
					and shown<br/>
					that this consciousness also<br/>
					is without the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, friend, that a man should roam about in need of heart of wood,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					searching for heart of wood,<br/>
					looking for heart of wood, and,<br/>
					taking a sharp axe,<br/>
					should enter a forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he sees a mighty plantain-trunk,<br/>
					straight up,<br/>
					new-grown,<br/>
					of towering height.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cuts it down at the root.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cut it down at the root he chops it off at the top.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so he peels off the outer skin.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he would find no pith inside.</p>

					<p class="f4">Much less would he find heart of wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, friend, a brother beholds no trace of the self<br/>
					nor of what pertains to the self<br/>
					in the sixfold sense-sphere.</p>

					<p class="f4">So beholding, he is attached to nothing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unattached, he is not troubled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Untroubled, he is of himself utterly set free.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> So that he realizes,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lived is the righteous life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Done is the task.</p>

					<p class="f4">For life in these conditions there is no hereafter.'</p>
