					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Proficient in three ways, Brethren,<br/>
					a brother dwells to the full<br/>
					with ease and pleasure in this very life,<br/>
					and he has strong grounds<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what three things?</p>

					<p class="f4">He keeps guard on the door of the faculties,<br/>
					he is moderate in eating,<br/>
					he is given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, does a brother<br/>
					keep guard on the door of the faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a brother,<br/>
					seeing an object with the eye,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					is not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of eye uncontrolled,<br/>
					he applies himself to such control,<br/>
					sets a guard over the faculty of eye,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears a sound with the ear,<br/>
					he is not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of ear uncontrolled,<br/>
					he applies himself to such control,<br/>
					sets a guard over the faculty of ear,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with the nose he smells a scent,<br/>
					he is not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of nose uncontrolled,<br/>
					he applies himself to such control,<br/>
					sets a guard over the faculty of nose,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with the tongue he tastes a savour,<br/>
					he is not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of tongue uncontrolled,<br/>
					he applies himself to such control,<br/>
					sets a guard over the faculty of tongue,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with body he contacts tangibles,<br/>
					he is not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of body uncontrolled,<br/>
					he applies himself to such control,<br/>

					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with mind he cognizes a mind-state,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span> he is not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of ear uncontrolled,<br/>
					he applies himself to such control,<br/>
					sets a guard over the faculty of ear,<br/>
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, on level ground<br/>
					at the crossing of the four highways<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					a car be drawn by thoroughbreds,<br/>
					with a goad set in rest therein,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					and a clever trainer,<br/>
					a driver who tames steeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He mounts thereon,<br/>
					with his left hand holding the reins,<br/>
					and in his right he takes the goad,<br/>
					and drives the car forward and backward,<br/>
					whither and how he wills.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, Brethren, a brother practises the guard over the six faculties,<br/>
					he practises for their restraint,<br/>
					for their taming,<br/>
					for their calming.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Brethren, is how a brother keeps a guard over the faculties.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother moderate in eating?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother takes his food<br/>
					thoughtfully and prudently,<br/>
					not for sport,<br/>
					not for indulgence,<br/>
					not for personal charm and adornment,<br/>
					but sufficient for the support<br/>
					and upkeep of body,<br/>
					to allay its pains,<br/>
					to help the practice of the righteous life,<br/>
					with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My former feeling I check<br/>
					and set on foot<br/>
					no new feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">So shall I keep going,<br/>
					be blameless<br/>
					and live at ease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man, Brethren, anoints a wound<br/>
					just for the healing of it,<br/>
					or just as he oils an axle<br/>
					enough for carrying the load,<br/>
					even so<br/>
					thoughtfully and prudently<br/>
					does a brother take his food,<br/>
					not for sport,<br/>
					not for indulgence,<br/>
					not for personal charm and adornment,<br/>
					but sufficient for the support<br/>
					and upkeep of body,<br/>
					to allay its pains,<br/>
					to help the practice of the righteous life,<br/>
					with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My former feeling I check<br/>
					and set on foot<br/>
					no new feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">So shall I keep going,<br/>
					be blameless<br/>
					and live at ease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Brethren, is how a brother is moderate in eating.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother given to watchfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, by day<br/>
					a brother walks up and down and sits,<br/>
					and so cleanses his heart<br/>
					from states that may hinder.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">By night, for the first watch,<br/>
					a brother walks up and down and sits,<br/>
					and so cleanses his heart<br/>
					from states that may hinder.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night,<br/>
					lying on his right side,<br/>
					he takes up the posture of a lion,<br/>
					resting one foot on the other,<br/>
					and thus collected and composed<br/>
					fixes his thought on rising up again.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the last watch of the night,<br/>
					at early dawn,<br/>
					he walks up and <span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span> down and sits,<br/>
					and so cleanses his heart<br/>
					from states that may hinder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Brethren, is a brother given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Brethren, possessed of these three things,<br/>
					a brother dwells to the full<br/>
					with ease and pleasure in this very life,<br/>
					and so has strong grounds<br/>
					for the destruction of the āsavas."</p>
