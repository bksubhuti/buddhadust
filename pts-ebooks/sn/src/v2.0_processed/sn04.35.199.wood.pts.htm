					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Formerly, Brethren, a tortoise,<br/>
					a shell-back,<br/>
					was questing for its prey<br/>
					at eventide<br/>
					along a river bank.</p>

					<p class="f4">A jackal also, Brethren,<br/>
					was questing for its prey<br/>
					at eventide<br/>
					along that river bank.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, that tortoise,<br/>
					that shell-back<br/>
					saw from afar<br/>
					that jackal<br/>
					questing for its prey.</p>

					<p class="f4">So drawing its neck and four limbs<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					into its shell<br/>
					it crouched down at leisure<br/>
					and kept still.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the jackal,<br/>
					seeing that tortoise,<br/>
					the shell-back,<br/>
					from afar,<br/>
					came up to it,<br/>
					and on reaching it<br/>
					kept watching it<br/>
					with the thought:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'As soon as the tortoise,<br/>
					the shell-back,<br/>
					puts out one or other of its five limbs,<br/>
					I'll seize it,<br/>
					crack and eat it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Brethren, as the tortoise,<br/>
					the shell-back,<br/>
					did not put out one or other of its five limbs,<br/>
					the jackal was disgusted with the tortoise<br/>
					and went away,<br/>
					not having got a chance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, <i>Māra</i>,<br/>
					the Evil One,<br/>
					is for ever on the watch<br/>
					unceasingly,<br/>
					with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Maybe I shall get a chance<br/>
					to catch one of these,<br/>
					by way of eye<br/>
					by way of the ear,<br/>
					by way of the nose,<br/>
					by way of the tongue,<br/>
					by way of the body,<br/>
					by way of the mind.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Brethren, do ye abide keeping watch over the doors of the faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing an object with the eye,<br/>
					be not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of eye uncontrolled,<br/>
					do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br/>
					set a guard over the faculty of eye,<br/>
					attain control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the ear,<br/>
					be not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one<br/>

					set a guard over the faculty of ear,<br/>
					attain control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with the nose smelling a scent,<br/>
					be is not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>

					do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br/>
					set a guard over the faculty of nose,<br/>
					attain control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with the tongue tasting a savour,<br/>
					be is not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one<br/>

					do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br/>
					set a guard over the faculty of tongue,<br/>
					attain control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with body contacting tangibles,<br/>
					be is not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>
					might overwhelm one<br/>
					who dwells with the faculty of body uncontrolled,<br/>
					do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br/>
					set a guard over the faculty of body,<br/>
					attain control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with mind he cognizing a mind-state,<br/>
					be is not misled by its outer view<br/>
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br/>
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br/>

					set a guard over the faculty of ear,<br/>
					attain control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">So long, Brethren, as ye abide<br/>
					keeping watch over the doors of the faculties,<br/>
					<i>Māra,</i> the Evil One, will go away in disgust,<br/>
					not getting a chance,<br/>
					as the jackal did not get a chance<br/>
					from the tortoise."</p>
