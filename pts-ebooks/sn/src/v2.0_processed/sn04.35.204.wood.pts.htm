					that brother said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I went to a certain brother<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, friend, how far is a brother's insight fully purified?'</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, lord,<br/>

					<p class="f4">At these words, lord,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But I was dissatisfied<br/>

					went away to another brother<br/>
					and asked this question of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, friend, how far is a brother's insight fully purified?'</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, lord,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again I was dissatisfied<br/>

					and went away to another brother<br/>

					<p class="f4">At these words, lord,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So, lord, being dissatisfied<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, brother, a man who had never seen a Judas tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he went to a certain man<br/>
					who had seen one,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					and on coming to him asked him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, my man, the Judas <span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span> tree is blackish,<br/>
					something like a charred stump.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being,<br/>
					the Judas tree is to him as that other man sees it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, the man is not satisfied<br/>
					with the answer to his question,<br/>
					so he goes away to another man who had seen one<br/>
					and on coming to him asked him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, my man, the Judas tree is reddish,<br/>
					something like a lump of flesh.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being<br/>
					the Judas tree is to him as that other man sees it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Still dissatisfied<br/>
					with the reply to his question,<br/>
					he goes away to another man who had seen one<br/>
					and on coming to him asked him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why, my man, a Judas tree is stripped of its bark.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It has its pods burst,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					something like an acacia tree.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, the man is not satisfied<br/>
					with the reply to his question,<br/>
					so he goes away to see yet another man who had seen a Judas tree,<br/>
					and on coming to him asked him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, my man, the Judas tree is very thick-leaved.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It gives a close shade,<br/>
					just like a banyan tree.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being a Judas tree is to him as that other sees it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, brother, according as the insight<br/>
					of those good folk<br/>
					is fully purified,<br/>
					in accordance with that<br/>
					they give their explanation of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, brother,<br/>
					the insight of these worthies<br/>
					is fully purified<br/>
					according to their several bents,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span><br/>
					and they give their explanation accordingly.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is even as some rajah's border-town,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span> brother,<br/>
					strongly built<br/>

					<p class="f4">This town hath a wise and watchful<br/>

					<p class="f4">From the east there comes a pair of swift messengers,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And he replies:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brother, have I made you a parable,<br/>
					and for your understanding of it<br/>
					this is the explanation: -</p>
