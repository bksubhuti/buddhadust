					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The untaught manyfolk, Brethren,<br/>
					feels feeling that is pleasant,<br/>
					feeling that is painful<br/>
					and feeling that is neutral.</p>

					<p class="f4">The well-taught Ariyan disciple, Brethren,<br/>
					feels feeling that is pleasant,<br/>
					feeling that is painful<br/>
					and feeling that is neutral.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now herein, Brethren,<br/>
					what is the distinction,<br/>
					what is the specific feature,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					what is the difference<br/>
					between the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					and the untaught manyfolk?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br/>
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br/>
					their guide,<br/>
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br/>
					if the meaning of this that has been spoken<br/>
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/>
					the brethren will remember it."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"The untaught manyfolk, Brethren,<br/>
					being touched by feeling that is painful,<br/>
					weeps and wails,<br/>
					cries aloud,<br/>
					knocks the breast,<br/>
					falls into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">For he feels a twofold feeling,<br/>
					bodily<br/>
					and mental.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, they pierce a man with a barb,<br/>
					then with a second barb,<br/>
					just so, Brethren,<br/>
					that man feels the pain of two barbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does the untaught manyfolk<br/>
					being touched by feeling that is painful,<br/>
					weep and wail,<br/>
					crie aloud,<br/>
					knock the breast,<br/>
					fall into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">For he feels a twofold feeling,<br/>
					bodily<br/>
					and mental.</p>

					<p class="f4"> <span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span> Touched by that painful feeling<br/>
					he feels repugnance for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling that repugnance for the painful feeling,<br/>
					the lurking tendency to repugnance<br/>
					fastens on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by the painful feeling,<br/>
					he delights in pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">The untaught manyfolk, Brethren,<br/>
					knows of no refuge from painful feeling<br/>
					save sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighting in that sensual pleasure,<br/>
					the lurking tendency to sensual pleasure<br/>
					fastens on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the arising<br/>
					and the destruction of feelings,<br/>
					nor the satisfaction,<br/>
					the misery,<br/>
					the way of escape from feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he understands them not,<br/>
					the lurking tendency to ignorance of neutral feeling<br/>
					fastens on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels feeling that is pleasant,<br/>
					he feels it as one in bondage.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels feeling that is painful,<br/>
					he feels it as one in bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels feeling that is neutral,<br/>
					he feels it as one in bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">This untaught many-folk, Brethren, is called<br/>
					'in bondage to birth,<br/>
					death,<br/>
					sorrow<br/>
					and grief,<br/>
					woe,<br/>
					lamentation<br/>
					and despair.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is in bondage to ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					when touched by painful feeling,<br/>
					weeps not,<br/>
					wails not,<br/>
					cries not aloud,<br/>
					knocks not the breast,<br/>
					falls not into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He feels but one feeling,<br/>
					the bodily,<br/>
					not the mental.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, they pierce a man with a barb,<br/>
					but do not pierce him with a second barb.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that man feels<br/>
					but the pain caused by the one barb.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, the well-taught Arivan disciple,<br/>
					when touched by painful feeling,<br/>
					weeps not,<br/>
					wails not,<br/>
					cries not aloud,<br/>
					knocks not the breast,<br/>
					falls not into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He feels but one feeling,<br/>
					bodily pain,<br/>
					not mental.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, he has no repugnance for painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he has no repugnance for it,<br/>
					the lurking tendency to repugnance for painful feeling<br/>
					fastens not on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when touched by painful feeling,<br/>
					delights not in sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					knows of a refuge from painful feeling<br/>
					apart from sensual ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he delights not in sensual ease,<br/>
					the <span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span> lurking tendency to sensual ease<br/>
					fastens not on bim.</p>

					<p class="f4">As be understands, as they really are,<br/>
					both the arising<br/>
					and the destruction<br/>
					of these feelings,<br/>
					the satisfaction,<br/>
					the misery of them,<br/>
					the way of escape therefrom,<br/>
					the lurking tendency to ignorance of neutral feeling<br/>
					fastens not on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a feeling that is pleasant,<br/>
					he feels it as one freed from bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a feeling that is painful,<br/>
					he feels it as one that is freed from bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a neutral feeling,<br/>
					he feels it as one that is freed from bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">This well-taught Axiyan disciple, Brethren,<br/>
					is called<br/>
					'freed from the bondage of birth,<br/>
					old age,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					from sorrow and grief,<br/>
					from woe,<br/>
					lamentation<br/>
					and despair.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is freed from the bondage of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Brethren, is the distinction,<br/>
					the specific feature,<br/>
					the difference<br/>
					between the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br/>
					and the untaught manyfolk."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Not swayed by feelings is the sage. Nor ease<br/>
							Nor pain affecteth him of knowledge wide.<br/>
							Betwixt the wise man and the worldly one<br/>
							Vast is the difference in goodliness.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">A searcher of the Norm,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> of knowledge wide,<br/>
							Who rightly views this world and that beyond,<br/>
							Is not heart-harassed by things desired:<br/>
							By undesired things he is not repelled.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">By his disinclination and dislike<br/>
							They're blown away, departed, are no more.<br/>
							Knowing the stainless path and sorrowless,<br/>
							He rightly knows, becoming he's o'erpassed."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>
