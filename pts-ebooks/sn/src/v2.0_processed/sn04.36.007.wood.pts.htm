					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Vesālī,<br/>
					in Great Grove,<br/>
					at the Hall of the Peaked Gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One<br/>
					at eventide<br/>
					rising from his solitude<br/>
					went to visit the sick-ward,<br/>
					and on reaching it<br/>
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Exalted One addressed the Brethren, saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, a brother should meet his end<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					collected and composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is our instruction to you.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is one collected?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother dwells,<br/>
					as regards body,<br/>
					contemplating body as transient,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and thoughtful,<br/>
					by having put away<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

					<p class="f4">He<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> dwells,<br/>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother composed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, in his going forth<br/>
					and in his returning<br/>
					a brother acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In looking in front<br/>
					and looking behind,<br/>
					he acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In bending or relaxing (his limbs)<br/>
					he acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In wearing his robe<br/>
					and bearing outer robe and bowl,<br/>
					in eating,<br/>
					drinking,<br/>
					chewing,<br/>
					and tasting<br/>

					<p class="f4">In easing himself,<br/>
					in going,<br/>

					sitting,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, as that brother dwells collected,<br/>
