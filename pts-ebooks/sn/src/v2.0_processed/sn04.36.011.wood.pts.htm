					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother went to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					that brother said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, lord, as I was meditating alone<br/>
					this reflection arose in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Three feelings have been spoken of by the Exalted One:<br/>
					pleasant feeling,<br/>
					painful feeling<br/>
					and neutral feeling:<br/>
					these three.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One has said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever is experienced,<br/>
					that is joined with ill."'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, concerning what was this saying uttered:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/>
					that is joined with ill'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">These three feelings were named by me,<br/>
					and I said also,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/>
					that is joined with ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brother, this saying of mine<br/>
					was uttered concerning<br/>
					the impermanence of compounded things.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">This saying of mine,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/>
					that is joined with ill,'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span> was uttered concerning<br/>
					the perishable nature of compounded things.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">This saying of mine,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/>
					that is joined with ill,'</p>

					<p class="f4">was uttered concerning<br/>
					transient nature<br/>
					of compounded things.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">This saying of mine,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/>
					that is joined with ill,'</p>

					<p class="f4">was uttered concerning<br/>
					their nature to fade away<br/>
					of compounded things.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br/>
					that is joined with ill,'</p>

					<p class="f4">was uttered concerning<br/>
					their nature to cease<br/>
					of compounded things.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brother, I have seen,<br/>
					that the ceasing of the activities is gradual.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/>
					speech has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/>
					thought initial and sustained has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/>
					zest has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/>
					inbreathing and outbreathing have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite space,<br/>
					perception of objects has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					perception of the realm of infinite space has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of nothingness,<br/>
					the perception of the realm of infinite consciousness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br/>
					the perception of the realm of nothingness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both perception and feeling have ceased<br/>
					when one has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/>
					lust is extinguished,<br/>
					hatred is extinguished,<br/>
					illusion is extinguished.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, brother, I have seen<br/>
					that the mastery of the activities is gradual.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/>

					illusion is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six calmings, brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/>
					speech is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/>
					thought initial and sustained<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/>
					zest is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/>
					inbreathing and outbreathing is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the trance where perception and feeling have ceased,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					perception and feeling are calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/>
					lust is calmed down,<br/>
					hatred is calmed down,<br/>
					illusion is calmed down."</p>
