					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to see the Exalted One<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, what are the feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the arising of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the ceasing of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What the way leading to the ceasing of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the satisfaction?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the misery?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the refuge from feeling?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these three feelings, Ānanda:<br/>
					pleasant feeling,<br/>
					painful feeling,<br/>
					neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Ānanda, are called feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the arising of contact<br/>
					comes the arising of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the ceasing of contact<br/>
					comes the ceasing of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Ariyan Eightfold Path<br/>
					is the way leading to the ceasing of feelings,<br/>
					namely:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right belief,<br/>
					right intention,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right contemplation.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That pleasure,<br/>
					that mental ease<br/>
					which arises owing to feeling, -<br/>
					that is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">'the satisfaction of feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As to the feelings which are impermanent,<br/>
					painful,<br/>
					changeable by nature, -<br/>
					these are called:</p>

					<p class="f4">'the misery of feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust for feeling,<br/>
					that abandoning of desire and lust for feeling, -<br/>
					that is the refuge from feeling.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Ānanda, I have seen,<br/>
					the ceasing of the activities to be gradual.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/>
					speech has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/>
					thought initial and sustained has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/>
					zest has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/>
					inbreathing and outbreathing have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite space,<br/>
					perception of objects has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					perception of the realm of infinite space has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of nothingness,<br/>
					the perception of the realm of infinite consciousness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br/>
					the perception of the realm of nothingness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both perception and feeling have ceased<br/>
					when one has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/>
					lust is extinguished,<br/>
					hatred is extinguished,<br/>
					illusion is extinguished.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, I have seen<br/>
					that the mastery of the activities is gradual.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/>
					speech is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/>
					thought initial and sustained is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/>
					zest is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/>
					inbreathing and outbreathing is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite space,<br/>
					perception of objects is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					perception of the realm of infinite space is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of nothingness,<br/>
					the perception of the realm of infinite consciousness is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br/>
					the perception of the realm of nothingness is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both perception and feeling are mastered<br/>
					when one has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/>
					lust is mastered,<br/>
					hatred is mastered,<br/>
					illusion is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six calmings, Ānanda.</p>
					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br/>
					speech is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br/>
					thought initial and sustained is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br/>
					zest is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br/>
					inbreathing and outbreathing is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the trance where perception and feeling have ceased,<br/>
					perception and feeling are calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br/>
					lust is calmed down,<br/>
					hatred is calmed down,<br/>
					illusion is calmed down."</p>
