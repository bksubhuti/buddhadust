					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are two feelings, brethren,<br/>
					in mv way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also three feelings, brethren,<br/>
					in my way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also five feelings, brethren,<br/>
					in my way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also six feelings, brethren,<br/>
					in my way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also eighteen feelings, brethren,<br/>
					in my way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also thirty-six feelings, brethren,<br/>
					in my way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also one hundred and eight feelings in mv way of explaining, brethren.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the exposition of the Norm taught by me, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though I have thus expounded my method of teaching the Norm, brethren,<br/>
					of those who will not approve of,<br/>
					will not agree with,<br/>
					each other's exposition of it,<br/>
					however well said and spoken, -<br/>
					of such you may expect this:</p>

					<p class="f4">They will dwell quarrelsome,<br/>
					wrangling,<br/>
					disputatious,<br/>
					wounding each other with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now such is the method of the Norm,<br/>
					as expounded by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I have so expounded it,<br/>
					those who approve of,<br/>
					agree with,<br/>
					each other's exposition of it,<br/>
					being well said andspoken, -<br/>
					of such you may expect this:</p>

					<p class="f4">They will dwell in harmony,<br/>
					courteous,<br/>
					without quarrelling,<br/>
					like milk and water mixed,<br/>
					looking on one another<br/>
					with the eye of affection.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these five sensual elements, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Objects cognizable by the eve,<br/>
					desirable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and dear,<br/>
					passion-fraught,<br/>
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognizable by the ear,<br/>
					desirable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and dear,<br/>
					passion-fraught,<br/>
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Scents cognizable by the nose,<br/>
					desirable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and dear,<br/>
					passion-fraught,<br/>
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Savours cognizable by the tongue,<br/>
					desirable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and dear,<br/>
					passion-fraught,<br/>
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tangibles cognizable by the body,<br/>
					desirable,<br/>
					pleasant,<br/>
					delightful<br/>
					and dear,<br/>
					passion-fraught,<br/>
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are the five sensual elements.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That pleasure,<br/>
					that happiness<br/>
					that arises owing to the five sensual elements, -<br/>
					that, brethren,<br/>
					is called "sensual pleasure."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brethren, there may be some who aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/>
					that beings experience.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/>
					I do not allow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/>
					still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/>
					aloof from sensua1ity,<br/>
					aloof from evil conditions,<br/>
					enters on the first trance,<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					which is born of solitude,<br/>
					easeful and zestful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is another pleasure<br/>
					still more excellent<br/>
					still more exquisite<br/>
					than that one.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/>
					that beings can experience.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/>
					I do not allow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/>
					still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/>
					by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					enters on the inward calm,<br/>
					that single-mindedness of will,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and full of ease,<br/>
					which is the second trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/>
					still more excellent,<br/>
					still more exquisite<br/>
					than that other.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/>
					that beings can experience.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br/>
					I do not allow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/>
					still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/>
					by the fading out of zest<br/>
					becomes balanced<br/>
					and remains mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences with the body<br/>
					the happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced thoughtful man<br/>
					dwells happily.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he enters on the third trance<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/>
					still more excellent,<br/>
					still more exquisite<br/>
					than that other.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br/>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br/>
					still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/>
					rejecting pleasure and pain,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow<br/>
					which he had before,<br/>
					enters on<br/>
					and abides in<br/>
					the fourth trance,<br/>
					which is free of pain<br/>
					and free of pleasure,<br/>
					but is a state of perfect purity<br/>
					of balance<br/>
					and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/>
					still more excellent,<br/>
					still more exquisite<br/>
					than that other.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br/>
					passing utterly beyond the perception of objects,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of perception of resistance,<br/>
					by not attending to perception of diversity,<br/>
					with the idea of<br/>
					'infinite is space,'<br/>
					attains<br/>
					and abides in<br/>
					the realm of the infinity of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, the Exalted One did not proclaim that<br/>
