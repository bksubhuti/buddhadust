					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					the Wanderer Sīvaka of the Top-knot<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					paid a visit to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br/>

					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer Slvaka of the Top-knot<br/>
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are some recluses and brahmins, master Gotama,<br/>

					who hold this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever pleasure or pain or mental state<br/>
