					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to see the Exalted One<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side that brother said this: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, lord, are the feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What the arising of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the way leading to the arising of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the ceasing of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the way leading to their ceasing?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the satisfaction,<br/>
					the misery of feelings,<br/>
					what is the way of escape from feelings?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these three feelings, brother:<br/>
					pleasant feelings,<br/>
					painful feelings<br/>
					and neutral feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brother, are called<br/>
					'the three feelings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">From the arising of contact<br/>
					comes the arising of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is the way<br/>
					leading to the arising of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the ceasing of contact<br/>
					comes the ceasing of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Ariyan Eightfold Path, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right belief,<br/>
					right intention,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right contemplation,<br/>
					is the way leading to the ceasing of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">The pleasure and happiness<br/>
					which arise owing to feeling, -<br/>
					that is the satisfaction in feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">The misery of feeling<br/>
					is the impermanence,<br/>
					the pain,<br/>
					the unsubstantial nature of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">The abolishing of desire and lust,<br/>
					the abandoning of desire and lust, -<br/>
					that is the escape from feelings."</p>
