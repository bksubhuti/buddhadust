					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these three feelings, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasant feeling,<br/>
					painful feeling,<br/>
					neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/>
					understand not as they really are<br/>
					the arising,<br/>
