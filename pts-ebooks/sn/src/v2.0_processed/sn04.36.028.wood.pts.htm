					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these three feelings, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasant feeling,<br/>
					painful feeling,<br/>
					neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/>
					understand not the arising of feeling,<br/>
					the ceasing of feeling,<br/>
					the way leading to the ceasing of feeling,<br/>
					those recluses or those brahmins are approved<br/>
					neither among recluses as recluses,<br/>
					nor among brahmins as brahmins,<br/>
					nor have those venerable ones<br/>
					even in this present life<br/>
					understood of themselves,<br/>
					nor realized<br/>
					what is the good<br/>
					of being either recluse or brahmin,<br/>
					nor lived in the attainment thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">But those recluses and brahmins<br/>
					who have understood the arising of feeling,<br/>
					the ceasing of feeling,<br/>
					the way leading to the ceasing of feeling,<br/>
					those recluses or those brahmins are approved<br/>
					both among recluses as recluses,<br/>
					and among brahmins as brahmins,<br/>
					and those venerable ones<br/>
					even in this present life<br/>
					have understood of themselves,<br/>
					and realized<br/>
					what is the good<br/>
					of being either recluse or brahmin,<br/>
					and lived in the attainment thereof.]</p>
