					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these five powers in a woman, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of beauty,<br/>
					the power of wealth,<br/>
					the power of kin,<br/>
					the power of sons,<br/>
					the power of virtue.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, a woman is possessed<br/>
					of the power of beauty,<br/>
					but not of the power of wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is she defective by one quality.</p>

					<p class="f4">But suppose her possessed<br/>
					of the power of beauty,<br/>
					and of the power of wealth<br/>
					then is she complete by that quality.</p>
