					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Vāsenti.</i> <i>Pali Dict.</i> takes the word as simply 'preserve'; but <i>Comy.</i> says: 'Saying "she hath trespassed beyond bounds," they take her by the neck and throw her out. They do not "let her stay" in the family.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> PTS text and Woodward omit this variation which is included in the BJT. Further, I believe the subsequent versions should follow in diminishing number of powers rather than singly so that the sutta ends with the woman possessing only virtue and no other powers but is still retained by the family, but no text supports this.</p>
