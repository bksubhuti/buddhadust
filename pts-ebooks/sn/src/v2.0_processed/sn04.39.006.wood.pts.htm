					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying among the Vajjī,<br/>
					at Ukkāvelā<br/>
					on the banks of the river Ganges.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sāmaṇḍaka, the Wanderer, came to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him in friendly wise,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer Sāmaṇḍaka said this to the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Supreme comfort, supreme comfort!' is the saying, friend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray how far has a man won supreme comfort?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In so far, friend, as one understands,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					the arising and the ceasing,<br/>
					the satisfaction<br/>
					and the misery of,<br/>
					and the escape from,<br/>
					the sixfold sense-sphere,<br/>
					just so far, friend,<br/>
					has he won supreme comfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, is there any way,<br/>
					any approach<br/>
					to the realization of this supreme comfort?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is such a path, friend,<br/>
					there is such an approach<br/>
					to the realization of this supreme comfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is that path, friend,<br/>
					what is that approach<br/>
					to the realization of this supreme comfort?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, friend,<br/>
					to the realization of this supreme comfort<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, friend, is this path,<br/>
					this approach<br/>
					to the realization of this supreme comfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">"A goodly path, friend,<br/>
					a goodly approach<br/>
					to the realization of this comfort<br/>
					and a proper occasion for earnestness too, friend!"</p>
