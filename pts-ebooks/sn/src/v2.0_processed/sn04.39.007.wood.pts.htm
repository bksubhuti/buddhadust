					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying among the Vajjī,<br/>
					at Ukkāvelā<br/>
					on the banks of the river Ganges.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sāmaṇḍaka, the Wanderer, came to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him in friendly wise,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer Sāmaṇḍaka said this to the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Feeling, feeling!' is the saying, friend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray what is feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these three feelings, friend:<br/>
					pleasant feeling,<br/>
					painful feeling,<br/>
					neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three feelings."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, is there any way,<br/>
					any approach<br/>
					to the comprehension of these feelings?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is such a path, friend,<br/>
					there is such an approach<br/>
					to the comprehension of these feelings."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is that path, friend,<br/>
					what is that approach<br/>
					to the comprehension of these feelings?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, friend,<br/>
					to the comprehension of these feelings<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, friend, is this path,<br/>
					this approach<br/>
					to the comprehension of these feelings."</p>

					<p class="f4">"A goodly path, friend,<br/>
					a goodly approach<br/>
					to the comprehension of these feelings<br/>
					and a proper occasion for earnestness too, friend!"</p>
