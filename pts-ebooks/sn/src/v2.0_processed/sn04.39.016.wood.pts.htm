					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying among the Vajjī,<br/>
					at Ukkāvelā<br/>
					on the banks of the river Ganges.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sāmaṇḍaka, the Wanderer, came to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him in friendly wise,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer Sāmaṇḍaka said this to the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, friend Sāriputta, what is hard to do<br/>
					in this Norm-discipline?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Going forth, friend, is hard to do<br/>
					in this Norm-discipline."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, for one who has gone forth,<br/>
					what is hard to do?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For one who has gone forth, friend,<br/>
					to feel delight<br/>
					is a thing hard to do."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					what can be hard to do<br/>
					for one who feels delight?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The practice<br/>
					of what is in conformity with the Norm, friend,<br/>
					is hard to do<br/>
					for him who feels delight."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, friend?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would one who has long practised<br/>
					in conformity with the Norm<br/>
					become an Arahant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"After no long time, friend."</p>
