					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds] </span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">O<span class="f2">NCE</span> the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/>
					addressed the brethren, saving:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, brother," replied those brethren<br/>
					to the venerable Moggallāna the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, when I was meditating alone here,<br/>
					this consideration arose in me:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'They say "the second trance,<br/>
					the second trance!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what is the second trance?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, friends, this occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein when a brother,<br/>
					by the calming down<br/>
					of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					attains the inward calm,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of will,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					zestful and full of ease,<br/>
					which is the second trance,<br/>
					and abides therein,<br/>
					this is called the second trance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, friends, by the calming down<br/>
					of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					attaining the inward calm,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of will,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					zestful and full of ease,<br/>
					entered on the second trance<br/>
					and abode therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I had so done<br/>
					(and had emerged from trance),<br/>
					perception and work of mind<br/>
					connected with directed thought<br/>
					still continued.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, friends, the Exalted One<br/>
					by magic power<br/>
					came to me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Moggallāna,<br/>
					Moggallāna,<br/>
					be not remiss in the second trance, brahmin!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make steadfast thy mind in the second trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the second trance make the mind one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the second trance compose the mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">So after that, friends, by the calming down<br/>
					of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					attaining the inward calm,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of will,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of concentration,<br/>
					zestful and full of ease,<br/>
					I entered upon<br/>
					and abode in the second trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, friends, if anyone would say rightly:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Helped by the Master<br/>
					the disciple won great super-knowledge,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he would say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Helped by the Master<br/>
					did the disciple win great super-knowledge.'"</p>
