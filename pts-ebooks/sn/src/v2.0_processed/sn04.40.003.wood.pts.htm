					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds] </span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">O<span class="f2">NCE</span> the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/>
					addressed the brethren, saving:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, brother," replied those brethren<br/>
					to the venerable Moggallāna the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, when I was meditating alone here,<br/>
					this consideration arose in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'They say "the third trance,<br/>
					the third trance!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what is the third trance?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, friends, this occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein a brother,<br/>
					by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					abides balanced<br/>
					and remains mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences with the body<br/>
					that ease of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The balanced,<br/>
					thoughtful man<br/>
					dwells happily."|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he enters on<br/>
					and abides in the third trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called "the third trance."'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, friends, by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					abiding balanced<br/>
					and remaining mindful and composed,<br/>
					experienceing with the body<br/>
					that ease of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced,<br/>
					thoughtful man<br/>
					dwells happily.'|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">entered the third trance<br/>
					and abode therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I had thus abode<br/>
					(and had emerged from trance),<br/>
					perception and work of mind<br/>
					connected with zest<br/>
					still continued.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, friends, the Exalted One<br/>
					by magic power<br/>
					came to me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Moggallāna,<br/>
					Moggallāna,<br/>
					be not remiss in the third trance, brahmin!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make steadfast thy mind in the third trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the third trance make the mind one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the third trance compose the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So after that, friends, by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					abiding balanced<br/>
					and remaining mindful and composed,<br/>
					experienceing with the body<br/>
					that ease of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced,<br/>
					thoughtful man<br/>
					dwells happily.'|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">entered the third trance<br/>
					and abode therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, friends, if anyone would say rightly:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Helped by the Master<br/>
					the disciple won great super-knowledge,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he would say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Helped by the Master<br/>
					did the disciple win great super-knowledge.'"</p>
