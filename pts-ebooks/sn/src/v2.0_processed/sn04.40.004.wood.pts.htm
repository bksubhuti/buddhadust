					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds] </span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">O<span class="f2">NCE</span> the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/>
					addressed the brethren, saving:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, brother," replied those brethren<br/>
					to the venerable Moggallāna the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, when I was meditating alone here,<br/>
					this consideration arose in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'They say "the fourth trance,<br/>
					the fourth trance!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what is the fourth trance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, friends, this occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein a brother,<br/>
					rejecting pleasure,<br/>
					rejecting pain,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br/>
					enters on and abides in<br/>
					the fourth trance,<br/>
					which is freed from pleasure,<br/>
					freed from pain,<br/>
					but is a state<br/>
					of perfect purity of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called "the fourth trance."'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, friends,<br/>
					rejecting pleasure,<br/>
					rejecting pain,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br/>
					entered on and abode in<br/>
					the fourth trance,<br/>
					which is freed from pleasure,<br/>
					freed from pain,<br/>
					but is a state<br/>
					of perfect purity of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I had thus abode<br/>
					(and had emerged from trance),<br/>
					perception and work of mind<br/>
					connected with happiness still continued.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span> Thereupon, friends, the Exalted One<br/>
					by magic power<br/>
					came to me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Moggallāna,<br/>
					Moggallāna,<br/>
					be not remiss in the fourth trance, brahmin!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make steadfast thy mind in the fourth trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the fourth trance make the mind one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the fourth trance compose the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So after that,<br/>
					rejecting pleasure,<br/>
					rejecting pain,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br/>
					entered on and abode in<br/>
					the fourth trance,<br/>
					which is freed from pleasure,<br/>
					freed from pain,<br/>
					but is a state<br/>
					of perfect purity of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, friends, if anyone would say rightly:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Helped by the Master<br/>
					the disciple won great super-knowledge,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he would say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Helped by the Master<br/>
					did the disciple win great super-knowledge.'"</p>
