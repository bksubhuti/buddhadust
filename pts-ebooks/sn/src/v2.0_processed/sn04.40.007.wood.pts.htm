					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[1][olds] </span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">O<span class="f2">NCE</span> the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/>
					addressed the brethren, saving:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, brother," replied those brethren<br/>
					to the venerable Moggallāna the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, when I was meditating alone here,<br/>
					this consideration arose in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'They say "the realm of nothingness,<br/>
					the realm of nothingness!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what is the realm of nothingness?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, friends, this occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein a brother,<br/>
					passing utterly beyond the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					with the idea:<br/>
					"There is nothing at all,"<br/>
					enters on and abides in<br/>
					the realm of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called "the realm of nothingness."'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[184]</b></span> So I, friends,<br/>
					passing utterly beyond the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					with the idea:<br/>
					'There is nothing at all,'<br/>
					entered on and abode in<br/>
					the realm of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I had thus abode<br/>
					(and had emerged from trance),<br/>
					perception and work of mind<br/>
					connected with the perception of the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					still continued.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, friends, the Exalted One<br/>
					by magic power<br/>
					came to me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Moggallāna,<br/>
					Moggallāna,<br/>
					be not remiss in the realm of nothingness, brahmin!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make steadfast thy mind in the realm of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the realm of nothingness make the mind one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the realm of nothingness compose the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So after that, friends,<br/>
					passing utterly beyond the realm of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					with the idea:<br/>
					'There is nothing at all,'<br/>
					entered on and abode in<br/>
					the realm of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, friends, if anyone would say rightly:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Helped by the Master<br/>
					the disciple won great super-knowledge,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he would say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Helped by the Master<br/>
					did the disciple win great super-knowledge.'"</p>
