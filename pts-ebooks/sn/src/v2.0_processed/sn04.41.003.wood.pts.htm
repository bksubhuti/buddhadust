					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once a number of elder brethren were staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br/>
					in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather, went to visit those elder Brethren,<br/>
					and on coming to them<br/>
					saluted them<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated Citta, the housefather, said to those elder brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my lords the elders accept of me tomorrow's meal."</p>

					<p class="f4">And those elder brethren accepted by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[194]</b></span> Thereupon Citta, the housefather,<br/>
					understanding the acceptance of those elder Brethren,<br/>
					rose from his seat,<br/>
					saluted the elder brethren by the right<br/>
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the elder Brethren, when the night was gone,<br/>
					robed themselves at early dawn,<br/>
					and taking bowl and outer robe<br/>
					went to the dwelling of Citta, the housefather,<br/>
					and on reaching it<br/>
					sat down on seats prepared.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather, came to those elder Brethren,<br/>
					and saluting them<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the housefather,<br/>
					said to the venerable (chief) elder: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to these divers views<br/>
					that arise in the world, my lord elder,<br/>
					such as:</p>

					<p class="f4">Eternal is the world,<br/>
					not eternal is the world,<br/>
					finite is the world,<br/>
					infinite is the world,<br/>
					life and body are the same,<br/>
					life and body are different,<br/>
					the Tathāgata, exists after death,<br/>
					he exists not,<br/>
					he both exists and exists not,<br/>

					set forth in the Brahmajala,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> -</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the existence of what, lord,<br/>
					do these views prevail?</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the nonexistence of what<br/>
					do these views not prevail?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br/>
					the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time did Citta, the housefather,<br/>
					say to the venerable (chief) elder: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to these divers views<br/>

					<p class="f4">And a second time,<br/>
					at these words<br/>
					the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time did Citta, the housefather,<br/>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Isidatta<br/>
					was the junior of all that order of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Isidatta<br/>
					said to the venerable chief elder: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"My lord, may I reply<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Do you reply, Isidatta,<br/>
					to the question of Citta, the housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Then said the venerable Isidatta]:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, housefather, your question was this,<br/>
					was it not?</p>

					<p class="f4">'As to these divers views<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, housefather,<br/>

					<p class="f4">it is owing to the person-pack view<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> that <span class="f2 g"><b>[195]</b></span> they arise,<br/>

					<p class="f4">That is how, housefather, there is no person-pack view."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whence comes the worthy Isidatta,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> my lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I come from Avanti,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, there is at Avanti<br/>

					<p class="f4">Has your reverence seen him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have, housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray where, lord, does that venerable one now dwell?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am, housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then may the worthy Isidatta take his pleasure at Macchikasaṇḍa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lovely is Wild Mango Grove!</p>

					<p class="f4">I will do my best to supply the worthy Isidatta<br/>

					<p class="f4">"That is kindly said, housefather."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the housefather, was glad<br/>

					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then with his own hand<br/>
					he served and satisfied those elder brethren<br/>
					with food both hard and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those elder Brethren,<br/>
					having eaten their fill,<br/>
					withdrew their hands from their bowls,<br/>
					rose up<br/>
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable chief elder<br/>
					said to the venerable Isidatta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for you, friend,<br/>
					that this question arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">This question did not occur to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, friend Isidatta,<br/>
					if on another occasion such a question arises,<br/>
					do you reply in like manner."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Isidatta,<br/>
					having set his lodging in order,<br/>
					took bowl and outer robe<br/>
					and departed from Macchikasaṇḍa,<br/>
					and in thus departing from Macchikasaṇḍa<br/>
					he was gone for good<br/>
