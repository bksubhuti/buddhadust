					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Godatta<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> was staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br/>
					in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather, came to visit the venerable Godatta,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at <span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span> one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat, the venerable Godatta said to Citta, the housefather: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Housefather, this heart's release<br/>
					and this utterly unworldly<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> heart's release,<br/>
					and this heart's release<br/>
					that is by the void<br/>
					and that which is signless, -<br/>
					are these states diverse in spirit,<br/>
					diverse in letter,<br/>
					or are they the same both in spirit<br/>
					and in letter?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is one view of the question,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> sir,<br/>
					according to which these states<br/>
					are diverse both in spirit and in letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">But there is another view, sir,<br/>
