					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> Nāṭa's Son, had come to Macchikasaṇḍa together with a great company of the Nigaṇṭhas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Citta, the housefather, heard it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son, has come to Macchikasaṇḍa<br/>
					together with a great company of the Nigaṇṭhas."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Citta, the housefather, with a number of followers,<br/>
					went to visit the Nigaṇṭha, Nāṭa's Son,<br/>
					and on coming to him greeted him in friendly wise,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br/>
					the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son, said to Citta, the housefather:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hast thou faith, housefather,<br/>
					in the teaching of Gotama, the recluse,<br/>
					that there is a mental balance<br/>
					without thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that there is a ceasing<br/>
					of thought directed and sustained?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, sir, I do not walk with faith<br/>
					in the teaching<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> of Gotama, the recluse,<br/>
					that there is a mental balance<br/>
					without thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that there is a ceasing<br/>
					of thought directed and sustained."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son,<br/>
					looking round<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> on his own company, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would have you look, sirs,<br/>
					how straight is this housefather Citta,<br/>
					how guileless<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> is this housefather Citta,<br/>
					how ingenuous is this housefather Citta!</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, he who should think there can be any ceasing<br/>
					of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					might think the mind could be caught in a net,<br/>
					or that Gangā's stream<br/>
					could be held back with his own fist!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you sir?<br/>
					Which is the more excellent,<br/>
					knowledge or faith?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, housefather,<br/>
					knowledge is more excellent than faith."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Now I, sir, if I so desire,<br/>
					aloof from lusts,<br/>
					aloof from states that are evil,<br/>
					can enter upon the first trance,<br/>
					which is joined with thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of solitude,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and can abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br/>
					by the calming down<br/>
					of thought directed and sustained<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					by entering on the inward calm,<br/>
					that single-mindedness of will,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sained,<br/>
					born of mental blance,<br/>
					zestful and full of ease,<br/>
					can enter on the second trance and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br/>
					by the fading ut of zest<br/>
					become balanced<br/>
					and remain mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experience with the body<br/>
					the happiness of which the Ariyans aver:<br/>
					'The balanced thoughtful man dwells happily'<br/>
					can enter on the third trance and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br/>
					by abandoning ease and pain,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br/>
					can enter on the fourth trance<br/>
					which is free of pain and free of pleasure,<br/>
					a state of perfect purity of balance and equanimity,<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus knowing, sir,<br/>
					thus seeing,<br/>
					believing what other recluse or brahmin,<br/>
					should I hold<br/>
					that there is a mental balance<br/>
					without thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					or that there is a ceasing of thought directed and sustained?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words,<br/>
					the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son,<br/>
					looking around on his company, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would have you look, sirs,<br/>
					how crooked is this housefather,<br/>
					how crafty,<br/>
					how counterfeiting is this housefather Citta!"</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, indeed, sir, we understand your saying:<br/>
					'I would have ye look, sirs,<br/>
					how straight is this housefather Citta,<br/>
					how guileless,<br/>
					how honest is this housefather Citta.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And now indeed we understand your saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would have ye look, sirs,<br/>
					how crooked is this housefather Citta,<br/>
					how crafty,<br/>
					how dishonest is this housefather Citta.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, sir, your first assertion was true,<br/>
					your last was false.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if your last was true,<br/>
					your first was false.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now here, sir,<br/>
					these ten reasonable questions<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you know the way to <span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span> reply to them,<br/>
					you should give me a counter-blow<br/>
					along with your company.</p>

					<p class="f4">One question,<br/>
					one explanation,<br/>
					one answer.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Two questions,<br/>
					two explanations,<br/>
					two answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Three questions,<br/>
					three explanations,<br/>
					three answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four questions,<br/>
					four explanations,<br/>
					four answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Five questions,<br/>
					five explanations,<br/>
					five answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Six questions,<br/>
					six explanations,<br/>
					six answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven questions,<br/>
					seven explanations,<br/>
					seven answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Eight questions,<br/>
					eight explanations,<br/>
					eight answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nine questions,<br/>
					nine explanations,<br/>
					nine answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ten questions,<br/>
					ten explanations,<br/>
					ten answers."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather,<br/>
					getting no reply to these ten reasonable questions,<br/>
					rose up from his seat and went away.</p>
