					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Kassapa,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Unclothed,<br/>
					an old family friend,<br/>
					had come to Macchikasaṇḍa.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Citta, the housefather, heard it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They say our old family friend, Kassapa, the Unclothed,<br/>
					has come to Macchikasaṇḍa."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Citta, the housefather, went to visit Kassapa, the Unclothed,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him in friendly wise,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the housefather, said to Kassapa, the Unclothed:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How long have you been a Wanderer, worthy Kassapa?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Full thirty years, housefather,<br/>
					have I been a Wanderer."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In those thirty years, sir,<br/>
					have you come by any superhuman experience,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					any truly Ariyan excellence of knowledge and insight,<br/>
					any comfortable life?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In these full thirty years, housefather,<br/>
					that I have been a Wanderer,<br/>
					I have never come by any superhuman experience,<br/>
					nor any truly Ariyan excellence of knowledge and insight,<br/>
					nor any comfortable life, -<br/>
					nothing but nakedness<br/>
					and a shaven crown<br/>
					and dusting away the gravel."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[209]</b></span> At these words Citta, the housefather,<br/>
					said to Kassapa, the Unclothed: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"A strange thing indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">A wonder indeed,<br/>
					the good teaching of the Norm!</p>

					<p class="f4">To think that in full thirty years<br/>
					one should come by no superhuman experience,<br/>
					no truly Ariyan excellence of knowledge and insight,<br/>
					nor any comfortable life, -<br/>
					nothing but nakedness<br/>
					and a shaven crown<br/>
					and dusting away the gravel!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But you, housefather, -<br/>
					how long is it since you entered<br/>
					on the life of the disciple?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I too, sir, have been full thirty years a disciple."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But in those full thirty years, housefather,<br/>
					have you come by any superhuman experience,<br/>
					any truly Ariyan excellence of knowledge and insight,<br/>
					any comfortable life?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How should it not be so, sir?</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, when I so desire,<br/>
					aloof from lust,<br/>
					aloof from states that are evil,<br/>
					can enter upon the first trance,<br/>
					which is joined with thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of solitude,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, when I so desire,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					entering on the inward calm,<br/>
					that single-mindedness of will,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and fll of ease,<br/>
					can enter on the second trance<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br/>
					by the fading out of zest<br/>
					become balanced and remain mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiencing with the body<br/>
					the happiness of which the Arians aver:<br/>
					'The balanced thoughtful man dwells happily'<br/>
					can enter on the third trance<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br/>
					by rejecting pleasure and pain,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br/>
					can enter on the fourth trance<br/>
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, sir, if I should make an end<br/>
					earlier than the Exalted One,<br/>
					'twere no wonder if the Exalted One<br/>
					should pronounce thus of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no fetter,<br/>
					bound by which Citta, the housefather,<br/>
					could come back again to this world.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Kassapa, the Unclothed,<br/>
					said to Citta, the housefather: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"A strange thing, indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">A wonder, indeed,<br/>
					the good teaching of the Norm!</p>

					<p class="f4">To think that a householder,<br/>
					one who wears white clothes,<br/>
					should come to such superhuman experience,<br/>
					such truly Ariyan excellence of knowledge and wisdom,<br/>
					such comfortable living.</p>

					<p class="f4">Oh, housefather,<br/>
					may I get ordination in this Norm-discipline?</p>

					<p class="f4">May I get full ordination?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the housefather, took Kassapa, the Un- <span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span> clothed,<br/>
					to some elder brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">And on coming to them he said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sirs, this is Kassapa, the Unclothed,<br/>
					an old family friend of ours.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the elders ordain this man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them give him full ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">I for my part<br/>
					will do my best<br/>
					to supply the requisites of robes,<br/>
					alms<br/>
					and lodging,<br/>
					and comforts and medicines in time of sickness."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So Kassapa, the Unclothed, got ordination in the Norm-diseipline,<br/>
					got full ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after he was ordained<br/>
					did the venerable Kassapa,<br/>
					dwelling solitary,<br/>
					secluded,<br/>
					zealous,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and aspiring,<br/>
					in no<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> long time<br/>
					attain that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br/>
					to win which the clansmen<br/>
					rightly go forth from home to the homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">So that in that very life,<br/>
					of himself,<br/>
					he fully understood it,<br/>
					realized it<br/>
					and abode therein,<br/>
					and knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the righteous life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					for life in these conditions<br/>
					there is no hereafter."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Kassapa<br/>
					was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
