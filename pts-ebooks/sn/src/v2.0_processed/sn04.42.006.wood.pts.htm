					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Nalanda<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> in Pāvārika Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Asibandhaka's Son,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> the headman,<br/>
					came to see the Exalted One and,<br/>
					on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br/>
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the brahmins of the west,<br/>
					who are carriers of waterpots,<br/>
					wearers of lily-garlands,<br/>
					purifiers by water,<br/>
					fire-worshippers,<br/>
					when a man has died<br/>
					and made an end, -<br/>
					they lift him up<br/>
					and carry him out,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					call on him by name<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					and speed him heavenwards.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One,<br/>
					who is Arahant,<br/>
					an All-enlightened One,<br/>
					is able to bring it about<br/>
					that the whole world,<br/>
					when body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					can be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/>
					in the Heaven World."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to that, headman, I will question you.</p>

					<p class="f4">You may reply as you think fit.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a case<br/>
					where a man is a taker of life,<br/>
					a taker of what is not <span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span> given,<br/>
					a wrong-doer in respect of sensual passion,<br/>
					a liar,<br/>
					a backbiter,<br/>
					of bitter speech,<br/>
					a babbler<br/>
					and covetous,<br/>
					of malevolent heart,<br/>
					of perverted view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great multitude gathers<br/>
					and throngs together,<br/>
					aspires and praises him<br/>
					and goes about with uplifted palms,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May this man,<br/>
					when body breaks up,<br/>
					after death be reborn<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span> in the Happy Lot,<br/>
					in the Heaven World.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray would that man,<br/>
					owing to the aspirations and praises<br/>
					of that great multitude,<br/>
					owing to their going about<br/>
					with uplifted palms, -<br/>
					would that man,<br/>
					when body breaks up,<br/>
					after death be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/>
					in the Heaven World?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, headman, suppose a man hurls<br/>
					a huge, great rock<br/>
					into a deep,<br/>
					deep pool of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great multitude gathers<br/>
					and throngs together<br/>
					and aspires<br/>
					and praises it<br/>
					and goes about with uplifted palms,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rise up, good rock!</p>

					<p class="f4">Float up, good rock!</p>

					<p class="f4">Float ashore, good rock!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that huge, great rock,<br/>
					because of the aspirations,<br/>
					because of the praises,<br/>
					because of the going about with uplifted palms<br/>
					of that great multitude, -<br/>
					would it rise up or float up or float ashore?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, headman,<br/>
					whatever man is a taker of life,<br/>
					a taker of what is not given,<br/>
					a wrong-doer in respect of sensual passion,<br/>
					a liar,<br/>
					a backbiter,<br/>
					of bitter speech,<br/>
					a babbler<br/>
					and covetous,<br/>
					of malevolent heart,<br/>
					of perverted view, -<br/>
					however much a great multitude,<br/>
					gathering and thronging together,<br/>
					might aspire<br/>
					and praise him<br/>
					and go about with uplifted palms,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May this man, when body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/>
					in the Heaven World,'</p>

					<p class="f4">yet would that man,<br/>
					when body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					be reborn in the Woeful Lot,<br/>
					in the Downfall,<br/>
					in Purgatory.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that in this case<br/>
					in a man who abstains from taking life,<br/>
					who abstains from taking what is not given,<br/>
					who abstains from wrong action<br/>
					in respect of sensual passion,<br/>
					who abstains from lying,<br/>
					who abstains from backbiting,<br/>
					who abstains from <span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span> bitter speech and babbling,<br/>
					who is not covetous,<br/>
					not of malevolent heart,<br/>
					a man of right view, -<br/>
					then a great multitude,<br/>
					gathering and thronging together,<br/>
					aspire<br/>
					and praise him<br/>
					and go about with uplifted palms,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May this man, when body breaks up,<br/>

					<p class="f4">what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man,<br/>

					in Purgatory?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose again, headman,<br/>
					a man plunges a jar of butter<br/>
					or a jar of oil<br/>
					into a deep,<br/>
					deep pool of water,<br/>
					and breaks it,<br/>
					and it<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> becomes shreds<br/>

					and sinks down to the bottom:<br/>
					but the butter<br/>

					that was in it<br/>
					floats up to the top.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then suppose a great multitude,<br/>
					gathering and thronging together,<br/>
					aspires<br/>

					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sink down, good butter!</p>

					<p class="f4">Sink in, good butter!</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that butter and oil,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, headman,<br/>

					<p class="f4">yet would he be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/>

					<p class="f4">At these words Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br/>
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br/>
					or show forth what is hidden,<br/>
					or point out the way<br/>
					to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br/>
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br/>
					even so in divers ways<br/>
					hath the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge,<br/>
					to the Norm<br/>
					and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br/>
					as a lay disciple,<br/>
					as one who hath gone to him for refuge,<br/>
					from this day forth<br/>
					so long as life doth last."</p>
