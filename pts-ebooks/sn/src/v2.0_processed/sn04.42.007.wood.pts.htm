					<hr />

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Nalanda in Pāvārika Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br/>
					came to see <span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span> the Exalted One and,<br/>
					on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br/>
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Does not the Exalted One, lord,<br/>
					dwell in compassion for every living thing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, headman, the Tathāgata,<br/>
					dwells in compassion for every living thing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, does the Exalted One<br/>
					teach the Norm in full<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					to certain ones,<br/>
					but to certain others<br/>
					he does not teach the Norm in full?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, headman, as to this<br/>
					I shall question you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you reply as you think fit.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a yeoman farmer<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> here<br/>
					has three fields,<br/>
					one excellent,<br/>
					one moderate,<br/>
					and one poor,<br/>
					hard,<br/>
					saltish,<br/>
					of bad soil</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">When that yeoman farmer wants to sow his seed,<br/>
					which field would he sow first,<br/>
					the excellent field,<br/>
					the moderate field,<br/>
					or the one that is poor,<br/>
					hard,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					saltish,<br/>
					of bad soil?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"That yeoman farmer, lord,<br/>
					wishing to sow his seed,<br/>
					would first sow the excellent field,<br/>
					and having done so<br/>
					he would sow the moderate one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having so done<br/>
					he might and might not sow that field<br/>
					that is poor,<br/>
					hard,<br/>
					saltish,<br/>
					of bad soil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because in any case<br/>
					it might do for cattle-food."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, headman, just like that excellent field<br/>
					are my ordained disciples,<br/>
					both men and women.</p>

					<p class="f4">I teach them the Norm<br/>
					that is lovely in its beginning,<br/>
					lovely in its middle<br/>
					and lovely in its ending,<br/>
					both in spirit and in letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">I make known to them<br/>
					the righteous life<br/>
					that is wholly perfect<br/>
					and utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, headman,<br/>
					these people abide with me for their island,<br/>
					with me for their cave of shelter,<br/>
					me for their stronghold,<br/>
					me for their refuge.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, headman,<br/>
					just like that moderate field<br/>
					are my lay-disciples,<br/>
					both men and women.</p>

					<p class="f4">I teach them the Norm<br/>
					that is lovely in its beginning,<br/>
					lovely in its middle<br/>
					and lovely in its ending,<br/>
					both in spirit and in letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">I make known <span class="f2 g"><b>[222]</b></span> to them<br/>
					the righteous life<br/>
					that is wholly perfect<br/>
					and utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, headman,<br/>
					these people abide with me for their island,<br/>
					with me for their cave of shelter,<br/>
					me for their stronghold,<br/>
					me for their refuge.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, headman,<br/>
					just like that field that is poor,<br/>
					hard,<br/>
					saltish,<br/>
					of bad soil,<br/>
					are my<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> wandering recluses and brahmins<br/>
					that hold other views than mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">To them also I teach the Norm<br/>
					that is lovely in its beginning,<br/>
					lovely in its middle<br/>
					and lovely in its ending,<br/>
					both in spirit and in letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">I make known to them<br/>
					the righteous life<br/>
					that is wholly perfect<br/>
					and utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because if so be they understand<br/>
					but a single sentence of it,<br/>
					that would be to their profit and happiness<br/>
					for many a long day.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, headman,<br/>
					suppose a man has three waterpots,<br/>
					one not cracked,<br/>
					not leaky,<br/>
					not letting (water) run to waste -<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					and one waterpot not cracked,<br/>
					but leaky<br/>
					and letting water run to waste:<br/>
					and one waterpot that is both cracked and leaky,<br/>
					and letting water run to waste.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">If that man wants to store up water,<br/>
					which pöt would he put it in first, -<br/>
					in the one that is not cracked,<br/>
					not leaky,<br/>
					not letting water run to waste?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would he put it in the pot<br/>
					that is not cracked,<br/>
					but leaky,<br/>
					letting water run to waste?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would he put it in the one<br/>
					that is both cracked and leaky,<br/>
					and letting water run to waste?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, lord, that man would first store his water -<br/>
					in the one that is not cracked,<br/>
					not leaky,<br/>
					not letting water run to waste,<br/>
					then in the pot<br/>
					that is not cracked,<br/>
					but leaky,<br/>
					letting water run to waste, and as to the one<br/>
					that is both cracked and leaky,<br/>
					and letting water run to waste<br/>
					he might or he might not put it in that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">At any rate the water<br/>
					might do for washing pots."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, brahmin, just like that waterpot<br/>
					that is not cracked,<br/>
					not leaky,<br/>
					not letting water run to waste<br/>
					are my ordained disciples,<br/>
					both men and women.</p>

					<p class="f4">I teach them the Norm<br/>

					<p class="f4">At these words Asibandhaka's Son<br/>
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br/>
					or show forth what is hidden,<br/>
					or point out the way<br/>
					to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br/>
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br/>
					even so in divers ways<br/>
					hath the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge,<br/>
					to the Norm and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br/>
					as a lay disciple,<br/>
					as one who hath gone to him for refuge,<br/>
					from this day forth<br/>
					so long as life doth last."</p>
