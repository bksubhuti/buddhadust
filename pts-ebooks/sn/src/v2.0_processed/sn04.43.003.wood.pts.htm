					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, Brethren, the Uncompounded<br/>
					and the path that goes to the Uncompounded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is the Uncompounded?</p>

					<p class="f4">The destruction of lust, Brethren,<br/>
					the destruction of hatred,<br/>
					the destruction of illusion, -<br/>
					that is called the Uncompounded.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is the path<br/>
					that goes to the Uncompounded?</p>

					<p class="f4">Concentration<br/>
					accompanied by thought directed and sustained:<br/>
					concentration<br/>
					without directed,<br/>
					but just with sustained, thought:<br/>
					concentration that is without thought<br/>
					either directed or sustained.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That, Brethren, is called<br/>
					'the path that goes to the Uncompounded.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Brethren, have I taught ye the Uncompounded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I taught ye the way that goes to the Uncompounded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever should be done<br/>
					by a teacher that seeks the welfare of his disciples,<br/>
					in compassion,<br/>
					feeling compassion,<br/>
					that have I done for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Brethren, are the roots of trees.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are empty places.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you meditate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not remiss.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not remorseful hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is our instruction to you.</p>
