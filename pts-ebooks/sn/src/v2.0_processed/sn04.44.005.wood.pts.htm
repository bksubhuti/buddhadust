					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great were staying at Benares,<br/>
					in Isipatana,<br/>
					at Antelope Wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great,<br/>
					rising at eventide from his solitary meditation,<br/>
					came to see the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					and on coming to him,<br/>
					after the exchange of friendly greetings<br/>
					and the compliments of courtesy,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Kotthita the Great said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"How now, friend Sāriputta?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does the Tathāgata, exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, not exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is unrevealed by the Exalted One, friend."</p>
