					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Wanderer, Vacchagotta, came to visit the Exalted One<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of civilities<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer, Vacchagotta,<br/>
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, master Gotama,<br/>
					is there a self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Exalted One was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, then, master Gotama,<br/>
					is there not a self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">For a second time also the Exalted One was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Vacchagotta the Wanderer rose from his seat and went away.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of Vacchagotta the Wanderer<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, lord,<br/>
					that the Exalted One gave no answer<br/>
					to the question of Vacchagotta the Wanderer?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[282]</b></span> "If, Ānanda, when asked by the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there a self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I had replied to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is a self,'</p>

					<p class="f4">then, Ānanda,<br/>
					that would be siding<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					with the recluses and brahmins<br/>
					who are eternalists.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if, Ānanda, when asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there not a self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I had replied that</p>

					<p class="f4">'It does not exist',</p>

					<p class="f4">that, Ānanda, would be siding<br/>
					with those recluses and brahmins<br/>
					who are annihilationists.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, when asked by the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there a self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">had I replied that</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is',</p>

					<p class="f4">would my reply be in accordance with the knowledge<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					that</p>

					<p class="f4">'All things are not-self'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, Ānanda, when asked by the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there not a self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">had I replied that</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is not',</p>

					<p class="f4">it would have been more bewilderment<br/>
					for the bewildered Vacchagotta.</p>

					<p class="f4">For he would have said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Formerly indeed I had a self,<br/>
					but now I have not one any more.'"</p>
