					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The whole of the holy life, lord,<br/>
					consists in friendship,<br/>
					in association,<br/>
					in intimacy with what is lovely."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said! Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">The whole,<br/>
					consists in friendship,<br/>
					in association,<br/>
					in intimacy with what is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a monk who is a friend,<br/>
					an associate,<br/>
					an intimate<br/>
					of what is lovely<br/>
					we may expect this, -<br/>
					that he will develop the Ariyan eightfold way,<br/>
					that he will make much of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Sāriputta, does such a monk<br/>
					develop and make much of<br/>
					the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Sāriputta, he cultivates right view,<br/>
					which is based on detachment,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right aim,<br/>
					which is based on detachment,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">likewise right speech,<br/>
					which is based on detachment,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right action,<br/>
					which is based on detachment,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right living,<br/>
					which is based on detachment,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right effort,<br/>
					which is based on detachment,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness,<br/>
					which is based on detachment,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration,<br/>
					which is based on detachment,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Sāriputta, is how a monk who is a friend,<br/>
					an associate,<br/>
					an intimate of what is lovely,<br/>
					cultivates and makes much of<br/>
					the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the method, Sāriputta,<br/>
					by which you are to understand<br/>
					how the whole of this holy life<br/>
					consists in friendship,<br/>
					in association,<br/>
					in intimacy<br/>
					with what is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Sāriputta, beings liable to rebirth<br/>
					are liberated from rebirth;<br/>
					beings liable to decay,<br/>
					liable to death,<br/>
					liable to grief,<br/>
					woe,<br/>
					lamentation<br/>
					and despair,<br/>
					are liberated therefrom<br/>
					because of my friendship with what is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by this method, Sāriputta,<br/>
					that you are to understand how<br/>
					the whole of this holy life<br/>
					consists in friendship,<br/>
					in association,<br/>
					in intimacy with what is lovely."</p>
