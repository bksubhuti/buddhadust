					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of monks came to visit the Exalted One<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, lord, the wanderers holding other views<br/>
					ask us this question:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is it, friends,<br/>
					for which the holy life is lived<br/>
					under Gotama the recluse?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned, lord,<br/>
					we thus reply to those wanderers holding other views:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is for the full understanding of ill, friends,<br/>
					that the holy life is lived<br/>
					under Gotama the recluse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned, lord,<br/>
					and thus replying,<br/>
					do we state the views of the Exalted One,<br/>
					without misrepresenting the Exalted One<br/>
					by stating an untruth?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do we answer in accordance<br/>
					with his teaching,<br/>
					so that no one who agrees with his teaching<br/>
					and follows his views<br/>
					could incur reproach?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truly, monks, thus questioned<br/>
					and thus replying,<br/>
					ye do state my views<br/>
					without misrepresenting me<br/>
					by stating an untruth.</p>

					<p class="f4">You do answer in accordance<br/>
					with my teaching,<br/>
					so that no one who agrees with my teaching<br/>
					and follows my views<br/>
					could incur reproach<br/>
					in stating that it is for the full understanding of Ill<br/>
					that the holy life is lived under my rule.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But if, monks, the wanderers holding other views<br/>
					should thus question you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But, friends, is there any way,<br/>
					is there any practice<br/>
					for the full understanding of this Ill?' -</p>

					<p class="f4">thus questioned, monks,<br/>
					thus should ye reply to those wanderers of other views:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, there is indeed a Way,<br/>
					there is indeed a practice<br/>
					for the full understanding of this ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is that Way,<br/>
					what that practice?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this very Ariyan eightfold way;<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the Way,<br/>
					this is the practice<br/>
					for the full understanding of this Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned, monks,<br/>
					thus should ye reply<br/>
					to those wanderers holding other views."</p>
