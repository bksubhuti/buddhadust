					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, monks, the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will analyze it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give careful heed and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," said those monks in assent to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One then said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, monks, is the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is<br/>
					right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right concentration.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is right view?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the knowledge of Ill,<br/>
					knowledge of the arising of ill,<br/>
					knowledge <span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span> of the ceasing of ill,<br/>
					and knowledge of the practice leading to the ceasing of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is called 'right view.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is right aim?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the aim to renounce,<br/>
					the aim to be free from malice,<br/>
					the aim to be harmless.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is called 'right aim.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is right speech?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the avoiding of lying speech,<br/>
					the avoiding of calumny,<br/>
					of cutting speech,<br/>
					of wanton speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is called 'right speech.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is right action?</p>

						

					<p class="f4">It is the avoiding of taking life,<br/>
					the avoiding of stealing,<br/>
					the avoiding of unchastity.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is called 'right action.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is right living?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					by abandoning a wrong way of life,<br/>
					gets his living by a right way of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is called 'right living.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is right effort?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk puts forth desire [to do],<br/>
					makes an effort,<br/>
					begins to strive,<br/>
					applies his mind,<br/>
					lays hold of his mind<br/>
					to prevent the arising of ill,<br/>
					unprofitable states<br/>
					not yet arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to ill,<br/>
					unprofitable states that have arisen,<br/>
					he puts forth desire<br/>
					makes an effort,<br/>
					begins to strive,<br/>
					applies his mind,<br/>
					lays hold of his mind<br/>
					to destroy them.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to profitable states<br/>
					that have not yet arisen,<br/>
					he puts forth desire<br/>
					makes an effort,<br/>
					begins to strive,<br/>
					applies his mind,<br/>
					lays hold of his mind<br/>
					for their arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to profitable states<br/>
					that have already arisen,<br/>
					he puts forth desire,<br/>
					makes an effort,<br/>
					begins to strive,<br/>
					applies his mind,<br/>
					lays hold of his mind<br/>
					for their continuance,<br/>
					for their non-confusion,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					for their more-becoming,<br/>
					increase,<br/>
					culture<br/>
					and fulfilment.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is called 'right effort.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is right mindfulness?<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk abides contemplating body in body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed,<br/>
					mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abides contemplating feelings in feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed,<br/>
					mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

						

					<p class="f4">He abides contemplating mind in mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed,<br/>
					mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abides contemplating mind-states in mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed,<br/>
					mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called 'right mindfulness.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[9]</b></span> And what, monks, is right concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, aloof from sensuality,<br/>
					aloof from evil states,<br/>
					enters on the first trance,<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of solitude,<br/>
					easeful and zestful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					he enters on the inward calm,<br/>
					that one-pointedness of mind,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					that is the second trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					he abides indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences ease through the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having entered on the third trance,<br/>
					which the Ariyans describe in these terms:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He who is indifferent and mindful dwells happily,"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the abandoning of ease,<br/>
					by the abandoning of discomfort,<br/>
					by the destruction of the happiness and unhappiness<br/>
					that he had before,<br/>
					having entered on that state<br/>
					which is neither pleasant nor painful,<br/>
					that utter purity of mindfulness<br/>
					reached by indifference,<br/>
					which is the fourth trance,<br/>
					he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called 'right concentration.'"</p>
