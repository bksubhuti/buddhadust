					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Nandiya<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the wanderer came to the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on reaching him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Nandiya the wanderer<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What conditions are there, master Gotama,<br/>
					which when cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					lead to Nibbāna,<br/>
					have Nibbāna for their goal,<br/>
					end in Nibbāna?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are eight conditions, Nandiya,<br/>
					which when cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					lead to Nibbāna,<br/>
					have Nibbāna for their goal,<br/>
					end in Nibbāna,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">These eight conditions, Nandiya, when cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					lead to Nibbāna,<br/>
					have Nibbāna for their goal,<br/>
					end in Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Nandiya the wanderer said this to the-Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span> "Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as one raises what is fallen<br/>
					or shows forth what is hidden,<br/>
					or points out the way<br/>
					to him that wanders astray,<br/>
					or holds up a light in the darkness<br/>
					so that they who have eyes may see objects,<br/>
					— even so in divers ways<br/>
					has Dhamma, been set forth<br/>
					by master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself go for refuge to Gotama,<br/>
					the Exalted One,<br/>
					to the Norm<br/>
					and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama accept me as a lay disciple,<br/>
					as one who has gone to him for refuge<br/>
					from this day forth,<br/>
					so long as I have life."</p>
