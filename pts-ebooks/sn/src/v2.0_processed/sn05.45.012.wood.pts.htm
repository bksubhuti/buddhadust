					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I desire to dwell in solitude<br/>
					for three months.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not to be visited by any<br/>
					save by him alone who brings my food."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord"<br/>
					replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus no one visited the Exalted One<br/>
					save the one who brought his food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at the end of those three months the Exalted One,<br/>
					leaving his solitude,<br/>
					addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I have been dwelling partly<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					in the same manner as I did<br/>
					after I first attamed enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I came to know<br/>
					what is experienced as a result of wrong view,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong view,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of right view<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right view,<br/>
					what is experienced as a result of wrong aim,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong aim,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of right aim<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right aim,<br/>
					what is experienced as a result of wrong speech,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong speech,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of right speech<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right speech,<br/>
					what is experienced as a result of wrong action,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong action,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of right action<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right action,<br/>
					what is experienced as a result of wrong living,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong living,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of right living<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right living,<br/>
					what is experienced as a result of wrong effort,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong effort,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of right effort<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right effort,<br/>
					what is experienced as a result of wrong mindfulness,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong mindfulness,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of right mindfulness<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right mindfulness,<br/>
					what is experienced as a result of wrong concentration,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing wrong concentration,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of right concentration:<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise I came to know what is experienced as a result of desire,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing desire,<br/>
					what is experienced as a result of directed thought,<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing directed thought,<br/>
					what is experienced as a result of perception.<br/>
					and what is experienced as a result of suppressing perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">When desire is not suppressed,<br/>
					directed thought is not suppressed,<br/>
					perception is not suppressed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to these<br/>
					there is experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">(When desire is suppressed,<br/>
					but directed thought<br/>
					and perception<br/>
					are not suppressed,<br/>
					owing to these<br/>
					there is experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">When desire<br/>
					and directed thought<br/>
					are suppressed,<br/>
					but not perception,<br/>
					then there is experience.)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When desire<br/>
					and directed thought<br/>
					and perception,<br/>
					are suppressed,<br/>
					owing to that there is experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has not attained<br/>
					there is the effort to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">When that state is attained,<br/>
					owing to that there is experience."</p>
