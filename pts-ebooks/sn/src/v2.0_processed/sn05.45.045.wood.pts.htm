					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great number of monks came to see the Exalted One<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side the Exalted One said to them: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if the wanderers holding other views should thus question you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is it, friends, for which the holy life is lived<br/>
					under (the rule of) Gotama the recluse?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned, monks,<br/>
					ye should reply thus<br/>
					to those wanderers of other views:</p>

					<p class="f4">'With the aim of destruction of the āsavas, friends,<br/>
					the holy life is lived<br/>
					under the rule of Gotama the recluse.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But if, monks, the wanderers of other views<br/>
					should thus question you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But, friends, is there a way,<br/>
					is there a practice<br/>
					leading to the destruction of the āsavas?' -</p>

					<p class="f4">thus questioned, monks,<br/>
					thus should ye make reply<br/>
					to those wanderers of other views:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, there is indeed a way,<br/>
					there is indeed a practice<br/>
					leading to the destruction of the āsavas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the way,<br/>
					what the practice<br/>
					leading to the destruction of the āsavas?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just this Ariyan eightfold way,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness<br/>
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the way,<br/>
					this is the practice<br/>
					leading to the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned, monks,<br/>
					thus should ye make reply<br/>
					to those wanderers holding other views."</p>
