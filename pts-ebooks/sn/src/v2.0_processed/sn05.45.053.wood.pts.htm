					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, the dawn<br/>
					is the forerunner,<br/>
					the harbinger,<br/>
					of the arising of the sun,<br/>
					even so insight<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> is the forerunner,<br/>
					the harbinger,<br/>
					of the arising of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a monk who has insight, monks,<br/>
					it may be expected that he will cultivate<br/>
					the Ariyan eightfold way,<br/>
					that he will make much of<br/>
					the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk who has insight<br/>
					cultivate and make much of<br/>
					the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates right view,<br/>
					that is based on seclusion,<br/>
					that is based on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right aim,<br/>
					that is based on seclusion,<br/>
					that is based on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right speech,<br/>
					that is based on seclusion,<br/>
					that is based on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right action,<br/>
					that is based on seclusion,<br/>
					that is based on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right living,<br/>
					that is based on seclusion,<br/>
					that is based on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right effort,<br/>
					that is based on seclusion,<br/>
					that is based on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness,<br/>
					that is based on seclusion,<br/>
					that is based on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration,<br/>
					that is based on seclusion,<br/>
					that is based on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Ānanda, is how a monk who has insight<br/>
					cultivates and makes much of<br/>
					the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>
