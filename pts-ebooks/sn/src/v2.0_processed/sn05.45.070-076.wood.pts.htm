					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is one condition, monks,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Of the monk who is a friend of the lovely, monks,<br/>
					it may be expected that he will cultivate<br/>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates right view,<br/>
					which ends in the restraint of passion,<br/>
