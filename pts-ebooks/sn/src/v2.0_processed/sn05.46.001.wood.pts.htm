					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Supported, monks, by Himalaya,<br/>
					lord of mountains,<br/>
					snakes grow a body<br/>
					and get strength.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they have grown a body<br/>
					and got strength there,<br/>
					they go down to the tarns.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the tarns<br/>
					they go down to the lakes,</p>

					<p class="f4">From the lakes<br/>
					they go down to the small rivers,</p>

					<p class="f4">From the small rivers<br/>
					they go down to the great rivers,</p>

					<p class="f4">From the great rivers<br/>
					they go down to the sea,<br/>
					they go down to the mighty ocean.</p>

					<p class="f4">There they get great size and growth of body.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, monks, a monk supported by virtue,<br/>
					fixed in virtue,<br/>
					cultivating the seven limbs of wisdom<br/>
					and making much of them,<br/>
					wins to greatness and growth in conditions.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a monk supported by virtue,<br/>
					fixed in virtue,<br/>
					cultivating the seven limbs of wisdom<br/>
					and making much of them,<br/>
					wins to greatness and growth in conditions?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is mindfulness,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is energy,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is zest,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is tranquillity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is concentration,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk supported by virtue,<br/>
