					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brother monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," replied those monks to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, there are these seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is Norm-investigation,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the seven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these seven limbs of wisdom, friends,<br/>
					in whichsoever I desire to abide<br/>
					during the early part of the day,<br/>
					in that limb of wisdom<br/>
					I abide.</p>

					<p class="f4">In whichsoever limb of wisdom<br/>
					I desire to abide<br/>
					in the middle of the day,<br/>
					in that I abide.</p>

					<p class="f4">In whichsoever limb of wisdom<br/>
					I desire to abide<br/>
					in the evening,<br/>
					in that I abide.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, friends, it is the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
					in such case I fully know that it is boundless in me,<br/>
					or that it is well begun in me, or,<br/>
					when it is established in me,<br/>
					I fully know that it is so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, if it fails me,<br/>
					I fully know that it is owing to this or <span class="f2 g"><b>[59]</b></span> that cause.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">If, friends, it is the limb of wisdom that is Norm-investigation,<br/>
					in such case I fully know that it is boundless in me,<br/>
					or that it is well begun in me, or,<br/>
					when it is established in me,<br/>
					I fully know that it is so.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like the wardrobe of a rajah<br/>
					or great nobleman,<br/>
					full of garments of various hues.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever suit he desires to don in the forenoon,<br/>
					that he dons in the forenoon.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever suit he desires to don at midday,<br/>
					that he dons at midday.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever suit he desires to don at eventide,<br/>
					that he dons at eventide.</p>
