					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then a certain monk came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated that monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Wisdom limb! Wisdom limb!' is the saying, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far is this name applicable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They conduce to wisdom, monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why they are so called.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is mindfulness,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is energy,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is zest,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is tranquillity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is concentration,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is equanimity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he cultivates these seven limbs of wisdom<br/>
					he frees his heart from the <i>āsava</i> of sensuality,<br/>
					from the <i>āsava</i> of becoming,<br/>
					from the <i>āsava</i> of nescience.</p>

					<p class="f4">The knowledge comes to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Freed am I by being freed'<br/>
					so that he fully knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Cut off is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They conduce to wisdom, monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why they are so called."</p>
