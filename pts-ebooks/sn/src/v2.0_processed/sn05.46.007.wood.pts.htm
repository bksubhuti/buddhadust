					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, monks, in a peaked house<br/>
					all rafters whatsoever<br/>
					go together to the peak,<br/>
					slope to the peak,<br/>
					join in the peak,<br/>
					and of them all<br/>
					the peak is reckoned chief,<br/>
					even so, monks, the monk<br/>
					who cultivates and makes much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/>
					slopes to Nibbāna,<br/>
					inclines to Nibbāna,<br/>
					tends to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk<br/>
					who cultivates and makes much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom<br/>
					slope to Nibbāna,<br/>
					incline to Nibbāna,<br/>
					tend to Nibbāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is mindfulness,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is energy,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is zest,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is tranquillity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is concentration,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is equanimity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus cultivated and made much of, monks,<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom<br/>
					slope to Nibbāna,<br/>
					incline to Nibbāna,<br/>
					tend to Nibbāna."</p>
