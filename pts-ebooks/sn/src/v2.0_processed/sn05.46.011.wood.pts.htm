					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, monks, whatsoever creatures adopt the four postures,<br/>
					now going,<br/>
					now standing still,<br/>
					now sitting,<br/>
					now lying,<br/>
					all do so in dependence on the earth;<br/>
					even so, monks,<br/>
					dependent on virtue,<br/>
					supported by virtue,<br/>
					does a monk cultivate the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/>
					make much of the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a monk,<br/>
					dependent on virtue,<br/>
					supported by virtue,<br/>
					cultivate and make much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is mindfulness,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is energy,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is zest,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is tranquillity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is concentration,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is equanimity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk,<br/>
					dependent on virtue,<br/>
					supported by virtue,<br/>
					cultivates and makes much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom."</p>
