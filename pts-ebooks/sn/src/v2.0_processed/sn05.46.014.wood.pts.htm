					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					in Bamboo Grove<br/>
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Kassapa the Great was staying in Pepper Tree Grotto,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					and was sick,<br/>
					afflicted,<br/>
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/>
					rising from his solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to visit the venerable Kassapa the Great,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One as he sat<br/>
					said to the venerable Kassapa the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Kassapa, I hope you are bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br/>
					and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating<br/>
					and not increasing?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating,<br/>
					but of their increasing."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[67]</b></span> "Kassapa, these seven limbs of wisdom<br/>
					fully expounded by myself,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom, Kassapa, that is mindfulness,<br/>
					fully expounded by myself,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					fully expounded by myself,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					fully expounded by myself,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					fully expounded by myself,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>
					fully expounded by myself,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is equanimity,<br/>
					fully expounded by myself,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven limbs of wisdom, Kassapa,<br/>
					fully expounded by myself,<br/>
					if cultivated,<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, lord, they are limbs of wisdom!</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, O Happy One, they are limbs of wisdom!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br/>
					and the venerable Kassapa the Great was delighted thereat,<br/>
					and took pleasure in what was said by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Kassapa the Great<br/>
					rose up from that sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">There and then<br/>
					that sickness of the venerable Kassapa the Great<br/>
					was abandoned.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> A good example of the reduction to formulae. <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> iii, 119; iv, 46 = <i>K.S.</i> iv, 23, 30. It seems unlikely that on such an occasion the Master would thus expound to this old follower teachings which he must have known by heart. In this Collection the sick man is generally introduced to serve as an occasion for emphasizing a fresh doctrine. <i>Comy.</i> adds: 'He had (it is said) carefully listened to this teaching about the seven limbs of wisdom, and seven days from his taking the robes he penetrated the truth about them, and they were manifested to him. Now, as he pondered on the profit of the Master's teaching, his blood was calmed, his system purified, and the sickness fell away like a drop of water from a lotus leaf.'</p>
