					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha<br/>
					in Bamboo Grove<br/>
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					the Exalted One<br/>
					and was sick,<br/>
					afflicted,<br/>
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Cunda the Great<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>
					the Exalted One said to the venerable Cunda the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Cunda, call to mind<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> the limbs of wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"These seven limbs of wisdom, lord,<br/>
					fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/>
					if cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom, lord, that is mindfulness,<br/>
					fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>
					fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is equanimity,<br/>
					fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/>
					when cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven limbs of wisdom, lord,<br/>
					fully expounded by the Exalted One,<br/>
					if cultivated,<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to full comprehension,<br/>
					to wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, Cunda, they are limbs of wisdom!</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Cunda, they are limbs of wisdom!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake Cunda the Great,<br/>
					and the Master was <br/>
					approving of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One rose up from that sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">There and then that sickness of the Exalted One was abandoned.</p>
