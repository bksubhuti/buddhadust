					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These seven limbs of wisdom, monks,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to no more going to the hither<br/>
					or the further shore.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is equinimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven limbs of wisdom, monks,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to no more going to the hither<br/>
					or the further shore."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying, the Happy One added this further as Teacher:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Few are they of mortal men<br/>
							Who have reached the further shore:<br/>
							But the crowd of other folk<br/>
							On this side fare up and down.<br/>
							They who follow in the teaching<br/>
							Of the Norm expounded well,<br/>
							They shall reach the shore and pass<br/>
							The realm of Death so hard to cross.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Giving up the state of darkness<br/>
							Let the wise pursue the light:<br/>
							Giving up home for the homeless,<br/>
							In solitude where joys are rare,<br/>
							Let him long for bliss unbounded.<br/>
							Leaving lusts and owning naught<br/>
							Let the wise man cleanse himself<br/>
							From the passions of the heart.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">They whose mind is rightly cultured<br/>
							In the wisdom's (seven) limbs, -<br/>
							Glad to have surrendered clinging,<br/>
							Glad to be from bondage loosed,<br/>
							Canker-cured, they, all-resplendent,<br/>
							E'en in this world are at peace.</p>
