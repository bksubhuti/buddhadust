					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, monks,<br/>
					seven conditions that lead to non-decline.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, are those<br/>
					seven conditions that lead to non-decline?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are<br/>
					the seven conditions that lead to non-decline.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward reads the <i>'aparihāni'</i> (his 'undeclining') of the title for the body of the text's <i>'aparihāniya'</i> that is, here, 'that lead to non-decline' to which I have changed it. Left as it was ("seven conditions that decline not") it would refer to the non-declining of the seven, but what is being spoken of is the non-decline of states in the practitioner.</p>
