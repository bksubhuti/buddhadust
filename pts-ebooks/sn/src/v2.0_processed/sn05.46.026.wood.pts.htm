					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The way, monks,<br/>
					and the practice leading thereto<br/>
					which conduces to the destruction of craving, -<br/>
					do ye cultivate that way and practice.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the way, monks,<br/>
					what the practice<br/>
					that so conduces?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
