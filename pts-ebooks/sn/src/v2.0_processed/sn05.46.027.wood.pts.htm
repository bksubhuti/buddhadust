					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The way, monks,<br/>
					and the practice leading thereto<br/>
					which conduces to the cessation of craving, -<br/>
					do ye cultivate that way and practice.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the way, monks,<br/>
					what the practice<br/>
					that so conduces?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is equinimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how cultivated,<br/>
					how made much of,<br/>
					do the seven limbs of wisdom<br/>
					conduce to the cessation<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> of craving?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is mindfulness,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is energy,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>

					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
