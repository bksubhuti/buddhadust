					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, monks,<br/>
					the way concerned with penetration.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is that<br/>
					way concerned with penetration?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>

					how made much of,<br/>
					do these seven limbs of wisdom<br/>
					conduce to penetration?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, Udayi, a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
