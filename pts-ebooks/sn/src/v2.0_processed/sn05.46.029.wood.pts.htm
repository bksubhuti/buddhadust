					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I behold not, monks, any other single condition which,<br/>
					thus cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					is so conducive to abandonment<br/>
					of the conditions that bind<br/>
					as the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is equinimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how cultivated, monks,<br/>
					how made much of<br/>
					do the seven limbs of wisdom<br/>
					conduce to the abandonment<br/>
					of conditions that bind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that mindfulness,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, are the conditions that bind?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/>
					that bind and cleave to one.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/>

					<p class="f4">The nose, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/>
					that bind and cleave to one.</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/>
					that bind and cleave to one.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/>
					that bind and cleave to one.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br/>
					that bind and cleave to one.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are called<br/>
					'conditions that bind.'"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
