					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever conditions, monks,<br/>
					are the constituent parts of good and bad,<br/>
					but are on the side of goodness,<br/>
					all of them have their root in systematic attention,<br/>
					converge in systematic attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of those conditions<br/>
					systematic attention is reckoned chief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a monk who possesses systematic attention<br/>
					we may expect that he will cultivate<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/>
					that he will make much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk<br/>
					who is possessed of systematic attention<br/>
					cultivate and make much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is mindfulness,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is energy,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is zest,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is tranquillity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is concentration,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is equanimity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk<br/>
					who is possessed of systematic attention<br/>
					cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/>
					makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom."</p>
