					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five checks,<br/>
					hindrances<br/>
					and corruptions of the heart,<br/>
					which weaken insight.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensual desire, monks, is a check,<br/>
					hindrance<br/>
					and corruption of the heart,<br/>
					that weakens insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Malevolence, is a check,<br/>
					hindrance<br/>
					and corruption of the heart,<br/>
					that weakens insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sloth and torpor, is a check,<br/>
					hindrance<br/>
					and corruption of the heart,<br/>
					that weakens insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excitement and flurry, is a check,<br/>
					hindrance<br/>
					and corruption of the heart,<br/>
					that weakens insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Doubt and wavering, is a check,<br/>
					hindrance<br/>
					and corruption of the heart,<br/>
					that weakens insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These five are checks,<br/>
					hindrances<br/>
					and corruptions of the heart,<br/>
					which weaken insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">The seven limbs of wisdom, monks,<br/>
					if unrestrained,<br/>
					unhindered,<br/>

					and made much of<br/>
					with uncorrupted heart,<br/>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
