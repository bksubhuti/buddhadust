					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now a certain brother came to see the Exalted One<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side<br/>
					he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"'A poor wretch!'</p>

					<p class="f4">A poor wretch!'<br/>
					is the saying, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far is this name applicable?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[84]</b></span> "By the fact, monk, of not cultivating,<br/>
					not making much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/>
					one is called 'A poor wretch.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>
					the limb of wisdom that is equinimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the fact, monk, of not cultivating,<br/>
					not making much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br/>
					one is called 'A poor wretch.'"</p>
