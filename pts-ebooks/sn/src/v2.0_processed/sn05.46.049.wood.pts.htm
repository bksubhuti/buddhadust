					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As a matter concerning one's own self,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> monks,<br/>
					I see no other single factor so potent<br/>
					for the arising of the seven limbs of wisdom<br/>
					as systematic attention.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span> Of a monk who is possessed of systematic attention<br/>
					we may expect that he will cultivate,<br/>
					that be will make much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a monk<br/>
					who is possessed of systematic attention,<br/>
					cultivate and make much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is mindfulness,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is energy,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is zest,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is tranquillity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is concentration,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br/>
					that is equanimity,<br/>
					which is based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk,<br/>
					who is possessed of systematic attention,<br/>
					cultivates and makes much of<br/>
					the seven limbs of wisdom."</p>
