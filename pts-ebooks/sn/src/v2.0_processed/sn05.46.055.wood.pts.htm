					<p class="f4">These seven limbs of wisdom,<br/>

					<p class="f4">At these words Saṇgārava the brahmin said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should lift up the fallen,<br/>
					discover the hidden,<br/>
					point out the way to the bewildered,<br/>
					show a light in the gloom, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now they that have eyes to see<br/>

					<p class="f4">even so in divers ways<br/>

					<p class="f4">I, even I, lord,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Gotama accept me as a disciple,<br/>
