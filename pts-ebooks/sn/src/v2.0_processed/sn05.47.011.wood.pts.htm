					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Sāriputta said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'A superman, a superman,'<br/>
					is the saying, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far is one a superman?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is by emancipation of mind, Sāriputta,<br/>
					that I call a man<br/>
					'superman.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Without emancipation of mind<br/>
					there is no superman, I declare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Sāriputta, is one's mind emancipated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Sāriputta, a monk abides in body contemplating body (as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining that dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he so abides in body contemplating body,<br/>
					his mind is purified,<br/>
					emancipated,<br/>
					by freedom from the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abides in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining that dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he so abides in feelings contemplating feelings,<br/>
					his mind is purified,<br/>
					emancipated,<br/>
					by freedom from the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abides in mind contemplating mind (as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining that dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he so abides in mind contemplating mind,<br/>
					his mind is purified,<br/>
					emancipated,<br/>
					by freedom from the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abides in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining that dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he so abides in mind-states contemplating mind-states,<br/>
					his mind is purified,<br/>
					emancipated,<br/>
					by freedom from the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Sāriputta, is one's mind emancipated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, <span class="f2 g"><b>[138]</b></span> Sāriputta,<br/>
					it is by emancipation of mind<br/>
					that I call a man<br/>
					'superman.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Without this emancipation of mind<br/>
					there is no superman, I declare."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> I borrow this term from <i>Dialog.</i> iii, 134, q v. <i>Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> ii, 35; <i>Dhp.</i> 352. <i>Comy.</i> has no remarks on this <i>sutta.</i> At <i>D. loc. cit.</i> the editors remark: 'These are the only passages in "the sixteen volumes of the <i>Four Nikāyas</i> in which the word has so far been traced. This is sufficient to show that the word (<i>mahāpuriso</i>) is not in use as a technical term in the Buddhist doctrine. It occurs only when the brahmin use of the term is referred to (Sāriputta was a brahmin), and is there used to show the startling contrast between the brahmin and the Buddhist conceptions of what a superman must be.' <i>Cf.</i> also <i>Sn.</i> 1040.</p>
