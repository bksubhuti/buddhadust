					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the venerable Sāriputta was staying <span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span> among the Magadhese<br/>
					at Nālagāmaka,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					being sick,<br/>
					afflicted,<br/>
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Cunda the novice was in attendance<br/>
					on the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it was owing to this sickness<br/>
					that the venerable Sāriputta passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Cunda the novice,<br/>
					taking the venerable Sāriputta's bowl and outer robe,<br/>
					went to Sāvatthī,<br/>
					to Jeta Grove,<br/>
					and so to Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br/>
					where he went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					Cunda the novice said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, the venerable Sāriputta has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are his bowl and outer robe.</p>

					<p class="f4">[This water-strainer holds his relics.]"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Cunda, this piece of news<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					will be an excuse for seeing the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go, friend Cunda,<br/>
					to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and when we get there<br/>
					we will tell him about this matter."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, sir," said Cunda the novice<br/>
					in reply to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					and Cunda the novice<br/>
					went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus sat<br/>
					the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, this Cunda the novice said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, the venerable Sāriputta has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are his bowl and outer robe.</p>

					<p class="f4">This water-strainer holds his relics.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, lord, thereat<br/>
					my body was as if drugged.</p>

					<p class="f4">My bearings were confused.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span> The teachings<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> were not clear to me<br/>
					when I heard the words<br/>
					'the venerable Sāriputta has passed away.'"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But tell me, Ānanda,<br/>
					when the venerable Sāriputta passed away,<br/>
					did he take with him<br/>
					the constituents of virtue;<br/>
					did he take with him<br/>
					the constituents of concentration;<br/>
					did he take with him<br/>
					the constituents of wisdom;<br/>
					did he take with him<br/>
					the constituents of release;<br/>
					did he take with him<br/>
					the constituents of release by knowing and seeing?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, lord, when the venerable Sāriputta passed away<br/>
					he did not take with him the constituents of virtue;<br/>
					he did not take with him<br/>
					the constituents of concentration;<br/>
					he did not take with him<br/>
					the constituents of wisdom;<br/>
					he did not take with him<br/>
					the constituents of release;<br/>
					he did not take with him<br/>
					the constituents of release by knowing and seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he was to me an adviser,<br/>
					one who was well grounded.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He was an instructor,<br/>
					one who could arouse,<br/>
					incite<br/>
					and gladden.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was unwearied in teaching the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was the patron<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a></sup></span><br/>
					of those who lived the righteous life along with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">We bear in mind<br/>
					that essence of the Norm,<br/>
					that patronage of the Norm<br/>
					possessed by the venerable Sāriputta, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have I not aforetime<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a></sup></span><br/>
					declared to you this, Ānanda, - <span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span> how in all things that are dear and delightful<br/>
					there is the nature of diversity,<br/>
					the nature of separation,<br/>
					the nature of otherness?</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it possible, Ānanda,<br/>
					in the case of what is born,<br/>
					what is become,<br/>
					what is compounded,<br/>
					what is transitory, -<br/>
					how is it possible<br/>
					to have one's wish fulfilled:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oh! may it not perish'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, such a thing cannot be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Ānanda, from some mighty tree,<br/>
					standing firm and full of vigour<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a></sup></span><br/>
					one of the greater limbs rots off, -<br/>
					even so, Ānanda, from the mighty Order of monks,<br/>
					standing firm and full of vigour,<br/>
					Sāriputta has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it possible, Ānanda,<br/>
					I say,<br/>
					in the case of what is born,<br/>
					what is become,<br/>
					what is compounded,<br/>
					what is transitory, -<br/>
					how is it possible<br/>
					that one's wish can be fulfilled:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oh! may it not perish'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, such a thing cannot be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda,<br/>
					do ye abide grounded on self,<br/>
					self-refuged,<br/>
					taking refuge in none other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye abide grounded on the Norm,<br/>
					taking refuge in the Norm,<br/>
					having none other refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Ānanda,<br/>
					does a monk so abide?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda,<br/>
					a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Ānanda, is how a monk abides grounded on self,<br/>
					self-refuged,<br/>
					taking refuge in none other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, Ānanda,<br/>
					either now<br/>
					or when I have passed away,<br/>
					shall abide grounded on self,<br/>
					self-refuged,<br/>
					taking refuge in none other;<br/>
					grounded on the Norm,<br/>
					with the Norm for refuge,<br/>
					taking refuge in none other, -<br/>
					they, Ānanda,<br/>
					shall be my monks,<br/>
					they shall be atop of the gloom;<br/>
					that is,<br/>
					they who are anxious to learn."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span></p>
