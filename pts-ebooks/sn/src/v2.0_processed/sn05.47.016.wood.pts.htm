					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Uttiya came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					the venerable Uttiya said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord,<br/>
					if the Exalted One wrould teach me<br/>
					a teaching in brief,<br/>
					hearing which teaching from the Exalted One<br/>
					I might dwell solitary,<br/>
					remote,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and aspiring."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In such case, Uttiya,<br/>
					you must purify the rudiments in good states.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are the rudiments in good states?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is virtue<br/>
					that is truly pure<br/>
					and straight view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Uttiya, when your virtue shall be truly pure<br/>
					and your view straight,<br/>
					thenceforward,<br/>
					leaning on virtue,<br/>
					established in virtue,<br/>
					you can cultivate the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein Uttiya, do you abide in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abide in feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abide in mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abide in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Uttiya, when you,<br/>
					leaning on virtue,<br/>
					established in virtue,<br/>
					shall have thus cultivated<br/>
					the four stations of mindfulness,<br/>
					thenceforward, Uttiya,<br/>
					you shall pass beyond the realm of death."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Uttiya was delighted with the words of the Exalted One<br/>
					and was glad of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he rose up,<br/>
					saluted the Exalted One by the right<br/>
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Uttiya,<br/>
					dwelling solitary and remote,<br/>
					earnest,<br/>
					ardent<br/>
					and aspiring,<br/>
					in no long time<br/>
					attained that goal<br/>
					for which the clansmen rightly leave home<br/>
					for the homeless,<br/>
					even that unrivalled goal of righteous living,<br/>
					attained in even this very life:<br/>
					and, knowing it for himself,<br/>
					realizing it for himself,<br/>
					abode therein,<br/>
					so that he came to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lived is the righteous life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Done is what I had to do.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed there is no more of being here for me."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Uttiya was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
