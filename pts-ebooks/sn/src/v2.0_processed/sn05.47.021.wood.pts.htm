					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Bhadda<br/>
					were staying at Pāṭaliputra<br/>
					in Cock's Pleasaunce.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhadda,<br/>
					rising from his solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously and,<br/>
					after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					the venerable Bhadda said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, friend Ānanda,<br/>
					as to these virtuous habits<br/>
					spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					what is the use of them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said! well said, friend Bhadda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Welcome is your penetration,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					welcome is your ready wit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Goodly is your questioning.</p>

					<p class="f4">You ask this, friend Bhadda,<br/>
					do you not?</p>

					<p class="f4">'As to these virtuous habits<br/>
					spoken of by the Exalted One,<br/>
					what is the use of them?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend Bhadda, the virtuous habits<br/>
					spoken of by the Exalted One<br/>
					are those which come<br/>
					by the cultivation of four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, friend, are the virtuous habits<br/>
					so spoken of by the Exalted One, -<br/>
					those which come<br/>
					by the cultivation of the four stations of mindfulness."</p>
