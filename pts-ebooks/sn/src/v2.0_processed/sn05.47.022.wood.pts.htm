					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Bhadda<br/>
					were staying at Pāṭaliputra<br/>
					in Cock's Pleasaunce.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhadda,<br/>
					rising from his solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously and,<br/>
					after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					the venerable Bhadda said this<br/>
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, friend Ānanda, what is the con- <span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span> dition,<br/>
					what is the cause,<br/>
					why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br/>
					the good Norm does not last long?</p>

					<p class="f4">What again, friend Ānanda, is the condition,<br/>
					what the cause,<br/>
					why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br/>
					the good Norm does last long?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, friend Bhadda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Welcome is your penetration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Welcome is your ready wit.</p>

					<p class="f4">You ask this, do you not?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, friend Ānanda, what is the condition,<br/>
					what is the cause,<br/>
					why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br/>
					the good Norm does not last long?</p>

					<p class="f4">What again, friend Ānanda, is the condition,<br/>
					what the cause,<br/>
					why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br/>
					the good Norm does last long?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, it is owing to not cultivating,<br/>
					not making much of<br/>
					four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, friend, is the reason<br/>
					why the good Norm does not last long.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, it is owing to cultivating<br/>
					and making much of<br/>
					four stations of mindfulness<br/>
					that the good Norm does so last.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is owing to not cultivating,<br/>
					not making much of<br/>
					these four stations of mindfulness<br/>
					that is the reason<br/>
					why the good Norm does not last long.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, it is owing to cultivating<br/>
					and making much of<br/>
					these four stations of mindfulness<br/>
					that the good Norm does last long."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
