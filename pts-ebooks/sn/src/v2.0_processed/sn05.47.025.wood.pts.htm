					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brahmin came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously and,<br/>
					after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the condition, master Gotama,<br/>
					what is the cause,<br/>
					why, after the final passing away of the Tathāgata,<br/>
					the good Norm does not last long;<br/>
					and again, master Gotama,<br/>
					what is the condition,<br/>
					what the cause,<br/>
					why, after the final passing away of the Tathāgata,<br/>
					the good Norm does last long?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is owing to not cultivating, brahmin,<br/>
					owing to not making much of<br/>
					four stations of mindfulness,<br/>
					that the good Norm does not last long<br/>
					after the final passing away of the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is owing to cultivating, brahmin,<br/>
					owing to making much of<br/>
					four stations of mindfulness,<br/>
					that the good Norm lasts long<br/>
					after the final passing away of the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is owing to not cultivating, brahmin,<br/>
					owing to not making much of<br/>
					these four stations of mindfulness,<br/>
					that the good Norm does not last long<br/>
					after the final passing away of the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is owing to cultivating, brahmin,<br/>
					owing to making much of<br/>
					these four stations of mindfulness,<br/>
					that the good Norm lasts long<br/>
					after the final passing away of the Tathāgata."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should lift up the fallen,<br/>
					discover the hidden,<br/>
					point out the way to the bewildered,<br/>
					show a light in the gloom, saying:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now they that have eyes to see<br/>
					can see objects,' -|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">even so in divers ways<br/>
					has the Exalted One expounded the truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, even I, lord,<br/>
					do go for refuge to the Exalted One,<br/>
					to the Norm<br/>
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me as his follower,<br/>
					as one who has taken refuge in him,<br/>
					from this day forth<br/>
					so long as my life shall last."</p>
