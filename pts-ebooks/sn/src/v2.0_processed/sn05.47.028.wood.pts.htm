					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br/>
					and the venerable Anuruddha<br/>
					were staying at Sāketa in Cactus Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					together with Moggallāna the Great,<br/>
					rising from their solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to visit the venerable Anuruddha,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and, after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta said this<br/>
					to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"By cultivating and making much<br/>
					of how many conditions<br/>
					has the venerable Anuruddha<br/>
					come to great superknowledge?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, it is by cultivating and making much<br/>
					of four stations of mindfulness<br/>
					that I have come to great superknowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, friend, it is by cultivating,<br/>
					by making much<br/>
					of these four stations of mindfulness<br/>
					that I have come to understand the universe<br/>
					with its thousand worlds."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
