					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"By whomsoever, monks, the four stations of mindfulness are neglected,<br/>
					by them also is neglected<br/>
					the Ariyan way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">By whomsoever, monks, the four stations of mindfulness are undertaken,<br/>
					by them also is undertaken<br/>
					the Ariyan way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br/>
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These four stations of mindfulness, monks,<br/>
					if cultivated<br/>
					and made much of,<br/>
					conduce to downright revulsion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					to calm,<br/>
					to full comprehension,<br/>
					to perfect wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">"By whomsoever, monks, the four stations of mindfulness are neglected,<br/>
					by them also is neglected<br/>
					the Ariyan way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">By whomsoever, monks, the four stations of mindfulness are undertaken,<br/>
					by them also is undertaken<br/>
					the Ariyan way for the utter destruction of ill."</p>
