					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, monks,<br/>
					a station of mindfulness,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span><br/>
					the cultivation of<br/>
					a station of mindfulness,<br/>
					and the practice leading to the cultivation of<br/>
					a station of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is a station of mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk abides in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a></sup> Woodward's translation of <i>'-paṭṭhāna'</i> as 'stations' breaks down here where the use is put into the singular. Woodward inserts 'The Four' here, but below uses 'a station' which is very awkward when it deals with the four together. I have changed it here to the singlular for internal consistency and consistency with the Pali. Bhk. Bodhi translates 'establishment'. Since <i>'-paṭṭhāna'</i> can also be understood in the sense of 'pasture' (resort or establishment as in residence, or alternatively as basis of nourishment) which would face the same issues, if 'station' or 'pasture' or 'resort' or the like is for some reason preferred, the solution would be to set up the sutta so that the whole sequence was repeated four times, once for each of the 'stations'.</p>
