					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[161]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"On a certain occasion, monks,<br/>
					I was staying at Uruvela,<br/>
					on the bank of the river Nerañjarā,<br/>
					under the Goatherds' Banyan,<br/>
					after I had just attained enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span> Then, monks, as I meditated in solitude,<br/>
					this train of thought arose in my mmd:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the one sole way<br/>
					that leads to the purification of beings,<br/>
					to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br/>
					to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br/>
					to the winning of the Method,<br/>
					to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk should dwell in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the one sole way<br/>
					that leads to the purification of beings,<br/>
					to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br/>
					to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br/>
					to the winning of the Method,<br/>
					to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					the four stations of mindfulness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>
					reading with his mind my mind,<br/>
					just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br/>
					or draw in his outstretched arm, -<br/>
					even so did Brahmā Sahampati vanish from the Brahma World<br/>
					and appear before me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>
					drawing his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/>
					joined his hands<br/>
					and raised them to me<br/>
					and thus spoke:</p>

					<p class="f4">'True it is, O Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">True it is, O Happy One!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the one sole way<br/>
					that leads to the purification of beings,<br/>
					to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br/>
					to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br/>
					to the winning of the Method,<br/>
					to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk should dwell in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>

					to wit:<br/>
					the four stations of mindfulness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake Brahmā Sahampati.</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying he added this further:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Beholding this one way for ending birth,<br/>
							This way the All-compassionate doth know:<br/>
							By this way men ere now have crossed the flood,<br/>
							Shall cross and do cross now.'"</p>
