					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling that is pleasant,<br/>
					feeling that is painful,<br/>
					feeling that is neither pleasant nor painful.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the full understanding of these three feelings<br/>
					the four stations of mindfulness ought to be cultivated.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the full understanding of these three feelings<br/>
					the four stations of mindfulness ought to be cultivated."</p>
