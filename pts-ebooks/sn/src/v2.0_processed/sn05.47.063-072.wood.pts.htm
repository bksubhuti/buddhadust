					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, monks, of all woven cloths whatsoever<br/>
					the cloth of Benares is reckoned chief,<br/>
					even so, monks, of all profitable conditions,<br/>
					which are rooted in earnestness,<br/>
					which join together in earnestness, —<br/>
					of those conditions<br/>
					earnestness is reckoned chief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the earnest monk<br/>
					it may be expected<br/>
					that he will cultivate,<br/>
					that he will make much of<br/>
					the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks,<br/>
					does a monk who is earnest<br/>
					cultivate<br/>
					and make much of<br/>
					the four stations of mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in body in a contemplaton of body<br/>
					based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in feeling in a contemplaton of feeling<br/>
					based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
					on cessation,<br/>
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in mind in a contemplaton of mind<br/>
					based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>

					based on seclusion,<br/>
					on dispassion,<br/>
