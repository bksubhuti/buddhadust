					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br/>
					the controlling power of energy,<br/>
					the controlling power of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling power of concentration,<br/>
					the controlling power of insight.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the controlling power of faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has faith in the wisdom of the Tathāgata, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					supremely Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the controlling power of faith.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the controlling power of energy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					dwells resolute in energy,<br/>
					ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br/>
					to acquire good qualities,<br/>
					strenuously exerting himself,<br/>
					not throwing off the burden in good qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">He starts desire,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					strives,<br/>
					sets going energy,<br/>
					lays hold of thought<br/>
					and exerts effort<br/>
					to prevent the arising of bad qualities not yet arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">He starts desire<br/>
					strives,<br/>
					sets going energy,<br/>
					lays hold of thought<br/>
					and exerts effort<br/>
					to abandon bad qualities <span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span> that have arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">He starts desire<br/>
					strives,<br/>
					sets going energy,<br/>
					lays hold of thought<br/>
					and exerts effort<br/>
					for the persistence of good qualities that have arisen,<br/>
					for their non-confusion,<br/>
					for their more-becoming,<br/>
					for their increase and development,<br/>
					for their perfecting.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					'the controlling power of energy.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the controlling power of mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is mindful,<br/>
					possessed of supreme discrimination,<br/>
					one who calls to mind and remembers<br/>
					things said and done long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in body contemplating body (as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in mind contemplating mind (as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					composed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the controlling power of mindfulness.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the controlling power of concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					making self-surrender the object of his thought,<br/>
					lays hold of concentration,<br/>
					lays hold of one-pointedness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, aloof from sensuality,<br/>
					aloof from evil conditions,<br/>
					enters on the first trance,<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					which is born of solitude,<br/>
					easeful and zestful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					he enters on<br/>
					(that inward calm,<br/>
					that single-minded purpose,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful<br/>
					and full of ease,<br/>
					which is)<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> the second trance,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then (by the fading out of zest<br/>
					he becomes balanced<br/>
					and remains mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences with the body<br/>
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:<br/>
					The balanced thoughtful man<br/>
					dwells happily; and)<br/>
					he enters on the third trance<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain,<br/>
					by the coming to an end<br/>
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br/>
					he enters on<br/>
					and abides in<br/>
					the fourth trance,<br/>
					which is free of pain<br/>
					and free of pleasure,<br/>
					a state of perfect purity of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br/>
					'the controlling power of concentration.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span> And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					is the controlling power of insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					is possessed of insight thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He has insight<br/>
					for tracing out the rise and fall of things,<br/>
					insight which is Ariyan,<br/>
					penetrating,<br/>
					going on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands, as it really is,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands, as it really is,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands, as it really is,</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice<br/>
					that goes to the cessation of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					'the controlling power of insight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, are the five controlling powers."</p>
