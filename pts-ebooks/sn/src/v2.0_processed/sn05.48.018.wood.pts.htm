					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br/>
					the controlling power of energy,<br/>
					the controlling power of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling power of concentration,<br/>
					the controlling power of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the five controlling powers.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">By the completion and fulfilment, monks,<br/>
					of these five controlling powers<br/>
					one is Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one have them in a less degree,<br/>
					he is practising to realize the fruits of Arahantship.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree<br/>
					one is a non-returner.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/>
					he is a once-returner.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/>
					he is a stream-winner.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/>
					he is a Norm-follower.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br/>
					he is 'one who walks by faith.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, he in whom these five controlling powers<br/>
					are in every way,<br/>
					everywhere,<br/>
					wholly and utterly absent,<br/>
					of such an one I say<br/>
					'he is an outsider,<br/>
					one who stands in the ranks of the many-folk.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>
