					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six sense-faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">The sense-faculty of eye,<br/>
					the sense-faculty of ear,<br/>
					the sense-faculty of nose,<br/>
					the sense-faculty of tongue,<br/>
					the sense-faculty of body<br/>
					the sense-faculty of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the six sense faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					the arising<br/>
					and the perishing of,<br/>
					the satisfaction in,<br/>
					the misery of,<br/>

					these six faculties of sense,<br/>
					such are not worthy to be accounted<br/>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, those recluses and brahmins who do understand,<br/>
