					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of ease,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of discomfort,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of happiness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five controlling faculties.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when a monk, by understanding,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					the arising<br/>
					and the perishing of,<br/>
					the satisfaction in,<br/>
					the misery of<br/>
					and the escape from<br/>
					these five controlling faculties,<br/>
					is freed without grasping,<br/>
					such an Ariyan disciple is called<br/>
					'Arahant,<br/>
					one in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br/>
					one who has lived the life,<br/>
					done his task,<br/>
					lifted the burden,<br/>
					a winner of his own welfare,<br/>
					who has outworn the fetters of rebirth,<br/>
					one who is released by perfect insight.'"</p>
