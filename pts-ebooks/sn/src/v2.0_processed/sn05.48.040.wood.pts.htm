					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of discomfort,<br/>
					the the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br/>
					controlling faculty of ease,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of happiness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five controlling faculties.</p>
