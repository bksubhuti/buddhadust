					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in East Park,<br/>
					at the terraced house of Migara's mother.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One,<br/>
					having arisen from his solitude at eventide,<br/>
					was seated warming his back<br/>
					in the westering sunshine.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and, while chafing his limbs<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> with his hand,<br/>
					said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a strange thing, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a wonder, lord,<br/>
					how the skin of the Exalted One<br/>
					is no longer clear and translucent,<br/>
					and how all his limbs are slack<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					and <span class="f2 g"><b>[192]</b></span> wrinkled,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					his body bent forward,<br/>
					and a change is to be seen<br/>
					in his sense-faculties of eye,<br/>
					ear,<br/>
					nose,<br/>
					tongue<br/>
					and body!"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Old age is by nature inherent in youth,<br/>
					sickness in health,<br/>
					and death in life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is<br/>
					that my skin is no longer clear and translucent as of yore;<br/>
					my limbs are slack and wrinkled,<br/>
					my body stoops forward<br/>
					and a change is to be noticed<br/>
					in my sense-faculties of eye,<br/>
					ear,<br/>
					nose,<br/>
					tongue<br/>
					and body."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Having so said, the Happy One as Teacher added this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Shame on thee,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span> miserable age!<br/>
							Age that maketh colour fade!<br/>
							The pleasing image<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span> of a man<br/>
							By age is trampled down.<br/>
							Tho' one should live a hundred years,<br/>
							Natheless he is consigned to death.<br/>
							Death passeth nothing by,<br/>
							But trampleth everything.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <i>Comy.</i> discusses the question as to how the sunshine can pierce through the <i>Buddha-teja</i> or <i>aura,</i> and concludes that it cannot do so. 'Then what is warmed? The radiance itself is warmed. Just as when one sits under a spreading tree, the sunshine does not touch the body, but the radiance of it spreads all round, and it is like being surrounded by a flame of fire. So we are to understand thus: The Master was sitting warming his aura (?).</p>
