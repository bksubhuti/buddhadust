					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāketa<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					at Añjana Wood,<br/>
					in Antelope Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One said this to the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, is there any method,<br/>
					by reckoning according to which<br/>
					the five controlling faculties<br/>
					are the five powers,<br/>
					and the five powers again<br/>
					are the five controlling faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br/>
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br/>
					their guide,<br/>
					their resort.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It were well for us<br/>
					if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br/>
					of what he has just uttered."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, monks, there is such a method,<br/>
					by reckoning according to which<br/>
					the five controlling faculties<br/>
					are the five powers,<br/>
					and again the five powers<br/>
					are the five controlling faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is such a method,<br/>
					by reckoning according to which<br/>
					the five controlling faculties<br/>
					are the five powers,<br/>
					and again the five powers<br/>
					are the five controlling faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, which is the controlling faculty of faith<br/>
					is also the power of faith:<br/>
					that which is the power of faith<br/>
					is also the controlling faculty of faith.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, which is the controlling faculty of energy<br/>
					is also the power of energy:<br/>
					that which is the power of energy<br/>
					is also the controlling faculty of energy.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, which is the controlling faculty of mindfulness<br/>
					is also the power of mindfulness:<br/>
					that which is the power of mindfulness<br/>
					is also the controlling faculty of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, which is the controlling faculty of concentration<br/>
					is also the power of concentration:<br/>
					that which is the power of concentration<br/>
					is also the controlling faculty of concentration.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[195]</b></span> That, monks, which is the controlling faculty of insight<br/>
					is also the power of insight:<br/>
					that which is the power of insight<br/>
					is also the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, a river that flows east,<br/>
					slopes east,<br/>
					tends east.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the middle of it is an island.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, there is a method,<br/>
					by reckoning according to which,<br/>
					the stream of that river is accounted single.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again there is a method,<br/>
					by reckoning according to which,<br/>
					the stream is accounted double.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what sort of method is that<br/>
					according to which the stream of that river<br/>
					may be reckoned as single?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">The water at the east end<br/>
					and the water at the west end<br/>
					of that island<br/>
					will be reckoned as a single stream.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the method.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what sort of method<br/>
					is that according to which<br/>
					the stream of that river<br/>
					may be reckoned as double?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">The water on the north side<br/>
					and the water on the south side<br/>
					will be reckoned as a double stream.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the method<br/>
					according to which the stream<br/>
					may be reckoned as double.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br/>
					that which is the controlling faculty of faith<br/>
					is also the power of faith:<br/>
					that which is the power of faith<br/>
					is also the controlling faculty of faith;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is the controlling faculty of energy<br/>
					is also the power of energy:<br/>
					that which is the power of energy<br/>
					is also the controlling faculty of energy;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is the controlling faculty of mindfulness<br/>
					is also the power of mindfulness:<br/>
					that which is the power of mindfulness<br/>
					is also the controlling faculty of mindfulness;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is the controlling faculty of concentration<br/>
					is also the power of concentration:<br/>
					that which is the power of concentration<br/>
					is also the controlling faculty of concentration;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is the controlling faculty of insight<br/>
					is also the power of insight:<br/>
					that which is the power of insight<br/>
					is also the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, by the fact of cultivating and making much of<br/>
					the five controlling faculties,<br/>
					a monk, by the destruction of the <i>āsavas,</i><br/>
					in this very life<br/>
					fully comprehends,<br/>
					realizes for himself<br/>
					and attains intellectual release<br/>
					and release by insight,<br/>
					and abides therein."</p>
