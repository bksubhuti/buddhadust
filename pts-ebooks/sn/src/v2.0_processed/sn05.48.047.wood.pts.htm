					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in East Park,<br/>
					at the terraced house of Migara's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, by cultivating and making much<br/>
					of what controlling faculties<br/>
					does the monk in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br/>
					declare gnosis,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br/>
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					there is no more of being here for me'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br/>
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br/>
					their guide,<br/>
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well for us<br/>
					if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br/>
					of what he has just uttered."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, monks, by cultivating and making much<br/>
					of four<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> controlling faculties,<br/>
					a man in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br/>
					may thus declare gnosis:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br/>
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					there is no more of being here for me.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are those four controlling faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of energy,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by cultivating and making much of these four controlling faculties,<br/>
					a man in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br/>
					may thus declare gnosis:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br/>
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					there is no more of being here for me.'"</p>
