					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī<br/>
					in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Bhāradvājan,<br/>
					the venerable Scrap-hunter,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> so called,<br/>
					had declared gnosis,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I know full well<br/>
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					there is no more of being here for me."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of monks<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> came to visit the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br/>
					those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the Bhāradvājan,<br/>
					the venerable Scrap-hunter,<br/>
					had declared gnosis,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br/>
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, in consequence of what observation<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					did the Bhāradvājan,<br/>
					the venerable Scrap-hunter,<br/>
					thus declare gnosis,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br/>
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					there is no more of being here for me.'?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, it was in consequence of having cultivated<br/>
					and made much of<br/>
					three controlling faculties<br/>
					that the Bhārad- <span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span> vājan,<br/>
					the venerable Scrap-hunter,<br/>
					thus declared gnosis,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br/>
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of insight.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It was in consequence of having cultivated<br/>
					and made much of<br/>
					these three controlling faculties<br/>
					that gnosis was declared by the Bhāradvājan, the venerable Scrap-hunter,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br/>
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now these three controlling faculties, -<br/>
					what do they end in?</p>

					<p class="f4">They end in destruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">They end in destruction of what?</p>

					<p class="f4">They end in the destruction of rebirth,<br/>
					old age<br/>
					and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it was because he saw full well<br/>
					that rebirth was destroyed,<br/>
					that old age was destroyed,<br/>
					that death was destroyed,<br/>
					that the Bhāradvājan, the venerable Scrap-hunter,<br/>
					was able to declare gnosis,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br/>
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br/>
					lived is the holy life,<br/>
					done is the task,<br/>
					there is no more of being here for me.'"</p>
