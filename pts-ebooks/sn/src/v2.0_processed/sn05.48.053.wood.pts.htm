					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī<br/>
					in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tell me, monks,<br/>
					is there any method<br/>
					by proceeding according to which<br/>
					a monk who is a learner,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					standing at the level of a learner,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or a monk who is an adept,<br/>
					standing at the level of an adept,<br/>
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an adept'?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br/>
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br/>
					their guide,<br/>
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well for us<br/>
					if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br/>
					of what he has just uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br/>
					the brethren will remember it."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, monks, there is such a method<br/>
					by proceeding according to which<br/>
					a monk who is a learner,<br/>
					standing at the level of a learner,<br/>
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and a monk who is an adept,<br/>
					standing at the level of an adept,<br/>
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an adept.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort is that method, monks?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk who is a learner<br/>
					knows full well</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is <span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span> Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows full well</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows full well</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows full well</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice leading to the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the method<br/>
					by proceeding according to which<br/>
					a monk who is a learner,<br/>
					standing at the level of a learner,<br/>
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, a monk who is a learner<br/>
					thus ponders:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there, I wonder,<br/>
					outside<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> (this Order of monks)<br/>
					anyone,<br/>
					whether recluse or brahmin,<br/>
					who can teach a doctrine<br/>
					that is natural,<br/>
					true<br/>
					and proper,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					such as the Exalted One teaches?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he concludes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no one<br/>
					outside (this Order of monks)<br/>
					whether recluse or brahmin,<br/>
					who can teach a doctrine<br/>
					that is natural,<br/>
					true<br/>
					and proper,<br/>
					such as the Exalted One teaches.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the method<br/>
					by proceeding according to which<br/>
					a monk who is a learner,<br/>
					standing at the level of a learner,<br/>
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br/>
					the monk who is a learner<br/>
					is fully aware of the five controlling faculties:</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as to what is their destiny,<br/>
					what their excellence,<br/>
					what their fruits<br/>
					and final goal,<br/>
					he dwells not in personal experience<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span> thereof,<br/>
					nor does he pierce through and through by insigbt<br/>
					and see them plain.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the method<br/>
					by proceeding according to which<br/>
					a monk who is a learner,<br/>
					standing at the level of a learner,<br/>
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the method<br/>
					according to which the adept monk<br/>
					standing at the level of an adept<br/>
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an adept'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein the adept monk<br/>
					fully understands the five controlling faculties:</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>
					the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise as to what is their destiny,<br/>
					what their excellence,<br/>
					their fruits<br/>
					and final goal,<br/>
					he dwells in personal experience thereof:<br/>
					he pierces them through and through and sees them plain.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is the method by which an adept monk<br/>
					standing at the level of an adept<br/>
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an adept.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span> Then again, a monk who is an adept<br/>
					fully understands the six sense-faculties,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">The sense-facuity of eye,<br/>
					the sense-facuity of ear,<br/>
					the sense-facuity of nose,<br/>
					the sense-facuity of tongue,<br/>
					the sense-facuity of body<br/>
					the sense-facuity of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These six sense-faculties<br/>
					must come to cease without remainder,<br/>
					utterly,<br/>
					altogether,<br/>
					in every way<br/>
					and everywhere:<br/>
					nor shall other six sense-faculties arise<br/>
					anywhere<br/>
					or anyhow.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He knows that full well.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks is the method by which an adept monk<br/>
					standing at the level of an adept<br/>
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an adept.'</p>
