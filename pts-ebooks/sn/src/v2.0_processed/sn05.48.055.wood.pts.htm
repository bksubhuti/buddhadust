					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī<br/>
					in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, monks, of all scented heart-woods whatsoever<br/>
					the red sandalwood is reckoned chief,<br/>
					even so, monks,<br/>
					of all the principles whatsoever<br/>
					that are on the side of the wisdom,<br/>
					the <span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span> controlling faculty of insight is reckoned chief,<br/>
					that is, for attaining the wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br/>
					are the principles<br/>
					that are on the side of the wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith, monks,<br/>
					is a principle that is on the side of the wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to attaining the wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of mindfulness, monks,<br/>
					is a principle that is on the side of the wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to attaining the wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of concentration,<br/>
					is a principle that is on the side of the wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to attaining the wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of insight,<br/>
					is a principle that is on the side of the wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to attaining the wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, monks, of all scented heart-woods whatsoever<br/>
					the red sandalwood is reckoned chief,<br/>
					even so, monks,<br/>
					of all the principles whatsoever<br/>
