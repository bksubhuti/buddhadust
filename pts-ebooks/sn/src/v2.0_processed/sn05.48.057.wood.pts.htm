					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard: On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Uruvelā,<br/>
					on the bank of the river Nerañjarā,<br/>
					under the Goatherds' Banyan,<br/>
					just after his attainment of perfect enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span> Now in the Exalted One, when he had retired to his solitary communing,<br/>
					there arose this mental reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are five controlling faculties which,<br/>
					cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunge into the Deathless,<br/>
					have their end and goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunges into the Deathless,<br/>
					has its end in the Deathless,<br/>
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of energy<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunges into the Deathless,<br/>
					has its end in the Deathless,<br/>
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of mindfulness<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunges into the Deathless,<br/>
					has its end in the Deathless,<br/>
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of concentration<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunges into the Deathless,<br/>
					has its end in the Deathless,<br/>
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of insight<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunges into the Deathless,<br/>
					has its end in the Deathless,<br/>
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">These five,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunge into the Deathless,<br/>
					have their end and goal in the Deathless."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>
					reading with his mind<br/>
					the mental reflection of the Exalted One, -<br/>
					just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm<br/>
					or bend his outstretched arm, -<br/>
					even so did Brahmā Sahampati vanish from the Brahma World<br/>
					and appear before the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then did Brahmā Sahampati,<br/>
					throwing his outer robe over one shoulder,<br/>
					stretch out his folded palms towards the Exalted One<br/>
					and thus address him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, O Happy One!</p>

					<p class="f4">These five controlling faculties,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunge into the Deathless,<br/>
					have their end in the Deathless,<br/>
					have their goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunges into the Deathless,<br/>
					has its end in the Deathless,<br/>
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of energy<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunges into the Deathless,<br/>
					has its end in the Deathless,<br/>
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of mindfulness<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunges into the Deathless,<br/>
					has its end in the Deathless,<br/>
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of concentration<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunges into the Deathless,<br/>
					has its end in the Deathless,<br/>
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of insight<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunges into the Deathless,<br/>
					has its end in the Deathless,<br/>
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">These five,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					plunge into the Deathless,<br/>
					have their end and goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, sir,<br/>
					when Kassapa was the supremely Enlightened One,<br/>
					I was practising the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Men knew me then as Sahaka the monk.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then it was, sir, that by cultivating and making much of<br/>
					these five controlling faculties,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					and by restraining<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> sensual lust in things of sense,<br/>
					on the breaking up of body,<br/>
					I was reborn in the Happy World after death,<br/>
					in the Brahma-World.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereafter men knew me as Brahma Sahampati,<br/>
					Brahma Sahampati!</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, O Happy One!</p>

					<p class="f4">I know it!</p>

					<p class="f4">I see it, - that these five controlling faculties,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					do plunge into the Deathless,<br/>
					do end and have their goal in the Deathless."</p>
