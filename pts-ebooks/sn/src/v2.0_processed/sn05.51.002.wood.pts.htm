					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"By whomsoever, monks,<br/>
					the four bases of psychic power are neglected,<br/>
					by them also is neglected<br/>
					the Ariyan way that goes on<br/>
					to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">By whomsoever, monks,<br/>
					the four bases of psychic power are undertaken,<br/>
					by them also is undertaken<br/>
					the Ariyan way that goes on<br/>
					to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates<br/>
					that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					desire,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates<br/>
					that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					energy,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates<br/>
					that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					thought,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates<br/>
					that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					investigation,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, by whomsoever<br/>
					these four bases of psychic power are neglected,<br/>
					by them also is neglected<br/>
					the Ariyan way that goes on<br/>
					to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">By whomsoever, monks,<br/>
