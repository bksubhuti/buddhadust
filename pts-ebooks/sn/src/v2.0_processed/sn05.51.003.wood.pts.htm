					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four bases of psychic power,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					go hence as the Ariyan hence-goers.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him that acts in accordance therewith<br/>
					they conduce to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					desire,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					energy,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					thought,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					investigation,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these four bases of psychic power,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					go hence as the Ariyan hence-goers.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him that acts in accordance therewith<br/>
					they conduce to the utter destruction of ill."</p>
