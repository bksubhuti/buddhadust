					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whosoever in time past,<br/>
					whether recluses or brahmins,<br/>
					have successfully practised psychic power<br/>
					to a perfect degree,<br/>
					all such have done so<br/>
					by cultivating and making much of<br/>
					the four bases of psychic power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever in future time,<br/>
					whether recluses or brahmins,<br/>
					shall successfully practise psychic power<br/>
					to a perfect degree,<br/>
					all such shall do so<br/>
					by cultivating and making much of<br/>
					the four bases of psychic power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever in the present time,<br/>
					whether recluses or brahmins,<br/>
					do successfully practise psychic power<br/>
					to a perfect degree,<br/>
					all such do so<br/>
					by cultivating and making much of<br/>
					the four bases of psychic power.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					desire,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					energy,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					thought,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					investigation,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whosoever in time past,<br/>
