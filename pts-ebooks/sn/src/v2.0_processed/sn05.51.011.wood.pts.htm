					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Formerly, monks, when I was unenlightened,<br/>

					this occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, I wonder, is the cause,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, it occurred to me thus:</p>
