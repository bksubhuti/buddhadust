					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, it is by cultivating<br/>
					and making much of<br/>
					four bases of psychic power<br/>
					that a monk,<br/>
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas,</i><br/>
					realizes even in this very life<br/>
					by his own unaided powers<br/>
					the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight<br/>
					which is free from the <i>āsavas,</i><br/>
					and having won it<br/>
					dwells therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					desire,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>
