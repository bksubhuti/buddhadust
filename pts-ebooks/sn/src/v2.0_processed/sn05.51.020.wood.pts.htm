					<p class="f4">Thus cultivated, monks,<br/>
					thus made much of,<br/>
					the four bases of psychic power<br/>
					are of great fruit,<br/>
					of great profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by means of the four bases of psychic power,<br/>
					thus cultivated<br/>
					and thus made much of,<br/>
					that a monk enjoys<br/>
					in divers ways<br/>
					manifold farms of magic power,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br/>
					from being many he becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest or invisible<br/>
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br/>
					through a rampart,<br/>
					through a mountain,<br/>
					as if it were through air.</p>

					<p class="f4">He plunges into the earth<br/>
					and shoots up again<br/>
					as if in water.</p>

					<p class="f4">He walks upon the water<br/>
					without parting it,<br/>
					as if on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He travels sitting cross-legged through the air,<br/>
					like a bird upon the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even this moon and sun,<br/>
					though they be of such mighty power and majesty,<br/>
					he handles and strokes them with his hand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as far as the Brahma World<br/>
					he has power with his body.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk has thus cultivated,<br/>
					thus made much of,<br/>
					the four bases of psychic power,<br/>
					with deva-power of hearing,<br/>
					purified and surpassing that of man,<br/>
					he hears sounds<br/>
					both of devas and of humans,<br/>
					whether far or near.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk has thus cultivated,<br/>
					thus made much of,<br/>
					the four bases of psychic power,<br/>
					he knows the minds of other beings,<br/>
					of other persons,<br/>
					with his own mind grasping them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is lustful<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk has thus cultivated,<br/>
					thus made much of,<br/>
					the four bases of psychic power,<br/>
					he calls to mind his former births in divers ways thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br/>
					two births,<br/>
					three births,<br/>
					four births,<br/>
					five births,<br/>
					even ten births,<br/>
					twenty births,<br/>
					thirty births,<br/>
					forty births,<br/>
					fifty births;<br/>
					even a hundred births,<br/>
					a thousand births,<br/>
					a hundred thousand births.</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls to mind divers aeons of involution<br/>
					divers aeons of evolution,<br/>
					diverse aeons of involution and evolution.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such was I by name,<br/>
					such was I by clan,<br/>
					by caste.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus was I nourished,<br/>
					thus did I undergo pleasure and pain,<br/>
					such was my span of life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thence I deceased<br/>
					and rose up so and so.</p>

					<p class="f4">There I dwelt,<br/>
					of such and such a name,<br/>
					of such a clan,<br/>
					of such a caste,<br/>
					so nourished;<br/>
					such and such pleasure and pain did I undergo,<br/>
					such my span of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thence deceased<br/>
					I rose up in the present life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how<br/>
					in fact and detail<br/>
					he calls to mind in divers ways<br/>
					his former births.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk has thus cultivated,<br/>
					thus made much of,<br/>
					the four bases of psychic power,<br/>
					with the deva-sight,<br/>
					purified and surpassing that of man,<br/>
					he beholds beings:<br/>
					as they decease and rise up (elsewhere)<br/>
					he knows them,<br/>
					both mean and exalted,<br/>
					of features fair and foul,<br/>
					gone to weal<br/>
					or gone to woe,<br/>
					according to their deeds, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas! these good folk,<br/>
					given to the practice of evil deeds,<br/>
					of evil words,<br/>
					of evil thoughts,<br/>
					scoffing at the noble ones,<br/>
					of perverted views<br/>
					and reaping the fruit of their perverted views, -<br/>
					these folk,<br/>
					on the dissolution of body,<br/>
					after death arose again in the Waste,<br/>
					the Downfall<br/>
					and the Constant Round.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ah! and these good folk,<br/>
					given to the practice of good deeds,<br/>
					of good words,<br/>
					of good thoughts,<br/>
					not scoffing at the noble ones,<br/>
					of sound views<br/>
					and reaping the fruits of their sound views, -<br/>
					these beings,<br/>
					on the dissolution of body,<br/>
					after death arose again in the Happy Way,<br/>
					the Heaven World.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with deva-sight,<br/>
					purified and surpassing that of man,<br/>
					does he behold beings<br/>
					as they decease and rise up (elsewhere):<br/>
					he knows them,<br/>
					both mean and exalted,<br/>
					of features fair and foul,<br/>
					gone to weal<br/>
					or gone to woe<br/>
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, it is by cultivating<br/>
					and making much of<br/>
					these four bases of psychic power<br/>
					tha a monk,<br/>
					by the destruction of the āsavas,<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					by his own unaided powers<br/>
					attains the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					that is free from the āsavas,<br/>
					realizes it<br/>
					and dwells therein."</p>
