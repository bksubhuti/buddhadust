					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four bases of psychic power.</p>

					<p class="f4">WTiat four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which <span class="f2 g"><b>[254]</b></span> the features are<br/>
					desire,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					energy,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					thought,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					investigation,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four bases of psychic power.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by cultivating<br/>
					and making much of<br/>
					these four bases of psychic power<br/>
					that a monk, by destroying the <i>āsavas,</i><br/>
					even in this very life,<br/>
					realizes by his own unaided power<br/>
					the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					dwells therein."</p>
