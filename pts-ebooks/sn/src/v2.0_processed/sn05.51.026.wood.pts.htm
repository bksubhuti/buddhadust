					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four bases of psychic power.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					desire,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					energy,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					thought,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br/>
					of which the features are<br/>
					investigation,<br/>
					together with the co-factors<br/>
					of concentration<br/>
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four bases of psychic power.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by cultivating<br/>
					and making much of<br/>
					these four bases of psychic power<br/>
					that seven fruits,<br/>
					seven profits may be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this very life, previously,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					he establishes realization:<br/>
					and if he do not so beforehand,<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					at any rate he establishes realization at the time of his death.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And if in this very life, beforehand,<br/>
					he do not establish realization,<br/>
					nor do so at the time of death,<br/>
					then, through having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/>
					he wins release midway.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					nor yet at the time of death,<br/>
					and if he, by wearing down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/>
					win not release midway, -<br/>
					then at any rate,<br/>
					after having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/>
					he wins release by reduction of his (allotted) time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br/>

					at any rate, by having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/>
					he wins release without much trouble.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					nor yet at the time of death,<br/>
					and if he, by wearing down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/>
					win not release midway, -<br/>

					nor wins release with some trouble,<br/>
					at any rate, by having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/>
					then he is 'one who goes upstream,'<br/>
