					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, monks, the river Ganges, Yamunā, Acīravatī, Sarabhū, Mahī<br/>
					flows to the Ocean,<br/>
					slides to the Ocean,<br/>
