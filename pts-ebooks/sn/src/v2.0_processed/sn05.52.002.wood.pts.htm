					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the venerable Anuruddha was meditating in solitude<br/>
					this train of thought occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whosoever neglect the four arisings of mindfulness,<br/>
					by them also is neglected<br/>
					the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever undertake the four arisings of mindfulness,<br/>
					by them also is undertaken<br/>
					the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/>
					reading with his mind<br/>
					the train of thought<br/>
					in the mind of the venerable Anuruddha, -<br/>
					just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br/>
					or draw in his outstretched arm, -<br/>
					even so did he appear before the venerable Anuruddha<br/>
					and said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Anuruddha, to what extent<br/>
					are the four arisings of mindfulness undertaken?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span></p>
