					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Anuruddha<br/>
					was staying on the bank of the river Sutanu<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					at Sāvatthī</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span> Now a number of monks came to visit the venerable Anuruddha,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously and,<br/>
					after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated those monks said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"By cultivating<br/>
					and making much of what conditions<br/>
					has the venerable Anuruddha<br/>
					attained great supernormal power?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, it is by cultivating<br/>
					and making much of<br/>
					four arisings of mindfulness<br/>
					that I have done so.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friends, I dwell in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also, friends, I dwell in feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">I dwell in mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">I dwell in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by cultivating<br/>
					and making much of<br/>
					these four arisings of mindfulness, friends,<br/>
					that I have come by great supernormal power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, friends, by cultivating<br/>
					and making much of<br/>
					these four arisings of mindfulness,<br/>
					I can recognize a mean state as mean,<br/>
					a middling state as middling,<br/>
					and an excellent state as excellent."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>
