					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					in Dark Wood,<br/>
					being sick and grievously afflicted.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a number of monks came to visit the venerable Anuruddha,<br/>
					and on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side thy said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray what is the venerable Anuruddha's life,<br/>
					in that the painful feelings that come upon him<br/>
					make no impression on his mind?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, it is because I dwell<br/>
					with my mind well grounded<br/>
					in four arisings of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the painful feelings that come upon me<br/>
					make no impression on my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friends, I dwell in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also, friends, I dwell in feelings contemplating feelings<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">I dwell in mind contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">I dwell in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I thus dwell, friends,<br/>
					that the painful feelings that come upon me<br/>
					make no impression on my mind."</p>
