					aloof from evil states,<br/>
					enters on the first trance<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					born of solitude,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>

					that one-pointedness of mind,<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second trance,<br/>
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br/>
					he abides indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and composed,<br/>
					and experiences ease through the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having entered on the third trance,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'He who is indifferent and mindful dwells happily,' -<br/>
					he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the abandoning of ease,<br/>
					by the abandoning of discomfort,<br/>
					by the ending of the happiness and unhappiness that he had before,<br/>
					entering on that state which is neither pleasant nor painful,<br/>
					that utter purity of mindfulness reached by indifference,<br/>
					which is the fourth trance,<br/>
