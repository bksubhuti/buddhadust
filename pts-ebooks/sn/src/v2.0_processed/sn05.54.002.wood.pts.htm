					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, concentration on in-breathing and our-breathing,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					is of great fruit,<br/>
					of great profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">How cultivated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Under this rule,<br/>
					a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness<br/>
					accompanied by concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/>
					which tends to seclusion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is Norm-investigation,<br/>
					accompanied by concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/>
					which tends to seclusion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br/>
					which tends to seclusion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br/>
					which tends to seclusion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br/>
					which tends to seclusion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br/>
					which tends to seclusion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity,<br/>
					which tends to seclusion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">If thus cultivated and made much of, monks,<br/>
					the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					is of great fruit,<br/>
					of great profit."</p>
