					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, concentration on in-breathing and our-breathing,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					is of great fruit,<br/>
					of great profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">How cultivated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, under this rule,<br/>
					a monk who goes to a forest<br/>
					or the foot of a tree<br/>
					or a lonely place,<br/>
					sits down cross-legged,<br/>
					holding the body straight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Setting mindfulness in front of him,<br/>
					he breathes in mindfully<br/>
					and mindfully breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a long breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a short breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in,<br/>
					feeling it go through the whole body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling it go through the whole body<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/>
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aware of all mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of all mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus cultivated, monks,<br/>
					thus made much of,<br/>
					the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					is of great fruit,<br/>
					of great profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					be thus cultivated,<br/>
					thus made much of,<br/>
					these seven fruits may be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this very life, previously,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a></sup></span><br/>
					one establishes gnosis,<br/>
					and if not in this same life, previously,<br/>
					then one does so at the moment of death.</p>

					<p class="f4">If not at the moment of death,<br/>
					then, by having worn down the five fetters<br/>
					of the lower sort,<br/>
					he is one who wins release midway.</p>

					<p class="f4">Failing that,<br/>
					he does so by reduction of his time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Failing that he passes away without much trouble</p>

					<p class="f4">Or failing that he passes away with some trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he do none of these,<br/>
					he is 'one who goes upstream,'<br/>
					and he is reborn in the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the seven fruits,<br/>
					the seven profits<br/>
					to be looked for<br/>
					if concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					be cultivated and made much of."</p>
