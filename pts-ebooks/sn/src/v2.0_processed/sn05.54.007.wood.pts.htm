					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					the venerable Kappina the Great<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a></sup></span> was not far off,<br/>
					sitting cross-legged,<br/>
					holding his body erect,<br/>
					with mindfulness set in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One saw the venerable Kappina<br/>
					sitting not far off,<br/>
					sitting cross-legged,<br/>
					holding his body erect,<br/>
					with mindfulness set in front of him<br/>
					and on seeing him he said to the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, do ye ever see any wavering<br/>
					or shaking of body<br/>
					in this monk?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, so far as we have seen him,<br/>
					whether sitting amid the Order<br/>
					or sitting alone and solitary,<br/>
					we have never observed any wavering<br/>
					or shaking of body<br/>
					in that venerable one."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[280]</b></span> "Monks, it is by the fact<br/>
					of cultivating and making much<br/>
					of such concentration<br/>
					that there is no wavering<br/>
					or shaking of body<br/>
					that this monk can attain at will<br/>
					such concentration,<br/>
					can attain it without difficulty,<br/>
					attain it without trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">And by cultivating and making much<br/>
					of what sort of concentration<br/>
					is there no wavering<br/>
					and shaking of body?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by cultivating<br/>
					and making much of<br/>
					the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					that there no wavering<br/>
					and shaking of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how cultivated,<br/>
					how made much of<br/>
					that there no wavering<br/>
					and shaking of body?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this method, monks,<br/>
					a monk who has gone to a forest<br/>
					or the foot of a tree<br/>
					or a lonely place,<br/>
					sits down cross-legged,<br/>
					holding the body straight.<br/>
					Setting mindfulness in front of him,<br/>
					he breathes in mindfully<br/>
					and mindfully breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a long breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a short breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in,<br/>
					feeling it go through the whole body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling it go through the whole body<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/>
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aware of all mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of all mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how,<br/>
					when one cultivates and makes much of<br/>
					the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/>
					there is no wavering or shaking of body,<br/>
					no wavering or shaking of mind."</p>

At [an 1.231], the Master points him out as foremost in preaching, and as 'radiant [<i>odātaka</i> (?). This may mean "of light complexion"; for, as he was a monk, it cannot have its usual meaning "dressed in white"], lean and high-nosed.'<br/>
