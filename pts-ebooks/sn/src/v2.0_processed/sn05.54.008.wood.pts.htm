					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					is of great fruit,<br/>
					of great profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how cultivated and made much of<br/>
					is it of great fruit and great profit?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this method, a monk<br/>
					having gotten himself off to the forest<br/>
					or the foot of a tree<br/>
					or a lonely place,<br/>
					sits down cross-legged,<br/>
					holding the body straight.<br/>
					Setting mindfulness in front of him,<br/>
					he breathes in mindfully<br/>
					and mindfully breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a long breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a short breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in,<br/>
					feeling it go through the whole body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling it go through the whole body<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/>
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aware of all mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of all mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus cultivated, monks,<br/>
					thus made much of,<br/>
					the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					is of great fruit,<br/>
					of great profit."</p>

					<p class="f4">Formerly, monks, before I myself was enlightened with the perfect wisdom,<br/>
					and was yet a Bodhisattva,<br/>
					I used generally to spend my time in this way of living.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I generally lived <span class="f2 g"><b>[281]</b></span> in this way,<br/>
					neither my body nor my eyes were fatigued,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a></sup></span><br/>
					and my mind was freed from the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, if a monk should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May neither my body nor my eyes be fatigued,<br/>
					and by not clinging<br/>
					may my mind be freed from the āsavas', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, if a monk should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever memories and plans I have,<br/>
					attached to the worldly life,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a></sup></span><br/>
					may they be abandoned', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, if a monk should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I dwell conscious of repugnance<br/>
					for what is not repugnant' —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, if a monk should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I dwell unconscious of repugnance for what is repugnant' —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, if a monk should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I dwell conscious of repugnance<br/>
					both for what is not repugnant and for what is' —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, if a monk should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Both for what is repugnant and what is not,<br/>
					may I dwell unconscious of repugnance', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rejecting alike what is non-repugnant and what is repugnant,<br/>
					may I dwell indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and composed', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aloof from sensuality,<br/>
					aloof from evil conditions,<br/>
					having entered on the first trance,<br/>
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of seclusion,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					may I abide therein' , —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'By the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					entering on that inward calm,<br/>
					that onepointedness of mind<br/>
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br/>
					that is born of mental balance,<br/>
					zestful and easeful,<br/>
					which is the second trance,<br/>
					may I abide therein', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'By the fading out of zest<br/>
					may I dwell <span class="f2 g"><b>[282]</b></span> indifferent,<br/>
					mindful and composed:<br/>
					entering on the third trance,<br/>
					which the Ariyans describe thus: —<br/>
					"He who is indifferent and mindful dwells happily"', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'By the abandoning of ease,<br/>
					by the abandoning of discomfort,<br/>
					by the ending of the happiness and unhappiness<br/>
					which I had before,<br/>
					having entered on that state<br/>
					which is neither pleasant nor painful,<br/>
					that utter purity of mindfulness<br/>
					reached by indifference,<br/>
					the fourth trance,<br/>
					may I abide therein', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Passing utterly beyond all consciousness of object,<br/>
					by ending the consciousness of reaction,<br/>
					by disregarding consciousness of diversity,<br/>
					thinking<br/>
					"infinite is space,"<br/>
					may I attain and abide in<br/>
					the sphere of infinite space', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Passing utterly beyond the sphere of the infinity of space,<br/>
					reaching the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					thinking<br/>
					"infinite is consciousness,"<br/>
					may I abide therein', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Passing utterly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br/>
					thinking<br/>
					"there is nothing at all,"<br/>
					reaching the sphere of nothingness<br/>
					may I abide therein', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Passing utterly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br/>
					and reaching the sphere of neither consciousness nor unconsciousness,<br/>
					let me abide therein', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, if a monk should desire:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Passing utterly beyond the sphere of neither consciousness nor unconsciousness,<br/>
					reaching the ceasing of consciousness and sensation,<br/>
					let me so abide', —<br/>
					he must give strict attention<br/>
					to this same intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, if intent concentration of this sort<br/>
					be cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					when he feels a pleasant feeling<br/>
					he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is impermanent.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not cling to it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It has no lure for me.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span> If he feels a painful feeling he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is impermanent.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not cling to it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It has no lure for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So also if he feels a feeling that is neutral he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is impermanent.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not cling to it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It has no lure for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a pleasant feeling,<br/>
					he feels it as one released from bondage to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a painful feeling,<br/>
					he feels it as one released from bondage to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a neutral feeling,<br/>
					he it as one released from bondage to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he has a feeling that his bodily endurance has reached its limit,<br/>
					he is aware that he so feels.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has a feeling that life has reached its limit,<br/>
					he is aware that he feels so.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When body breaks up,<br/>
					after life is used up,<br/>
					all my experiences in this world<br/>
					will lose their lure and grow cold.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks,<br/>
					because of oil and because of a wick<br/>
					a lamp keeps burning;<br/>
					but if oil and wick be used up<br/>
					the lamp would go out,<br/>
					because it is not fed, —<br/>
					even so, monks,<br/>
					if he has a feeling that his bodily endurance has reached its limit,<br/>
					he is aware that he so feels.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has a feeling that life has reached its limit,<br/>
					he is aware that he feels so.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When body breaks up,<br/>
					after life is used up,<br/>
					all my experiences in this world<br/>
					will lose their lure and grow cold.'"</p>
