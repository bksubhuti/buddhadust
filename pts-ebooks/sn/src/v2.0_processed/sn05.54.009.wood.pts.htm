					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Vesālī,<br/>
					in Great Wood,<br/>
					at the House with the peaked gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					the Exalted One was talking to the monks in divers ways<br/>
					on the subject of the unlovely,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a></sup></span><br/>
					was speaking in praise of the unlovely,<br/>
					was speaking in praise of meditation on the unlovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">After that the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I wish to dwell in solitude for the half-month.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I am not to be visited by anyone<br/>
					save by the single one who brings my food."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord," replied the monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[284]</b></span> Thus no one visited the Exalted One<br/>
					save only the single one who brought his food.</p>

					<p class="f4">So those monks, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Exalted One has in divers ways<br/>
					spoken on the subject of the unlovely,<br/>
					he has spoken in praise of the unlovely,<br/>
					he has spoken in praise of meditation on the unlovely,'</p>

					<p class="f4">spent their time given to meditation on the unlovely<br/>
					in all its varied applications.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this body,<br/>
					they worried about it,<br/>
					felt shame and loathing for it,<br/>
					and sought for a weapon to slay themselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, as many as ten monks<br/>
					did so in a single day;<br/>
					even twenty,<br/>
					thirty of them slew themselves<br/>
					in a single day.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at the end of that half-month<br/>
					the Exalted One,<br/>
					on returning from his solitary life,<br/>
					said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">The order of monks seems diminished."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to that, lord,<br/>
					the Exaited One spoke to the monks<br/>
					in divers ways on the subject of the unlovely,<br/>
					spoke in praise of the unlovely,<br/>
					spoke in praise of meditation on the unlovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monks, saying,<br/>
					'The Exalted One has in divers ways<br/>
					spoken on the subject of the unlovely,<br/>
					he has spoken in praise of the unlovely,<br/>
					he has spoken in praise of meditation on the unlovely,'<br/>
					spent their time given to meditation on the unlovely<br/>
					in all its varied applications.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this body,<br/>
					they worried about it,<br/>
					felt shame and loathing for it,<br/>
					and sought for a weapon to slay themselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, as many as ten monks<br/>
					did so in a single day;<br/>
					even twenty,<br/>
					thirty of them<br/>
					slew themselves in a single day.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were a good thing, lord,<br/>
					if the Exalted One would teach<br/>
					some other method,<br/>
					so that the order of monks<br/>
					might be established in gnosis."<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well then, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Summon the monks<br/>
					who dwell in the neighbourhood of Vesālī<br/>
					to the service-hall."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, lord,"<br/>
					replied the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					to the Exalted One,<br/>
					and, after summoning all the monks<br/>
					who dwelt in the neighbourhood of Vesālī<br/>
					to the service-hall,<br/>
					he came to the Exalted One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the order of monks is assembled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now let the Exalted One do as he deems fit."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[285]</b></span> Then the Exalted One went to the service-hall,<br/>
					and on arriving there<br/>
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, this intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a></sup></span><br/>
					is something peaceful and choice,<br/>
					something perfect in itself,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a></sup></span><br/>
					and a pleasant way of living too.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover it allays evil,<br/>
					unprofitable states<br/>
					that have arisen<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a></sup></span><br/>
					and makes them vanish in a moment.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Just as,monks,<br/>
					in the last month of the hot season<br/>
					the dust and dirt fly up,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a></sup></span><br/>
					and then out of due season<br/>
					a great rain-cloud lays them<br/>
					and makes them vanish in a moment, —<br/>
					even so intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					is something peaceful and choice,<br/>
					something perfect in itself,<br/>
					and a pleasant way of living too.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover it allays evil,<br/>
					unprofitable states<br/>
					that have arisen,<br/>
					and makes them vanish in a moment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how cultivated, monks,<br/>
					how made much of,<br/>
					is intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					something peaceful and choice,<br/>
					something perfect in itself,<br/>
					and a pleasant way of living.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does it allay evil,<br/>
					unprofitable states<br/>
					that have arisen<br/>
					and make them vanish in a moment?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this method a monk who<br/>
					having gotten himself off to the forest<br/>
					or the foot of a tree<br/>
					or a lonely place,<br/>
					sits down cross-legged,<br/>
					holding the body straight.<br/>
					Setting mindfulness in front of him,<br/>
					he breathes in mindfully<br/>
					and mindfully breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a long breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a short breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in,<br/>
					feeling it go through the whole body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling it go through the whole body<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/>
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aware of all mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of all mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus cultivated, monks,<br/>
					thus made much of,<br/>
					is intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					if cultivated and made much of,<br/>
					something peaceful and choice,<br/>
					something perfect in itself,<br/>
					and a pleasant way of living.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does it allay evil,<br/>
					unprofitable states<br/>
					that have arisen<br/>
					and make them vanish in a moment".</p>
