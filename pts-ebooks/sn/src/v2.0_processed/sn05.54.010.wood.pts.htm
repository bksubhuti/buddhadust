					<hr />

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Kimbilā,<br/>
					in Bamboo Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the venerable Kimbilā,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tell me, Kimbilā,<br/>
					how cultivated,<br/>
					how made much of,<br/>
					is the practice of intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					of great fruit,<br/>
					of great profit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the venerable Kimbilā was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the venerable Kimbilā,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tell me, Kimbilā,<br/>
					how cultivated,<br/>
					how made much of,<br/>
					is the practice of intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					of great fruit,<br/>
					of great profit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time at these words the venerable Kimbilā was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time<br/>
					the Exalted One addressed the venerable Kimbilā,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tell me, Kimbilā,<br/>
					how cultivated,<br/>
					how made much of,<br/>
					is the practice of intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					of great fruit,<br/>
					of great profit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time at these words the venerable Kimbilā was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time for this, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the time, O Happy One,<br/>
					for the Exalted One to develop<br/>
					the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing the Exalted One's words<br/>
					the monks will bear them in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well then, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you listen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					to the Exalted One, who said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How cultivated, Ānanda,<br/>
					how made much of<br/>
					is the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					of great fruit,<br/>
					of glreat profit?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this method, Ānanda, a monk<br/>
					a monk who goes to a forest<br/>
					or the foot of a tree<br/>
					or a lonely place,<br/>
					sits down cross-legged,<br/>
					holding the body straight.<br/>
					Setting mindfulness in front of him,<br/>
					he breathes in mindfully<br/>
					and mindfully breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a long breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a short breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in,<br/>
					feeling it go through the whole body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling it go through the whole body<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br/>
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aware of all mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of all mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus cultivated, Ānanda,<br/>
					thus made much of<br/>
					is the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					of great fruit,<br/>
					of glreat profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, at such time as a monk,<br/>
					while drawing in a long breath,<br/>
					knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I draw in';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, breathing out a long breath,<br/>
					knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I breathe out';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, when drawing in a short breath,<br/>
					knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I draw in';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, when breathing out a short breath,<br/>
					knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I breathe out';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, when he makes up his mind<br/>
					(repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Feeling it go through the whole body<br/>
					I shall <span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span> breathe in;<br/>
					feeling it go through the whole body<br/>
					I shall breathe out;<br/>
					calming down<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a></sup></span> the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe in;<br/>
					calming down the bodily aggregate<br/>
					I shall breathe out,' —</p>

					<p class="f4">at such time, Ānanda,<br/>
					in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient)<br/>
					a monk dwells ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, I declare<br/>
					that this in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					is a certain body.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda,<br/>
					a monk in body contemplating body<br/>
					(as transient)<br/>
					dwells ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Ānanda,<br/>
					at such time as a monk makes up his mind<br/>
					(repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Feeling the thrill of zest<br/>
					I shall breathe in:<br/>
					feeling the thrill of zest<br/>

					aware of the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br/>

					calming down the mental factors<br/>
					I shall breathe out," —<br/>
					at such time,<br/>
					in feelings contemplating feelings,<br/>
					he dwells ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed;<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda,<br/>
					I declare that this in-breathing and out-breathing,<br/>
					this close attention to it,<br/>
					is a certain feeling.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, a monk,<br/>
					in feelings contemplating feelings,<br/>
					at such time dwells ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Ānanda,<br/>
					at such time as a monk makes up his mind<br/>
					(repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aware of mind<br/>
					I shall breathe in:<br/>
					aware of mind<br/>
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gladdening my mind<br/>

					gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind<br/>
					I shall breathe in:<br/>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind<br/>
					I shall breathe in:<br/>

					<p class="f4">at such time,<br/>
					in mind <span class="f2 g"><b>[288]</b></span> contemplating mind<br/>
					(as transient),<br/>
					a monk dwells ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">I declare, Ānanda,<br/>
					that the practice of intent concentration<br/>
					on in-breathing and out-breathing<br/>
					is not a mindfulness that is relaxed<br/>
					or not composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, I say<br/>
					a monk dwells in mind contemplating mind,<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					selfpossessed<br/>
					and mindful,<br/>
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Ānanda,<br/>

					<p class="f4">'Contemplating impermanence<br/>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation<br/>
					I shall breathe in:<br/>
					contemplating renunciation<br/>

					<p class="f4">at such time,<br/>
					in mind-states contemplating mind-states,<br/>
					a 'monk dwells ardent,<br/>

					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning whatever dejection arises from coveting,<br/>
					seeing it<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a></sup></span> with the eye of insight,<br/>
					he is completely disinterested.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore I say, Ānanda,<br/>
					at such a time<br/>
					that monk dwells in mind-states contemplating mind-states,<br/>
					ardent,<br/>
					self-possessed,<br/>

					by restraining the dejection in the world<br/>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Ānanda, a heap of dust<br/>
					at the place where four high-roads meet,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Then from the western quarter<br/>

					<p class="f4">just so, Ānanda,<br/>

					<p class="f4">by dwelling in feelings contemplating feelings,<br/>
