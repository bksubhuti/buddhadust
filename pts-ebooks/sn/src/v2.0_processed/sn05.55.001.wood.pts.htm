					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, although a rājah,<br/>
					a roller of the wheel,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					holding supreme lordship and dominion<br/>
					over four continents,<br/>
					on the break-up of body<br/>
					is reborn after death in the Happy Lot,<br/>
					in the Heaven World,<br/>
					in the company of the Devas of the Thirty-Three;<br/>
					although he spends his time there<br/>
					in Nandana Grove,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					attended by a troop of nymphs,<br/>
					supplied and provided with,<br/>
					surrounded by,<br/>
					celestial pleasures of sense;<br/>
					although he is possessed of these four things,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span> -<br/>
					yet is he not released<br/>
					from Purgatory,<br/>
					he is not released<br/>
					from (birth in) the womb of an animal,<br/>
					he is not released<br/>
					from the realm of ghosts,<br/>
					he is not released<br/>
					from Hell,<br/>
					the Way of Woe,<br/>
					the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, although an Ariyan disciple<br/>
					lives on gathered scraps,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					though he be clothed in rags,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span><br/>
					yet is he possessed of four things;<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[297]</b></span> moreover be is released<br/>
					from Purgatory,<br/>
					be is released<br/>
					from (birth in) the womb of an animal,<br/>
					he is released<br/>
					from the realm of ghosts,<br/>
					he is released<br/>
					from Hell,<br/>
					the Way of Woe,<br/>
					from the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four things?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br/>
					of unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">(He has faith that)</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span><br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed of unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed of unwavering faith in the Order,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>
					namely,<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he is possessed<br/>
					of the virtues loved by the Ariyans,<br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>
					whole,<br/>
					unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise:<br/>
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the four things he is possessed of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there is the winning of four continents,<br/>
					and there is the winning of the four things.</p>

					<p class="f4">But to win four continents<br/>
					is not worth a sixteenth part<br/>
					of the winning of the four things."</p>
