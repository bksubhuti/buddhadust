					<hr />

					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[298]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha,<br/>
					in Bamboo Grove,<br/>
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[299]</b></span> Now on that occasion Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br/>
					was sick<br/>
					afflicted,<br/>
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br/>
					called to his father Jotika the housefather,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you go to the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him,<br/>
					with your head worship at the feet of the Exalted One,<br/>
					and say in my name:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br/>
					is sick,<br/>
					afflicted,<br/>
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He worships with his head<br/>
					at the Exalted One's feet.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It were a good thing, lord,<br/>
					if the Exalted One would come to the house<br/>
					of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br/>
					out of compassion for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, my lad,"<br/>
					said Jotika the housefather<br/>
					in reply to Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br/>
					and went to the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Jotika the housefather<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br/>
					is sick,<br/>
					afflicted,<br/>
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He worships with his head<br/>
					at the feet of the Exalted One<br/>
					and says thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It were a good thing, lord,<br/>
					if the Exalted One would come to the house<br/>
					of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br/>
					out of compassion for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One consented by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One robed himself,<br/>
					and taking bowl and outer robe<br/>
					set off for the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br/>
					and on arriving there<br/>
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having sat down<br/>
					the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to Dīghāvu the lay-disciple:<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Dīghāvu,<br/>
					I hope you are bearing up,<br/>
					I hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br/>
					and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating<br/>
					and not increasing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating<br/>
					but of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Dīghāvu,<br/>
					thus must you train yourself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will be blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He it <span class="f2 g"><b>[300]</b></span> is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will be blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will be blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>
					namely,<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also I will be blessed<br/>
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>
					whole,<br/>
					unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise:<br/>
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Dīghāvu,<br/>
					is how you must train yourself."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to these four limbs of stream-winning, lord,<br/>
					which have been taught by the Exalted One,<br/>
					all of those conditions<br/>
					are to be found in me,<br/>
					and I do live in accordance with them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, I am indeed blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I am indeed blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I am indeed blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>

					which lead to concentration of the mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, Dīghāvu,<br/>
					resting on these four limbs of stream-winning,<br/>
					you should further practise<br/>
					the six conditions<br/>
					which are constituent parts of knowledge.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Dīghāvu, do you dwell<br/>
					contemplating impermanence<br/>
					in all the activities,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					conscious of ill<br/>
					in impermanence,<br/>
					conscious of there being no self<br/>
					in what is ill,<br/>
					conscious of abandoning,<br/>
					of dispassion,<br/>
					of cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Dīghāvu,<br/>
					is how you must train yourself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, as to these same six conditions,<br/>
					which are constituent parts of knowledge,<br/>
					all of them are to be found in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do live<br/>
					contemplating impermanence<br/>
					in all the activities,<br/>
					conscious of ill<br/>
					in impermanence,<br/>
					conscious of there being no self<br/>
					in what is ill,<br/>
					conscious of abandoning,<br/>
					of dispassion,<br/>
					of cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, lord, I have this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would not have the housefather Jotika here<br/>
					fall into dejection at my death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Don't you trouble about that, Dīghāvu, my lad!<br/>
					(said his father).</p>

					<p class="f4">Look you, Dīghāvu, my lad!</p>

					<p class="f4">Attend closely to what the Exalted One is saying to you."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span> So the Exalted One,<br/>
					having thus admonished Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br/>
					rose from his seat and went awray.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after the Exalted One had gone<br/>
					Dīghāvu the lay-disciple made an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon a number of monks<br/>
					went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, that lay-disciple named Dīghāvu,<br/>
					who was admonished in brief by the Exalted One,<br/>
					has made an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his lot?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his destiny in the life to come?"<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"A sage, monks, was Dīghāvu the lay-disciple.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lived according to the Norm.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He did not harm me<br/>
					by disputings about the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dīghāvu, the lay-disciple, monks,<br/>
					by wearing out the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/>
					is reborn by spontaneous birth.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">His destiny<br/>
					is not to return from that world."</p>
