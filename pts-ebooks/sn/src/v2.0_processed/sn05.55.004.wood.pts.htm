					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					were staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					rising up from his solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to see the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tell me, friend Sāriputta,<br/>
					through winning possession<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> of what things<br/>
					are people of this world<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					as stream-winners,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for enlightenment?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, it is because of winning four things<br/>
					that people of this world<br/>
					are proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					as stream-wmners,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four things?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[302]</b></span> Herein, friend, an Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>
					namely,<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>
					whole,<br/>
					unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise:<br/>
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, friend, are the four things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to being blessed with these,<br/>
					people of this world<br/>
					are proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					as stream-wmners,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for enlightenment.</p>
