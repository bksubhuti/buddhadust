					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One<br/>
					was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					a number of monks were busied<br/>
					with making a robe for the Exalted One,<br/>
					with this idea:</p>

					<p class="f4">When the robe is finished,<br/>
					in three months' time,<br/>
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Isidatta and Purāṇa, the chamberlains,<br/>
					were staying at Sadhuka<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they heard the news:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They say that a number of monks<br/>
					are busied with making a robe for the Exalted One<br/>
					with this idea:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When the robe is finished,<br/>
					in three months' time,<br/>
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Isidatta and Purāṇa, the chamberlains,<br/>
					stationed a man on the high-road<br/>
					(thus instructing him):</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, good fellow,<br/>
					as soon as you see that Exalted one,<br/>
					that Arahant,<br/>
					that perfectly Enlightened One<br/>
					coming along,<br/>
					do you ecme and inform us."</p>

					<p class="f4">So after standing there two or three days<br/>
					that man saw the Exalted One coming along,<br/>
					while yet some distance off,<br/>
					and he went to inform the chamberlains, Isidatta and Purāṇa,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here comes my lord the Exalted One,<br/>
					that Arahant,<br/>
					that perfectly Enlightened One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now's the time for you to do what you want!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So Isidatta and Purāṇa, the chamberlains,<br/>
					went towards the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him,<br/>
					saluted him,<br/>
					and followed behind the Exalted One<br/>
					step for step.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One turned aside from the high-road<br/>
					and went to the foot of a certain tree<br/>
					and there sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Isidatta and Purāṇa, the chamberlains,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span> saluting the Exalted One,<br/>
					also sat down<br/>
					at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus sat<br/>
					they said this to the Exalted One:</p>

'Further, there are the carriage-builders, Isidatta and Purāṇa, whom I support, who make my carnages <i>(mama bhattā, mama yānā),</i> who owe to me their livelihood and the honours they enjoy. Withal, these men do not serve me as whole-heartedly as they do the Lord. Time was when, being out with my troops on active service, I, to test these two, took up my quarters in a cramped little house, where Isidatta and Puraiia, after spending the best part of the night in discussing the Doctrine, lay down to rest with their heads in the direction where they heard the Lord was, and only their feet towards me. It is wonderful and marvellous, thought I to myself, that these two men, who owe everythmg in the world to me, yet do not serve me as they serve the Lord.
