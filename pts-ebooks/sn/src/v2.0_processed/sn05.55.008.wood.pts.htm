					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[311]</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Ñatika,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					in Brick Hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Ānanda came to see the Exalted One<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[312]</b></span> "Lord, the monk named Sāḷha bas made an end.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What is his lot?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his destiny in the life to come?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, the nun named Nandā has made an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is her lot?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is her destiny in the life to come?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, Sudatta, the lay-disciple has made an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his lot?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his destiny in the life to come?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, Sujata,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span> the lay-woman disciple has made an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is her lot?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is her destiny in the life to come?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"The monk Sāḷha, Ānanda,<br/>
					who has made an end,<br/>
					by destroying the <i>āsavas,</i><br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					by his own understanding<br/>
					realized the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					and attaining to it<br/>
					dwelt therein.</p>

						

					<p class="f4">Nandā the nun, Ānanda,<br/>
					who has made an end,<br/>
					by wearing out the five fetters of the lower sort,<br/>
					has taken birth spontaneously<br/>
					(in the Pure Abodes),<br/>
					there to pass away,<br/>
					destined never to return thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sudatta, the lay-disciple, Ānanda,<br/>
					who has made an end,<br/>
					by destroying three fetters<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a></sup></span><br/>
					and by weakening those of lust,<br/>
					hatred<br/>
					and delusion,<br/>
					is a once-returner:<br/>
					coming back to this world just once more<br/>
					he will make an end of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sujātā, the lay-woman disciple, Ānanda,<br/>
					who has made an end,<br/>
					by destroying three fetters,<br/>
					is a stream-winner,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Ānanda,<br/>
					it is no wonder<br/>
					that a human being should make an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if, when each one dies,<br/>
					you come and ask me about the matter,<br/>
					it is troublesome to the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, I wi11 teach you a Norm-teaching<br/>
					called 'The Mirror of the Norm,'<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a></sup></span><br/>
					possessing which<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple may,<br/>
					if he please,<br/>
					himself proclaim of himself<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Cut off for me is Purgatory,<br/>
					cut off is rebirth in an animal womb,<br/>
					cut off is the realm of ghosts,<br/>
					the Woeful Way and the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stream-winner am I,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					one bound for enlightenment!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[313]</b></span> And of what sort, Ānanda,<br/>
					is that Norm-teaching<br/>
					called 'Mirror of the Norm,'<br/>
					possessed of which<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple may,<br/>
					if he please,<br/>
					himself proclaim of himself<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Cut off for me is Purgatory,<br/>
					cut off is rebirth in an animal womb,<br/>
					cut off is the realm of ghosts,<br/>
					the Woeful Way and the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stream-winner am I,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					one bound for enlightenment!'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>
					namely,<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>
					whole,<br/>
					unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise:<br/>
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is that Norm-teaching<br/>
					called 'Mirror of the Norm,' possessed of which which<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple may,<br/>
					if he please,<br/>
					himself proclaim of himself<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Cut off for me is Purgatory,<br/>
					cut off is rebirth in an animal womb,<br/>
					cut off is the realm of ghosts,<br/>
					the Woeful Way and the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stream-winner am I,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					one bound for enlightenment!'"</p>
