					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>

					unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise:<br/>
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is that Norm-teaching<br/>
