					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta<br/>
					and the venerable Ānanda<br/>
					were staying near Sāvatthī<br/>
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta,<br/>
					rising from his solitude at eventide,<br/>
					went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>
					the venerable Sāriputta said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Ānanda,<br/>
					by abandoning what things,<br/>
					by winning possession of what things,<br/>
					are people of this world<br/>
					proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					as stream-winners,<br/>
					as not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					as assured,<br/>
					as bound for enlightenment?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, it is by abandoning four things,<br/>
					it is by winning possession of four things,<br/>
					that people of this world<br/>
					are proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					as stream-winners,<br/>
					as not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					as assured,<br/>
					as bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four things?</p>

					<p class="f4">One has no such disloyalty to the Buddha<br/>
					as that possessed by the uneducated manyfolk<br/>
					who, when body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					are reborn in Hell,<br/>
					in the Woeful Lot,<br/>
					the Downfall,<br/>
					in Purgatory:<br/>
					but he has such unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/>
					as is possessed by the educated Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					who, when the body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					is reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/>
					in the Heaven World<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">One has no such disloyalty to the Norm<br/>
					as that possessed by the uneducated manyfolk<br/>
					who, when body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					are reborn in Hell,<br/>
					in the Woeful Lot,<br/>
					the Downfall,<br/>
					in Purgatory:<br/>
					but he has such unwavering loyalty to the Norm<br/>
					as is possessed by the educated Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					who, when the body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					is reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/>
					in the Heaven World,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">One has no such disloyalty to the Order<br/>
					as that possessed by the uneducated manyfolk<br/>
					who, when body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					are reborn in Hell,<br/>
					in the Woeful Lot,<br/>
					the Downfall,<br/>
					in Purgatory:<br/>
					but he has such unwavering loyalty to the Order<br/>
					as is possessed by the educated Ariyan disciple,<br/>
					who, when the body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					is reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/>
					in the Heaven World,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>
					namely,<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>
