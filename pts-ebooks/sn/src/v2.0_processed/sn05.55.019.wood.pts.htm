					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/>
					just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br/>
					or draw in his outstretched arm, -<br/>
					even so did he vanish from Jeta Grove<br/>
					and appear among the Devas of the Thirty-Three.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of the Devas of the Thirty-Three<br/>
					came to see the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus stood<br/>
					the venerable Moggallāna the Great said this to those Devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a good thing, friends,<br/>
					to be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result of being blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/>
					some beings here,<br/>
					when body breaks up,<br/>
					after death<br/>
					have been<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> reborn in the Happy Lot,<br/>
					in the Heaven World.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a good thing, friends, to be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>

					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>
