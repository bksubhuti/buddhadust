					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br/>
					near Kapilavatthu,<br/>
					in the Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>
					Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, this town of Kapilavatthu is rich,<br/>
					prosperous, populous,<br/>
					crowded with men,<br/>
					a dense mass of folk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lord, when I enter Kapilavatthu at eventide<br/>
					after waiting upon the Exalted One<br/>
					or the worshipful monks,<br/>
					I meet with elephants,<br/>
					horses, chariots,<br/>
					carts and men,<br/>
					all swaying and rolling along.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such times, lord, my thoughts,<br/>
					which are fixed on the Exalted One,<br/>
					on the Norm and the Order,<br/>
					are simply bewildered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurs to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If I were at this very moment to make an end,<br/>
					what would be my lot,<br/>
					what would be my destiny<br/>
					in the life to come?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have no fears, Mahānāma!<br/>
					Have no fears, Mahānāma!</p>

					<p class="f4">Blameless will be your death.</p>

					<p class="f4">You will make a blameless end.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the Ariyan disciple, Mahānāma,<br/>
					who is blessed with four things,<br/>
					bends to Nibbāna,<br/>
					slopes to Nibbāna,<br/>
					tends to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four things?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Mahānāma,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant, a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed<br/>
					of unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed<br/>
					of unwavering faith in the Order, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>
					namely, the four airs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.<br/>
					That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clsped hands,<br/>
					— a field of merit unsurpassed for theworld.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he is possessed<br/>
					of the virtues loved by the Ariyans,<br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>
					whole, unspotted, untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise:<br/>
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">For instance, Mahānāma,<br/>
					if a tree bends to the east,<br/>
					slopes to the east,<br/>
					tends to the east,<br/>
					which way will it fall<br/>
					when its root is cut?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It will fall whither it bends,<br/>
					slopes and tends, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just so, Mahānāma,<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with four things<br/>
					bends to Nibbāna,<br/>
					slopes to Nibbāna,<br/>
					tends to Nibbāna."</p>
