					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu,<br/>
					in the Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan<br/>
					came to see Godha<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> the Sakyan,<br/>
					and on coming to him said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Godha, so far as you know,<br/>
					blessed with how many things<br/>
					is a stream-winner (declared)<br/>
					one not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for enlightenment?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I know, Mahānāma,<br/>
					that he is blessed with three things.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are they?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Mahānāma, the Ariyan disciple has unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>
					namely,<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Blessed with these three things, Mahānāma,<br/>
					the stream-winner is (declared)<br/>
					one not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as far as you know, Mahānāma,<br/>
					blessed with how many things<br/>
					is a stream-winner (declared)<br/>
					one not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for enlightenment?"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"For my part, Godha, I know<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					that he is blessed with four things.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are they?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Mahānāma, the Ariyan disciple has unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>

					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>

					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>

					<p class="f4">And he is blessed<br/>
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>
					whole,<br/>
					unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise:<br/>
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four things, Godha,<br/>
					blessed with which<br/>
					I know a stream-winner is<br/>
					one not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>

					<p class="f4">"Wait a bit, Mahānāma!</p>

					<p class="f4">Wait a bit, Mahānāma!</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One will know about this,<br/>
					whether one is blessed with these four things or not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go to see the Exalted One<br/>

					<p class="f4">So Mahānāma and Godha the Sakyans<br/>
					went to see the Exalted One<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side then
					Mahānāma the Sakyan<br/>
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a></sup></span> I came to see Godha the Sakyan,<br/>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go to see the Exalted One<br/>

					<p>[So Godha and I<br/>
					came to see the Exalted One.]</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[323]</b></span> Now suppose, lord, some question of doctrine arises,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>

					and on the other side is the Order of monks,<br/>
					I myself should be on the side of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my lord the Exalted One accept this<br/>

					<p class="f4">Again suppose, lord, some question of doctrine arises,<br/>

					<p class="f4">So again, lord, if on the one side were the Exalted one,<br/>
					on the other side the Order,<br/>
					both of monks and nuns,<br/>

					I myself should side with the Exalted One</p>

					<p class="f4">or if again on the other side were the Order,<br/>

					<p class="f4">if added to these were the whole world,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Let my lord the Exalted One accept this<br/>

					<p class="f4">(Then, said the Exalted One, turning to Godha):</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, of Mahānāma,<br/>
