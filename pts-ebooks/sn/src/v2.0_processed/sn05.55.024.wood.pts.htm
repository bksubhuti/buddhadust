					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br/>
					near Kapilavatthu,<br/>
					in the Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br/>
					who had made an end,<br/>
					was proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					one bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon a number of Sakyans,<br/>
					whenever they met <span class="f2 g"><b>[324]</b></span> together in company,<br/>
					were consumed with indignation,<br/>
					and spoke angrily and scornfully<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> about him<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A strange thing indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">A wonder indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">Nowadays-anyone may become a stream-winner,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					inasmuch as Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br/>
					who bas died,<br/>
					is proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					one bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why! Sarakāni the Sakyan failed in the training<br/>
					and took to drink!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br/>
					Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, lord, Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br/>
					who has died,<br/>
					was proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					one bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon a number of Sakyans, whenever they meet together in company,<br/>
					were consumed with indignation,<br/>
					and spoke angrily and scornfully about him<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A strange thing indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">A wonder indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">Nowadays-anyone may become a stream-winner,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Why! Sarakāni the Sakyan failed in the training<br/>
					and took to drink!'"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mahānāma, a lay-disciple<br/>
					who has for a long time taken refuge in the Buddha,<br/>
					taken refuge in the Norm<br/>
					taken refuge in the Order, -<br/>
					how could such an one go to the Downfall?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who would rightly apply the words<br/>
					'A lay-disciple who has gone for refuge to the Buddha,<br/>
					who has gone for refuge to the Norm<br/>
					who has gone for refuge to the Order'<br/>
					might rightly apply them to Sarakāni the Sakyan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mahānāma, Sarakāni the Sakyan is one who<br/>
					for a long time took refuge in the Buddha,<br/>
					took refuge in the Norm<br/>
					took refuge in the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">How could such an one go to the Downfall?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now herein, Mahānāma,<br/>
					take the case of a man<br/>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>

					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>

					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover he is one who is joyous<br/>
					and swift in wisdom,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					one who has won release.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now by the destruction <span class="f2 g"><b>[325]</b></span> of the āsavas,<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					by bis own understanding<br/>
					he bas realized the heart's release,<br/>
					the release by insight,<br/>
					and having attained it<br/>
					dwells therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, Mahānāma,<br/>
					is fully released from hell,<br/>
					from rebirth in an animal's womb,<br/>
					from the realm of ghosts,<br/>
					he is fully released from the Waste,<br/>
					the Woeful Way,<br/>
					from the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But suppose again in this connexion, Mahānāma,<br/>

					<p class="f4">He is joyous and swift in wisdom,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Yet by destroying the five fetters of the lower sort<br/>
