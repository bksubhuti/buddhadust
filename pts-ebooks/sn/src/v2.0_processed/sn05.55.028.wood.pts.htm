					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br/>
					the Exalted One said this<br/>
					to the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Housefather, when the fivefold guilty dread<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					is allayed in the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					and he is possessed of the four limbs of stream-winning,<br/>
					and has well seen and well penetrated<br/>
					the Ariyan Method<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> by insight,<br/>
					he, if he so desire,<br/>
					may himself proclaim thus of himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am one who has cut off the doom of Hell,<br/>
					of rebirth in an animal's womb,<br/>
					in the Realm of Ghosts;<br/>
					cut off is the Waste,<br/>
					the Woeful Way,<br/>
					the Downfall;<br/>
					a Stream-winner am I,<br/>
					one not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for enlightenment!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, what is the fivefold guilty dread<br/>
					that is allayed in him?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is that guilty dread, housefather,<br/>
					which he who kills begets -<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					as a result of his killing;</p>

					<p class="f4">it is that guilty dread <span class="f2 g"><b>[334]</b></span><br/>
					about the future life,<br/>
					which be who kills begets;</p>

					<p class="f4">that feeling of painful dejection felt by him,<br/>
					that guilty dread,<br/>
					is allayed in him who abstains from killing.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That same guilty dread, housefather,<br/>
					which he who steals begets -<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					as a result of his stealing;</p>

					<p class="f4">it is that guilty dread<br/>
					about the future life,<br/>
					which be who steals begets;</p>

					<p class="f4">that feeling of painful dejection felt by him,<br/>
					that guilty dread,<br/>
					is allayed in him who abstains from stealing.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That same guilty dread, housefather,<br/>
					which he who is of wrong practice in sensual lust begets -<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					as a result of his wrong practice in sensual lust;</p>

					<p class="f4">it is that guilty dread<br/>
					about the future life,<br/>
					which be who is of wrong practice in sensual lust begets;</p>

					<p class="f4">that feeling of painful dejection felt by him,<br/>
					that guilty dread,<br/>
					is allayed in him who abstains from wrong practice in sensual lust.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That same guilty dread, housefather,<br/>
					which he who speaks falsehood begets -<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					as a result of his false speech;</p>

					<p class="f4">it is that guilty dread<br/>
					about the future life,<br/>
					which be who speaks falsehood begets;</p>

					<p class="f4">that feeling of painful dejection felt by him,<br/>
					that guilty dread,<br/>
					is allayed in him who abstains from false speech.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That same guilty dread, housefather,<br/>
					which he who is addicted to the negligence caused by liquor and intoxicants begets -<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					as a result of his addiction to the negligence caused by liquor and intoxicants;</p>

					<p class="f4">it is that guilty dread<br/>
					about the future life,<br/>
					which be who is addicted to the negligence caused by liquor and intoxicants begets;</p>

					<p class="f4">that feeling of painful dejection felt by him,<br/>
					that guilty dread,<br/>
					is allayed in him who abstains from addiction to the negligence caused by liquor and intoxicants.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is the guilty dread that is allayed in him.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And with what four limbs of stream-winning is he blessed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, an Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>
					namely,<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>
					whole,<br/>
					unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise:<br/>
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four limbs of stream-winning with which he is blessed.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, housefather, is the Ariyan Method<br/>
					which he has well seen<br/>
					and well penetrated by insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					well and thoroughly attends<br/>
					to the arising-by-way-of-cause,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">This being,<br/>
					that is.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the arising of this,<br/>
					that arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">This not being,<br/>
					that is not.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the ceasing of this,<br/>
					that ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus conditioned by ignorance,<br/>
					activities come to pass.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by the activities,<br/>
					consciousness:<br/>
					conditioned by consciousness,<br/>
					name-and-shape:<br/>
					conditioned by name-and-shape,<br/>
					sense:<br/>
					conditioned by sense,<br/>
					contact:<br/>
					conditioned by contact,<br/>
					feeling:<br/>
					conditioned by feeling,<br/>
					craving:<br/>
					conditioned by craving,<br/>
					grasping:<br/>
					conditioned by grasping,<br/>
					becoming:<br/>
					conditioned by becoming,<br/>
					birth:<br/>
					conditioned by birth,<br/>
					old age and death,<br/>
					grief,<br/>
					lamentation,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow and despair<br/>
					come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the arising of this whole mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading and ceasing of ignorance<br/>
					comes the ceasing of activities:<br/>
					from ceasing of activities,<br/>
					ceasing of consciousness:<br/>
					from ceasing of consciousness,<br/>
					ceasing of name- <span class="f2 g"><b>[335]</b></span> and-shape:<br/>
					from ceasing of name-and-shape,<br/>
					ceasing of sense:<br/>
					from ceasing of sense,<br/>
					ceasing of contact:<br/>
					from ceasing of contact,<br/>
					ceasing of feeling:<br/>
					from ceasing of feeling,<br/>
					ceasing of craving:<br/>
					from ceasing of craving,<br/>
					ceasing of grasping:<br/>
					from ceasing of grasping,<br/>
					ceasing of becoming:<br/>
					from ceasing of becoming,<br/>
					ceasing of birth:<br/>
					from ceasing of birth,<br/>
					ceasing of old age and death,<br/>
					grief,<br/>
					lamentation,<br/>
					suffering,<br/>
					sorrow and despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this whole mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the Ariyan Method which he has well seen and wrell penetrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, since in the Ariyan disciple this fivefold guilty dread is allayed,<br/>
					since he is blessed with these four limbs of stream-winning,<br/>
					and has well seen<br/>
					and well penetrated<br/>
					this Ariyan Method,<br/>
					he, if he so desire,<br/>
					may himself proclaim of himself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am one who has cut off the doom of Hell,<br/>
					of rebirth in the womb of an animal,<br/>
					in the Realm of Ghosts,<br/>
					the Waste,<br/>
					the Woeful Way,<br/>
					the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stream-winner am I,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for enlightenment!'"</p>
