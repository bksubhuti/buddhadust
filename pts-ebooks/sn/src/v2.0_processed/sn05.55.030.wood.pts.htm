					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Vesālī,<br/>
					in Great Grove,<br/>
					at the House of the Peaked Gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Nandaka, minister of the Licchavī,<br/>
					came to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					and on coming to him<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br/>
					the Exalted One said this to Nandaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nandaka, possessed of four things<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple is a Stream-winner,<br/>
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br/>
					assured,<br/>
					bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Nandaka, an Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[336]</b></span> thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>
					namely,<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br/>
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>
					whole,<br/>
					unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise:<br/>
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Blessed with these four things<br/>
					the Ariyan disciple is also blessed with long life,<br/>
					both heavenly and human,<br/>
					blessed with beauty,<br/>
					blessed with happiness,<br/>
					blessed with good name,<br/>
					and blessed with sovereignty,<br/>
					both heavenly and human.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, Nandaka, I know,<br/>
					not from hearsay of any recluse or brahmin,<br/>
					but I have ascertained it for myself,<br/>
					seen it for myself,<br/>
					understood it for myself,<br/>
					and so do I tell it you."</p>

					<p class="f4">Just then someone came up to Nandaka, the minister of the Licchavī,<br/>
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is time for your bath, my lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough of that, good fellow!"<br/>
					said Nandaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough of this outward washing!</p>

					<p class="f4">This inner washing<br/>
					shall be enough for me,<br/>
					to wit:<br/>
					this loyalty to the Exalted One."</p>
