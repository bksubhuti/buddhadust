					<p class="f4">THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Kapilavatthu,<br/>
					in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahanama the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side<br/>
					he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, how far is one a disciple?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[339]</b></span> "By going for refuge to the Buddha, Mahanama,<br/>
					to the Norm<br/>
					and to the Order,<br/>
					one is a disciple."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, how far is a disciple virtuous?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the time when a disciple<br/>
					abstains from killing,<br/>
					abstains from stealing,<br/>
					abstains from wrong conduct in sensual lusts,<br/>
					abstains from falsehood<br/>
					abstains from addiction to the neglect caused by intoxicants, -<br/>
					thus far, Mahanama, a disciple is virtuous."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, how far is a disciple a believer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, Mahanama, a disciple believes in the wisdom of the Tathāgata,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is, the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpsassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far, Mahanama, a disciple is a believer."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, how far is a disciple given to generosity?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, Mahanama, a disciple dwells at home<br/>
					with a heart freed from the taint of stinginess.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is open-handed,<br/>
					pure-banded,<br/>
					delighting in self-surrender,<br/>
					one to ask a favour of,<br/>
					one who rejoices in the dispensing of charitable gifts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far, Mahanama, a disciple is given to generosity."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, how far is a disciple blessed with insight?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, Mahanama, a disciple is a sage,<br/>
					blessed with insight<br/>
					into the rise and fall of things,<br/>
					insight which is Ariyan,<br/>
					penetrating,<br/>
					going on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far, Mahanama, a disciple is possessed of insight."</p>
