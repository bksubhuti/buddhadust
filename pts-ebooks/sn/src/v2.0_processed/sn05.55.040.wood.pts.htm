					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Kapilavatthu, in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Nandiya the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, if an Ariyan disciple is<br/>
					in every way,<br/>
					altogether,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[341]</b></span> in every respect<br/>
					and utterly,<br/>
					without the four limbs of stream-winning,<br/>
					can he in such case be called<br/>
					'An Ariyan disciple who lives remiss?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of such an one, Nandiya, who<br/>
					in every way,<br/>
					altogether,<br/>
					in every respect<br/>
					and utterly,<br/>
					without the four limbs of stream-winning,<br/>
					I declare him to be one who stands without,<br/>
					in the ranks of the manyfolk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Nandiya, I will tell you<br/>
					how the Ariyan disciple is one who lives remiss<br/>
					and one who lives in earnest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you listen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind<br/>
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, lord,"<br/>
					replied Nandiya the Sakyan to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, Nandiya, is the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					one who dwells remiss?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Nandiya, the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is content with that unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					but he makes no further effort,<br/>
					either to get seclusion by day<br/>
					or meditation by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus dwells remiss<br/>
					he has no delight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without delight in a thing<br/>
					there is no zest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Zest lacking,<br/>
					there is no calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without calm<br/>
					one dwells in discomfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who dwells in discomfort<br/>
					the mind is not tranquillized.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the mind that is not tranquillized<br/>
					the teachings do not show clear.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the teachings being obscure to him<br/>
					he is reckoned one who dwells remiss.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, suppose the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>

					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>

					worthy of reverence,<br/>
