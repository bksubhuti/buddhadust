					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Kapilavatthu,<br/>
					in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br/>
					a number of monks were busied<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br/>
					"for," said they,<br/>
					"when the rains are over,<br/>
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan heard it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A number of monks are busied<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br/>
					'for,' said they,<br/>
					'when the rains are over,<br/>
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds'"<br/>
					and he went to the Exalted One,<br/>
					saluted him<br/>
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br/>
					Mahanama the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hear it said, lord,<br/>
					that a number of monks are busied<br/>
					making robes for the Exalted One<br/>
					with the idea that,<br/>
					when the rains are over,<br/>
					the Exalted One will set forth on his rounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lord, we have never heard<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					from the Exalted One's own lips<br/>
					how a discreet<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> lay-disciple who is sick,<br/>
					afflicted,<br/>
					suffering from a sore disease,<br/>
					should be admonished by another discreet lay-disciple."</p>

					<p class="f4">"A discreet lay-disciple, Mahānāma,<br/>
					who is sick,<br/>
					afflicted,<br/>
					suffering from a sore disease,<br/>
					should be admonished by another discreet lay-disciple<br/>
					with the four comfortable assurances,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Take comfort, dear sir,<br/>
					in your unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He it is the Exalted One,<br/>
					Arahant,<br/>
					a fully Enlightened One,<br/>
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br/>
					a Happy One,<br/>
					world-knower,<br/>
					unsurpassed charioteer<br/>
					of men to be tamed,<br/>
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br/>
					a Buddha,<br/>
					an Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">Take comfort, dear sir, in your unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br/>
					is the Norm,<br/>
					seen in this very life,<br/>
					a thing not involving time,<br/>
					inviting one to come and see,<br/>
					leading onward,<br/>
					to be known for themselves<br/>
					by the wise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Take comfort, dear sir,<br/>
					in your unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br/>
					walking uprightly,<br/>
					walking in the right way,<br/>
					walking dutifully<br/>
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br/>
					namely,<br/>
					the four pairs of men,<br/>
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br/>
					worthy of reverence,<br/>
					worthy of offerings,<br/>
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br/>
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world."</p>

					<p class="f4">Take comfort, dear sir, in your possession of the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a></sup></span><br/>
					virtues unbroken,<br/>
					whole,<br/>
					unspotted,<br/>
					untarnished,<br/>
					giving freedom,<br/>
					praised by the wise:<br/>
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br/>
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A discreet lay-disciple, Mahānāma,<br/>
					who is sick,<br/>
					afflicted,<br/>
					suffering from a sore disease,<br/>
					should be <span class="f2 g"><b>[350]</b></span> admonished by another discreet lay-disciple<br/>
					with these four comfortable assurances.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, supposing he has longing for his parents,<br/>
					he should thus be spoken to:</p>

					<p class="f4">If he say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have longing for my parents,'</p>

					<p class="f4">the other should reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But, my dear sir,<br/>

					<p class="f4">Whether you feel longing for your parents or not,<br/>
					you will have to die.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Twere just as well for you<br/>

					<p class="f4">If he should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, if he say:</p>
