					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever clansmen have<br/>
					in time past<br/>
					rightly gone forth from the home<br/>
					to the homeless life,<br/>
					who have fully comprehended what really is<br/>
					all of them have fully comprehended,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					the Four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen shall<br/>
					in future time<br/>
					rightly go forth from the home<br/>
					to the homeless life,<br/>
					who will fully comprehend what really is<br/>
					all of them will do so<br/>
					to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths,<br/>
					as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen<br/>
					do now<br/>
					rightly go forth from the home<br/>
					to the homeless life,<br/>
					who fully comprehend what really is<br/>
					all of them do so<br/>
					to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth of the practice<br/>
					that leads to the ceasing of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever clansmen have<br/>
					in time past<br/>
					rightly gone forth from the home<br/>
					to the homeless life,<br/>
					who have fully comprehended what really is<br/>
					all of them have fully comprehended,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					the Four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen shall<br/>
					in future time<br/>
					rightly go forth from the home<br/>
					to the homeless life,<br/>
					who will fully comprehend what really is<br/>
					all of them will do so<br/>
					to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths,<br/>
					as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen<br/>
					do now<br/>
					rightly go forth from the home<br/>
					to the homeless life,<br/>
					who fully comprehend what really is<br/>
					all of them do so<br/>
					to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
