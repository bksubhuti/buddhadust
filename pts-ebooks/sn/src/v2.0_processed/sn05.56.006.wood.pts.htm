					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/>
					in time past<br/>
					have declared that they have in very truth<br/>
					gained the highest wisdom,<br/>
					all of them have declared<br/>
					that they have penetrated<br/>
					in very truth,<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses<br/>
					in future time<br/>
					will declare that they have in very truth<br/>
					gained the highest wisdom,<br/>
					all of them will declare<br/>
					that they have penetrated<br/>
					in very truth,<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins<br/>
					in the present time<br/>
					do declare that they have in very truth<br/>
					gained the highest wisdom,<br/>
					all of them do declare<br/>
					that they have penetrated<br/>
					in very truth,<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth of the practice<br/>
					that leads to the ceasing of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/>
					in time past<br/>
					have declared that they have in very truth<br/>
					gained the highest wisdom,<br/>
					all of them have declared<br/>
					that they have penetrated<br/>
					in very truth,<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses<br/>
					in future time<br/>
					will declare that they have in very truth<br/>
					gained the highest wisdom,<br/>
					all of them will declare<br/>
					that they have penetrated<br/>
					in very truth,<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins<br/>
					in the present time<br/>
					do declare that they have in very truth<br/>
					gained the highest wisdom,<br/>
					all of them do declare<br/>
					that they have penetrated<br/>
					in very truth,<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
