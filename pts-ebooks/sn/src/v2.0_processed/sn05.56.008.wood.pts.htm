					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, reason not ill,<br/>
					unprofitable reasonings,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					such as:</p>

					<p class="f4">Eternal is the world<br/>
					or Not eternal is the world:</p>

					<p class="f4">Finite is the world<br/>
					or Infinite is the world:</p>

					<p class="f4">Life is the same as body,<br/>
					or Life and body are different:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata exists after death<br/>
					or The Tathāgata exists not after death,<br/>
					or He both exists and exists not after death,<br/>
					or The Tathāgata neither exists nor not-exists after death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do I say this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks,<br/>
					these thoughts are not concerned with profit,<br/>
					they are not the rudiments of the holy life,<br/>
					they conduce not to revulsion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					to tranquillity,<br/>
					to full understanding,<br/>
					to the perfect wisdom,<br/>
					they conduce not to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">When ye reason, monks, reason thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice<br/>
					that leads to the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do I say this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks,<br/>
					these thoughts are concerned with profit,<br/>
					they are rudiments of the holy life,<br/>
					they conduce to revulsion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					to tranquillity,<br/>
					to full understanding,<br/>
					to the perfect wisdom,<br/>
					they conduce to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice<br/>
					that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
