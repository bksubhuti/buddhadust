					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, wage not wordy warfare,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You know not about this Norm-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do know about this Norm-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">How could you know about it?</p>

					<p class="f4">You have fallen on wrong views.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have come by right views.</p>

					<p class="f4">You spoke last what should come first,<br/>
					and first what should come last.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am speaking to the point,<br/>
					you are not.</p>

					<p class="f4">What you have thought out so long<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span> is quite upset.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your view is confuted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go, explain yourself.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are shown up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clear yourself if you can!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do I say this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks,<br/>
					such talk is not concerned with profit,<br/>
					they are not the rudiments of the holy life,<br/>
					they conduce not to revulsion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					to tranquillity,<br/>
					to full understanding,<br/>
					to the perfect wisdom,<br/>
					they conduce not to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">When ye talk, monks, talk about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice<br/>
					that leads to the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do I say this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks,<br/>
					such talk is concerned with profit,<br/>
					they are rudiments of the holy life,<br/>
					they conduce to revulsion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					to tranquillity,<br/>
					to full understanding,<br/>
					to the perfect wisdom,<br/>
					they conduce to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice<br/>
					that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
