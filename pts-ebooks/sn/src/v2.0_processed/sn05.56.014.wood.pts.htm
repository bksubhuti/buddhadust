					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth about Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth about about the ceasing of Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth about Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">Ill, it should be said,<br/>
					is the six personal spheres of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">The sense-sphere of the eye,<br/>
					the sense-sphere of the ear,<br/>
					the sense-sphere of the nose,<br/>
					the sense-sphere of the tongue,<br/>
					the sense-sphere of the body,<br/>
					the sense-sphere of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br/>
					'the Ariyan truth about Ill.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is that craving<br/>
					that leads back to rebirth,<br/>
					along with the lure and the lust<br/>
					that linger longingly now here,<br/>
					now there:<br/>
					namely,<br/>
					the craving for sensual delight,<br/>
					the craving to be born again,<br/>
					the craving for existence to end.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth about the ceasing of Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily it is the utter passionless cessation of,<br/>
					the giving up,<br/>
					the forsaking,<br/>
					the release from,<br/>
					the absence of<br/>
					longing for this craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the Ariyan truth about the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily it is this Ariyan eightfold way,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view,<br/>
					right aim,<br/>
					right speech,<br/>
					right action,<br/>
					right living,<br/>
					right effort,<br/>
					right mindfulness,<br/>
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
