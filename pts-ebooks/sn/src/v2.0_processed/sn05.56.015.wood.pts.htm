					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, do ye bear in mind<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths<br/>
					taught by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words a certain monk said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, lord, do bear in mind<br/>
					the Ariyan truths<br/>
					taught by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[363]</b></span> "And how, monk, do you bear in mind<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths<br/>
					taught by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br/>
					Ill is the first Ariyan truth<br/>
					taught by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br/>
					the arising of Ill is the second Ariyan truth<br/>
					taught by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br/>
					the ceasing of Ill is the third Ariyan truth<br/>
					taught by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br/>
					the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/>
					is the fourth Ariyan truth<br/>
					taught by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, lord, is how I bear in mind<br/>
					the Ariyan truths<br/>
					taught by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well done, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">You rightly bear in mind<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths<br/>
					taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ill<br/>
					was indeed taught by me<br/>
					as the first Ariyan truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">The arising of Ill<br/>
					was taught by me<br/>
					as the the second Ariyan truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ceasing of Ill<br/>
					was taught by me<br/>
					as the the third Ariyan truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">The practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br/>
					was the fourth Ariyan truth<br/>
					taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monk, do you bear in mind<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths<br/>
					taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
