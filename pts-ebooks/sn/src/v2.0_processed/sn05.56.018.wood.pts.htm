					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk came to see the Exalted One<br/>
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br/>
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br/>
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Knowledge! Knowledge,' is the saying, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, what is knowledge,<br/>
					and how far is one possessed of knowledge?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monk, knowing about Ill,<br/>
					its arising,<br/>
					its ceasing<br/>
					and about the practice that leads to its ceasing<br/>
					is called 'knowledge,'<br/>
					and he who has this knowledge<br/>
					is one possessed of knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
