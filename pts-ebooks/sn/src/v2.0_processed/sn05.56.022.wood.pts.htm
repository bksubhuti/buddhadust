					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Vajjians<br/>
					at Koṭigāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/>
					understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					'This is Ill';<br/>
					who understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					'this is the arising of Ill';<br/>
					who understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					'this is the ceasing of Ill';<br/>
					who understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill', -<br/>
					such are not reckoned as recluses<br/>
					among recluses<br/>
					nor as brahmins<br/>
					among brahmins,<br/>
					nor have those worthies,<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					of themselves realized<br/>
					by their own knowledge<br/>
					the reality of recluseship<br/>
					or of brahminhood.</p>

					<p class="f4">But whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br/>
					have understood,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					'This is Ill';<br/>
					who have understood,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					'this is the arising of Ill';<br/>
					who have understood,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					'this is the ceasing of Ill';<br/>
					who have understood,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill', -<br/>
					such are not reckoned as recluses<br/>
					among recluses<br/>
					nor as brahmins<br/>
					among brahmins,<br/>
					nor have those worthies,<br/>
					in this very life,<br/>
					of themselves realized<br/>
					by their own knowledge<br/>
					the reality of recluseship<br/>
					or of brahminhood."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Having thus spoken<br/>
					the Happy One added this as Teacher:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Who understand not Ill, and how Ill comes to be,<br/>
							And how Ill ceases utterly without remains,<br/>
							Nor know the Way that leads on to Ill's ending,<br/>
							Such lack the heart's release, they lack release by insight.<br/>
							Helpless to make an end, to birth and eld they go.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">But understanding Ill and how Ill comes to be,<br/>
							And where Ill ceases utterly without remains,<br/>
							Knowing the Way that leads on to Ill's ending,<br/>
							Blessed with the heart's release, blessed with release by insight,<br/>
							They, able to end all, go not to birth and eld.</p>
