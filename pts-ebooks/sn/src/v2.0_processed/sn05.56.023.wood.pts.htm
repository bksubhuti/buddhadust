					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth about Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth about about the ceasing of Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, by the fact of understanding,<br/>
					as they really are,<br/>
					these four Ariyan truths,<br/>
					a Tathāgata is called<br/>
					'Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
