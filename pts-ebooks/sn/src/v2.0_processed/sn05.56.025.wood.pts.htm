					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, in him who knows,<br/>
					in him who sees,<br/>
					do I declare the āsavas to be destroyed:<br/>
					not in him who knows not,<br/>
					who sees not.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the destruction of the āsavas<br/>
					in him who knows,<br/>
					who sees?</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who knows, who sees:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill',</p>

					<p class="f4">there is destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who knows, who sees:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill',</p>

					<p class="f4">there is destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who knows, who sees:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill',</p>

					<p class="f4">there is destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who knows, who sees:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill',</p>

					<p class="f4">there is destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[368]</b></span> Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
