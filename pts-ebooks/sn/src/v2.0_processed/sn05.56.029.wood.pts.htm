					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī,<br/>
					at Jeta Grove,<br/>
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth about Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth about about the ceasing of Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these four Ariyan truths,<br/>
					one is to be fully understood,<br/>
					one is to be abandoned,<br/>
					one is to be realized,<br/>
					one is to be cultivated.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Which Ariyan truth is to be fully understood?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[369]</b></span> Ill, as an Ariyan truth,<br/>
					is to be fully understood.</p>

					<p class="f4">The arising of Ill,<br/>
					as an Ariyan truth,<br/>
					is to be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ceasing of Ill,<br/>
					as an Ariyan truth,<br/>
					is to be realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">The practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,<br/>
					as an Ariyan truth,<br/>
					is to be cultivated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
