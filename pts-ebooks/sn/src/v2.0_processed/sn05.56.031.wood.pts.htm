					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[370]</b></span> </p>

					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī<br/>
					in Siṇsapā Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br/>
					gathering up a few siṃsapa leaves in his hand,<br/>
					said to the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which are the more numerous,<br/>
					just this mere handful of Siṇsapā leaves I have here,<br/>
					or those in the grove overhead?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very few in number, lord,<br/>
					are the leaves in the handful<br/>
					gathered up by the Exalted One:<br/>
					much more in number<br/>
					are those in the grove overhead."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just so, monks,<br/>
					much more in number<br/>
					are those things I have found out,<br/>
					but not revealed;<br/>
					very few<br/>
					are the things I have revealed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, monks, have I not revealed them?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they are not concerned with profit,<br/>
					they are not rudiments of the holy life,<br/>
					they conduce not to revulsion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					to tranquIllity,<br/>
					to full comprehension,<br/>
					to the perfect wisdom,<br/>
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why I have not revealed them.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And what is it, monks, that I have revealed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just that</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice<br/>
					that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks,<br/>
					this is concerned with profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the rudiments of the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does conduce to revulsion,<br/>
					to dispassion,<br/>
					to cessation,<br/>
					to tranquIllity,<br/>
					to full comprehension,<br/>
					to the perfect wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does conduce to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore have I revealed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
