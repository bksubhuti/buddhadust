					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"So long, monks, as moon and sun<br/>
					arise not in the world,<br/>
					so long is there no shining forth<br/>
					of great light,<br/>
					of great radiance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then is there gloom and darkness,<br/>
					a murk of gloom and darkness,<br/>
					no telling whether it is night or day,<br/>
					no telling of months<br/>
					or half-months<br/>
					and the seasons of the year.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, when moon and sun<br/>
					shine in the world,<br/>
					then is there a shining forth<br/>
					of great light,<br/>
					of great radiance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then is there no more gloom and darkness,<br/>
					no more murk of gloom and darkness,<br/>
					but one can tell whether it is night or day,<br/>
					one can tell the months<br/>
					and the half-months<br/>
					and the seasons of the year.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, monks, so long as a Tathāgata<br/>
					arises not in the world,<br/>
					even so long is there no shining forth<br/>
					of the light,<br/>
					of great radiance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then is there gloom and darkness,<br/>
					a murk of gloom and darkness,<br/>
					then is there no proclamation<br/>
					of the four Ariyan truths,<br/>
					no teaching,<br/>
					no setting forth,<br/>
					no establishing,<br/>
					opening up,<br/>
					analyzing<br/>
					or making of them plain.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, as soon as a Tathāgata<br/>
					arises in the world,<br/>
					then is there a shining forth<br/>
					of great light,<br/>
					of great radiance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then is there no more gloom and darkness,<br/>
					no more murk of gloom and darkness;<br/>
					then is there proclamation<br/>
					of the four Ariyan truths,<br/>
					then is there teaching,<br/>
					setting forth,<br/>
					establishing,<br/>
					opening up,<br/>
					analyzing<br/>
					and making of them plain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what four Ariyan truths?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
