					<p><span class="f2 g"><b>[375]</b></span></p>

					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">such maybe scan the face<br/>
					of<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span> some recluse or brahmin<br/>
					and conclude:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely this worthy<br/>
					is one who knowing knows<br/>
					and seeing sees!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks,<br/>
					a tuft of cotton-wool<br/>
					or a ball of thistledown,<br/>
					lightly wafted on the wind,<br/>
					is cast down on level ground,<br/>
					and the east wind whirls it west,<br/>
					and the west wind whirls it east,<br/>
					the north wind whirls it south<br/>
					and the south wind whirls it north.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is the lightness<br/>
					of the ball of thistledown.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, monks,<br/>
					whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill;'|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">understand not,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">such maybe scan the face<br/>
					of some recluse or brahmin and conclude:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely this worthy<br/>
					is one who knowing knows<br/>
					and seeing sees!'</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is through not seeing clearly<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But whatsoever recluses or brahmins do understand,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">do understand,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">do understand,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">do understand,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">such scan not the face<br/>
					of some recluse or brahmin<br/>
					and conclude:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely this worthy<br/>
					is one who knowing knows<br/>
					and seeing sees!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, just as an iron pillar<br/>
					or threshould of a door<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					or some deep-set pedestal<br/>
					is unshakable,<br/>
					unquakable:<br/>
					if there came from the eastern quarter<br/>
					a violent blast of wind and rain,<br/>
					it could not shake it,<br/>
					could not make it quake<br/>
					and quake again;<br/>
					if there came from the western quarter<br/>
					a violent blast of wind and rain,<br/>
					it could not shake it,<br/>
					could not make it quake<br/>
					and quake again;<br/>
					if there came from the northern quarter<br/>
					a violent blast of wind and rain,<br/>
					it could not shake it,<br/>
					could not make it quake<br/>
					and quake again;<br/>
					if there came from the southern quarter<br/>
					a violent blast of wind and rain,<br/>
					it could not shake it,<br/>
					could not make it quake<br/>
					and quake again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks, that threshould is deep set,<br/>
					that pedestal is deep set.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins do understand,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">do understand,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">do understand,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">do understand,<br/>
					as it really is,<br/>
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">such need not to scan not the face<br/>
					of some recluse or brahmin<br/>
					and <span class="f2 g"><b>[376]</b></span> conclude:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely this worthy<br/>
					is one who knowing knows<br/>
					and seeing sees!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of seeing clear<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
