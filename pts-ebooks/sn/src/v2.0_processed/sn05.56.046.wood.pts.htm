					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there is a darkness of interstellar space,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span><br/>

					such a murk of darkness as cannot enjoy<br/>
					the splendour of this moon and sun,<br/>
					though they be of such mighty magic power and majesty."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br/>
					a certain monk said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, that must be a mighty darkness,<br/>
					a mighty darkness indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any other darkness<br/>
					greater and more fearsome than that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is indeed, monk,<br/>
					another darkness,<br/>
					greater and more fearsome."</p>
