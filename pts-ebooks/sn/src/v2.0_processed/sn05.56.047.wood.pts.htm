					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, a man should throw into the mighty ocean<br/>
					a yoke with a single hole,<br/>
					and there were a blind turtle<br/>
					to pop up to the surface<br/>
					once in every hundred years.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that blind turtle push his neck<br/>
					through that yoke with one hole<br/>
					whenever he popped up to the surface,<br/>
					once at the end of every hundred years?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It might be so, lord,<br/>
					now and again,<br/>
					after the lapse of a long time."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, monks, sooner I declare<br/>
					would that blind turtle push his neck<br/>
					through that yoke with one hole,<br/>
					popping up to the surface<br/>
					once in a hundred years,<br/>
					than would a fool<br/>
					who has gone to the Downfall<br/>
					become a man again.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks, here prevails<br/>
					no practice of the holy life,<br/>
					no righteous living,<br/>
					no doing of good deeds,<br/>
					no working of merit,<br/>
					but just cannibalism<br/>
					and preying on weaker creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is through not seeing<br/>
					the four Ariyan truths,<br/>
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br/>
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill,<br/>
					<span class="f2 g"><b>[384]</b></span> the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <i>Chiggaḷa.</i> <i>Cf.</i> above and <i>M.</i> iii, 169; <i>Expos.</i> i, 80; <i>Sisters,</i> 173; <i>Brethren,</i> 30; <i>Mil. Panh.,</i> 204.</p>

						

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> At <i>M.</i> iii, 169, he may become a man again, but only in a low caste, in miserable conditions. Apparently those who fail to reach the state of Stream-winning by the end of the kalpa are 'thrown down' and have to begin again an elementary condition when the next kalpa starts.</p>
