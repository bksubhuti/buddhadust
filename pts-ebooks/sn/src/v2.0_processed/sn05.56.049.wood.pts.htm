					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, a man should lay down on Sineru, lord of mountains,<br/>
					seven grains of gravel<br/>
					as large as beans.<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a></sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the more,<br/>
					those seven grains of gravel<br/>
					as large as beans laid there,<br/>
					or Sineru, lord of mountains?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[385]</b></span> "Why, lord, this is greater,<br/>
					this Sineru, lord of mountains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Very small are the seven grains of gravel laid down<br/>
					as large as beans.</p>

					<p class="f4">They cannot be reckoned,<br/>
					cannot be compared with it:<br/>
					they do not come to<br/>
					the merest fraction of a part<br/>
					when compared with Sineru, lord of mountains."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, monks, for the Ariyan disciple<br/>
					who is blessed with vision,<br/>
					for a person of understanding,<br/>
					far greater is this Ill<br/>
					which he has destroyed,<br/>
					which he has used up,<br/>
					and infinitely small<br/>
					is that Ill which remains.</p>

					<p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br/>
					cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not come to<br/>
					the merest fraction of a part of it,<br/>
					when set beside that Ill<br/>
					which he has destroyed,<br/>
					which he has used up, -<br/>
					that is, it is just a period<br/>
					of seven lives at most,<span class="f3"><sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a></sup></span><br/>
					for the man who understands,<br/>
					as it really is:<br/>
					the meaning of:<br/>
					'this is Ill'<br/>
					who understands,<br/>
					as it really is:<br/>
					the meaning of:<br/>
					'this is the arising of Ill'<br/>
					who understands,<br/>
					as it really is:<br/>
					the meaning of:<br/>
					'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br/>
					who understands,<br/>
					as it really is:<br/>
					the meaning of:<br/>
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
