					<p class="f4">T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br/>
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, the mighty earth should waste away,<br/>
					come to an end,<br/>
					all except just seven balls of clay<br/>
					as big as kola-stones.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the greater:<br/>
					that part of the mighty earth<br/>
					which has wasted away,<br/>
					come to an end,<br/>
					or those seven balls of clay,<br/>
					as big as kola-stones,<br/>
					that remain?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, lord, greater is that part of the mighty earth<br/>
					which has wasted away,<br/>
					come to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exceeding small are the seven balls of clay<br/>
					as big as kola-stones<br/>
					that remain:<br/>
					they cannot be reckoned,<br/>
					cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not amount to the merest fraction<br/>
					of a part of the mighty earth<br/>
					that has wasted away,<br/>
					come to an end, -<br/>
					those seven balls of clay<br/>
					as big as kola-stones."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, just so, monks,<br/>
					for the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with vision,<br/>
					for the person who has understanding,<br/>
					far greater is this Ill which he has destroyed,<br/>
					which he has used up,<br/>
					and infinitely small<br/>
					is that Ill which remains.</p>

					<p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br/>
					cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction<br/>
					of a part of it<br/>
					when set beside that Ill<br/>
					which he has destroyed,<br/>
					which he has used up, -<br/>
					that is, it is just a period of seven lives at most<br/>
					for the man who understands,<br/>
					as it really is:<br/>
					the meaning of:<br/>
					'this is Ill'<br/>
					who understands,<br/>
					as it really is:<br/>
					the meaning of:<br/>
					'this is the arising of Ill'<br/>
					who understands,<br/>
					as it really is:<br/>
					the meaning of:<br/>
					'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br/>
					who understands,<br/>
					as it really is:<br/>
					the meaning of:<br/>
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
